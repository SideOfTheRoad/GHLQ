こんなちなみを ・・ ・・  ユルしてはいただけませんの？I'm playing Ace Attorney 3 (逆転裁判３), and there's a girl in the dock (ちなみ) giving evidence. She's just been found to be lying about something and is asking for forgiveness.I've seen the pattern ～ていただけませんか as a humble request, but why has she put a は after the て
What is the difference between endings なし and 抜【ぬ】き when you want to exclude a certain ingredient from food Aside from 氷【こおり】なし when ordering soft drinks, I thought that for most other things 抜【ぬ】き should be used. But my friend has been saying 卵【たまご】なし to get rid of an egg, so I'm curious when which one of those is appropriate.
What does うぃーす exactly mean (I vaguely hear it when people greet each other.) How is it different from other greetingsIs it correct to write it as うぃす tooHow to properly type it on a Macbook  The い is a smaller font, and I don't know how to type ー.
This question already has answers here:                                            Difference between -ていく and -てくる                                (3 answers)                            Closed 6 years ago.I came across すすんで行く and さいて行く in a vocabulary list, and it was immediately obvious that there was probably some sort of grammatical construct involving て行く that was in use here.  I don't really know what this grammatical construct means though, and it's apparently something different than just compounding two arbitrary verbs together with base te.A quick Google search brought this lesson up, and he starts to explain what the construct means (as well as て来る), but he doesn't do a very good job of it.  He also starts to deviate from the special grammatical construct towards just the base te verb compounding, and many of the other search results are focusing almost exclusively on the compounding.I vaguely get the notion of this construct meaning to get into the state of doing something (て行く) or to have come into the state of doing something (て来る), but I really don't understand it.Could somebody please explain this  I'm mainly wondering about the general grammar being used here, but I also kind of wonder about how it applies to these two words, since they're apparently decent examples.  Thank you.
I am following a book called "Teach Yourself Japanese", right now I am on using adjectives.In there, there is an example:Igirisu no jamu wa totemo oishii desu.Which I can understand in terms of structure and rules etc..But in the book, it says that when an adjective is in the negative, "Amari" must be used. So:Igirisu no jamu wa totemo amari oishii desu.Is there a reason why amari is used Or can anyone give me some more information about this word
I'm trying to say this in Japanese: "Woe be to those who near the swamp."I wasn't really sure how to go about this, but I came up with this:それらのための災いは誰が沼に行きますWoe for those who go to the swamp.Is this correct at all I'm very unsure about this sentence. Perhaps there's a better way of saying this
I was wondering the difference between the two words since both mean to walk.When to use verb 歩きます and when to use 散歩します。
I will take 客 as an example:Can 客 form a compound with 席, 娟, and all the other thousands of Japanese 漢字If I put 席客, but not 客席, will the meaning be different Or will it just have no meaning Or is it only a grammar error Even if it's a grammar error, can the meaning still be understoodHow flexible is the formation of kanji compounds
I don't have any kanji reference books so I have to rely on kanji sites for kanji information.A lot of websites list 入 （いる） as the radical for 全:Jisho beta (as well as other sites which use the Kanjidic database)Go-kankenKanjijitenQuusjust to name a few. But, two sites, which seemed pretty reliable to me up until now, list 人 （ひと） as the radical.KakijunKanji AliveI'm more inclined towards 入 right now due to the number of sources saying so, but I want to make sure.
What is the etymology of the old province and Japanese name 武蔵Wikipedia claims that it is non-Yamato vocabulary from an Ainu language. Even if this is true, why were these characters (military/weapon + store) chosen as ateji
I came across this question, and found the same meaning in the dictionary for both options(a-危ない)　or　(b-危うい)　ですから　下がってくださいhowever the answer booklet says it is (a-危ない), what is the difference
As explained in the thread Difference between そうです、 ようです and らしいです., when describing what you think are the thoughts of another person, might 「思っているようです。」 be more appropriate than 「思っている。」(1) 今{いま}の景気{けいき}では、Bobさんによれば、株価{かぶか}が高{たか}いと思っている。(2) 今の景気では、Bobさんによれば、株価が高いと思っているようです。I think that #2 sounds better.Other than speaking for myself, or a group that I represent, is not 「思っているようです」 the better option After all, you are only capable of stating what you think the other person appears to be thinking.
This question already has an answer here:                                            思っている/言っている with third person subject                                (1 answer)                            Closed 6 years ago.I've read from many grammar books that when we are talking about a third people thinking about something, we must use 思っている, and it means "think" instead of "be thinking". For example:スミスさんは日本の物価は高いと思っている  is correctスミスさんは日本の物価は高いと思う　　    is considered incorrectI've tried to find the reason, however, any documents I could find states only the rule without explanation. I really wish to know if there are any grammatical or cultural reasons for this.
I'm having trouble understanding a translation I've encountered in Makino and Tsutsui's Dictionary of Intermediate Japanese grammar, under とする1.The original sentence is as follows:一男【かずお】を養子【ようし】とすることには依存【いぞん】はない。Which the textbook translates into:I have no objection to regarding Kazuo as our adopted son.According to the dictionaries, 依存 can only assume the meaning of "dependence", not "objection".デジタル大辞泉:「依存」とは、他に頼って存在、または生活すること。「会の運営を寄付金に―する」「―心」EDICT:dependence; dependent; reliance Which should make the original sentence, given the lack of any context, translate into something like this:There is no dependence on regarding Kazuo as (our) adopted child. ()The meaning of this sentence is unclear, although it would have probably made more sense given the broader context that I don't have.My question is whether it is possible for 依存 to be interpreted as "objection" in this (or any other) sentence and why.
I saw this scathing review of KY式日本語 on Amazon JP. This is the full sentence I'm asking about:出版する意味を感じられない本は多数世に出ているが、これほど無駄な本というのもまた珍しいIgnoring the もまた part, what I get from this isWhile a lot of books where I don't see the point of publishing has come out, a "book" of such pointlessness is rare.When used together, もまた seems to be used a lot of times in the sense of "too" or "again", but it seems a bit odd if I interpreted it that way here.I'm wondering if perhaps this definition from 大辞泉 is a better fit in this context.④ （上にくる副詞を強めて）驚きいぶかしむ気持ちを表す。それにつけても。 「よく－そんなことが言えたものだ」 「どうして－そんなことをしたのだ」(Side question: does 上にくる副詞 mean the adverbs that follows また)Though that would still leave me in the dark about も's function here.Thoughts
I'm playing The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past（ゼルダの伝説：神々のトライフォース）and this sentence came up (spoken by one of the 7 maidens):ハイリアの民は、ふしぎな力を  あやつることが、できたと言います。I think this means "It is said that the Hylian people could harness/manipulate a mysterious power.". Why did they use と言います instead of と言われています I thought that's how you'd indicate a myth or some widely-believed story.
Even here in Osaka I don't hear it very often among anyone even remotely young, but where does this come from originally Does anyone have a reference on handIf I myself had to guess from what I know of classical Japanese I would think it could be（打ち消し）ぬ　→　（連用形）に　+　あり　+　たり　→　にありたり　→　にありた　→　なりた　→　なんだThanks.
How can I express the idea that one word sounds like anotherAs a concrete example, I wanted to say, 「フライアー」sounds like 「fryer」.Looking in dictionaries (wadoku/jisho) for "sound like" turns up 「がましい」, but I could only find one example sentence with that phrase on tatoeba, and it was used in a different way ("that sounds too forward").Is there a better way to express what I want to say Or, if がましい is actually correct, how exactly would I use this expression
I was reading a page (http://kids.goo.ne.jp/shirabemono/detail.htmlid=153), but I couldn't understand this phrase:音楽は、音をきいたりかなでたりして楽しむものだね。I understand the "tari form" (or whatever it is called) is being used here, first with 聞く, then with another verb. But I couldn't figure out which verb is かなでたり.So, which verb is it Thank you.
I'm having trouble trying to understand a fragment from a dialogue between two students in the book "An Integrated Approach to Intermediate Japanese".I do know that 今度 means "now", "next time", or "another time", and 一度 means "once". But in the conversation between the two students they use 今度一度:加藤: でも上手じゃありませんよ。トム: 今度一度やりましょうか。How should I understand 今度一度 in the previous fragment of the dialogue
I know it's a complicated grammar concept that even Japanese don't fully get, but I'd like to know what's the difference between明日は火曜日ですand明日が火曜日ですThey way I understand it, in the second sentence you're indicating that tomorrow, and not any other day, is Tuesday.  And in the first one, you're indicating that tomorrow is Tuesday, and not any other day.Would this be correct
I have learned from my previous studies that it is みんで.However, Google translate seems to give me the answer みて.Which is correct
I understand that ことになる has the meaning "It has been decided that" and can be used to point to a ritual or habit of a society like taking off your shoes.However, I don't get what it means when it is like this:あすで１週間雨が降りつづくことになる。  How is that different from say, あすで１週間雨が降りつづくようになる。  Thankyou :)
Person A : "I am sick today"Person B : "Oh no!" How do the Japanese express feelings of negative shock towards bad news What would Person B say in Japanese
Reading an article on NHK, it starts with this sentence about the missing Algerian plane. The French foreign minister says that it probably crashed in northern Mali:西アフリカのブルキナファソからアルジェリアに向かう途中消息を絶ったアルジェリア航空の旅客機について、最も多くの乗客が乗っていたフランスのファビウス外相は、２つの国の間に位置するマリの北部で墜落したという見方を示しましたThe part I'm confused about is this:最も多くの乗客が乗っていたThis seems to mean that "most passengers were on board" when the plane crashed. Is that what it means Where else would they be

There is a question in my Japanese book to translate a sentence. This is how I translated it:わたし の てがみ の うえ の つくえ を よまないで。But, this is how my book translated it:つくえ の  うえ の わたし の てがみ を よまないで。Are there any differences in meaning or nuance Or is it acceptable to use either one

I've been reading a text and all three of these come up 影 vs 形 vs 形状. I know they mean shape/figure, but is there a more nuanced difference between them I can see the logic of where they are in the text but I can't figure out the difference.
Entry 3734 of the 万葉集 reads as follows1:等【ト】保【ホ】伎【キ】山【やま】 世【セ】伎【キ】毛【モ】故【コ】要【エ】伎【キ】奴【ヌ】 伊【イ】麻【マ】左【サ】良【ラ】尓【ニ】 安【ア】布【フ】倍【ベ】伎【キ】与【ヨ】之【シ】能【ノ】 奈【ナ】伎【キ】我【ガ】佐【サ】夫【ブ】之【シ】佐 【サ】Transcribed in more modern Japanese style, this reads:遠【とほ】き山【やま】関【せき】も越【こ】え来【き】ぬ今【いま】さらに逢【あ】ふべきよしのなきが寂【さぶ】しさIt is noted that in certain 万葉集 transcriptions, the last four characters are transcribed as 左【サ】必【ビ】之【シ】佐 【サ】 （寂【さび】しさ）. However, what interests me about this alternate transcription is that the 万葉仮名 used for ビ is devoiced; generally it is read as 必【ヒ】. I do understand that, at least for the subsequent thousand years or so, the marking of voicing was inconsistent at best, but I was under the impression that in 上代特殊仮名遣【じょうだいとくしゅかなづかい】, a distinction between voiced and voiceless consonants was in use.So why is this read as ビ Am I wrong that a 清濁 distinction is in use generally within the 万葉集Note: incidentally, every other usage of 必【ヒ】 in the 万葉集 is devoiced. Sadly, the reference above is the only usage of サビシ in the 万葉集.References1 http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/japanese/manyoshu/Man15Yo.htmlNote: I originally mistakenly claimed that the 万葉仮名「夫」 was normally read as 夫【フ】. This is not true and I have updated the question to reflect this.
On the 助動詞 wikipedia page there is this sentence and I can't make sense of the part in bold:助詞「の」「ので」「のに」等が続く場合に使われる。連体形だが名詞を修飾することはできない。なお、形容動詞を品詞と認めない立場では別の考え方になる。Here is my try :(Those 連体形 are) only used when preceding things like 「の」「のに」「ので」. However, a noun cannot use those 連体形 in order to modify (another element). Moreover, from the view point which does not recognize na-adjectives and () parts of speech, there is another way of thinking .May somebody help me so as to understand this part
Example sentence:オオカミのことばに従い、　森に行った。What is the meaning of this construction Does it have a special meaning
I'm writing a report for a class, and at first I wrote:　［…］どのような批判があろうが［…］But then I sat back and thought, maybe it should actually be:　［…］どのような批判があろうと［…］But now I'm not sure if there's actually a difference, or if there is, how it actually affects the meaning in this case. So... do these actually have different meanings/connotations And if so, how soThanks for your help!
When used with a noun ために could have two meanings :(1) 学生のために、奨学金がある。There are scholarships for (the sake of) students.(2) 学生のために、学校の規則に従わなければならない。Since s/he is a student s/he has to obey the rules set by her/his school.With the second meaning, it is possible to express "the state of being a student". Indeed, I can rephrase the second translation as "Since s/he is in the state of being a student s/he" has to obey the rules set by her/his school.Thus it is possible to express this state in the past.(3) 学生だったために、学校の規則に従わなければならなかった.Since s/he was (in the state of being) a student, she had to obey the rules set by her/his school.In this sense of expressing a state, の is equivalent to である, right So I can rephrase (2) as 学生であるために、... and since である and だ are somewhat equivalent I should be able to rewrite this as 学生なために (since な is the 連体形 of だ).So the question is: Is all this possible or mere speculation
I find it much more sincere to accept compliments and show how grateful I am rather than to belittle myself. Therefore I would like to know some phrases in Japanese to accept compliments and show my gratitude rather than overhumbling myself (e.g. not まだまだ）.How do you accept compliments in Japanese without coming off as really arrogant (taking into consideration that the Japanese culture in general highly values modesty and humility) Although in the West it is certainly possible to accept compliments and be modest at the same time.E.g. in English we might say:"I'm very happy to hear that!""I'm glad you liked it (for a performance or something like that)""It's very kind of you to say that."Thank you
Example : As a friend, I think we should...What do you add to ともだち to add the "As a" prefixAlso, after that part, does the rest of the sentence follow the normal rules of a Japanese sentence What I mean is, could I comfortably add "As a friend" at the start of any Japanese sentence without changing anything for it to make senseEdit : Also, if you could put your answers in both Kanji and kana, that would be great, since I do not understand Kanji yet. Thanks
I have some questions about the difference between 係 and 担当.Do these words have the same meaning Basically, can they be used interchangeably as "the person/group in charge of something"I know that there can be more than one 係 in a department (for example, when sending an email, it seems like 経理係　御中 is acceptable), but can there be more than one 担当 Or does 担当 only point to one person within a department On a similar note, if you don't know who the person in charge is, should you write ～担当　御中 or ～担当者　様Thanks!
It is very difficult to find literature on this topic and the only related question is Splicing である with a topic whose answer is (to my view) a bit elusive and the reference provided by snailboat is way beyond my understanding.So my question is when it is possible to split the two entities of である and what can be put in between
To create ～なければいけません or similar forms, I've been having trouble finding the exact method for conjugating into ～なければ. I imagine (but also greatly doubt) that it's something like this: 食べる -&gt; 食べない -&gt; 食べなく -&gt; 食べなける -&gt; 食べければ. However, even if it was like that I still wouldn't really understand why. Can anyone explain the exact process to get from ～ない to ～なければ
To add a bit more to my question, I'm wondering if the words are used interchangeably, or if 法度 has more a sense of law that is set up to ban or prohibit something  Is 法度 a commonly used word
I just started playing the video game Mother 3, and if you try to examine the trash can in front of his house, Lucas says, 問題なし.I expect this means something like, "no problem here", but I haven't been able to confirm that so far.What kind of construction is the なし part
It doesn't apply to all the words, just some. Here are examples of words from that are marked with that symbol 悪い　(with reading にくい): 大辞泉; 大辞林面倒くさい　(with reading めんどくさい): 大辞泉; 大辞林皆 (with reading みんな): 大辞泉; 大辞林判る・解る (with reading わかる): 大辞泉;　大辞林The thing is even for the same word, 大辞林 and 大辞泉 places the ▽ symbol at different positions.For your convenience, here are 2 cropped screenshots to illustrate what I mean:From 大辞林From 大辞泉Apparently 明鏡国語辞典 uses this symbol too. Here's a screenshot for 解る・判る from an EPWING viewer.As far as I know, 広辞苑 doesn't use this symbol. See belowAs I'm typing this, I noticed a pattern: the symbol seems to indicate that the reading is either non-standard or not-so-common for that particular kanji. Several kanji references seem to support this interpretation. Take 悪 for example, kakijun mentions "にく(む)[常用外]", and 漢字辞典ネット labels "にく(む)" with 準1 (which I assume is the second highest level in 漢検).　Same for 判る and 解る, whereas みんな and ど aren't listed as reading for 皆 and 倒 (perhaps those are more colloquial).It's just that 大辞泉 and 大辞林 uses different convention: for 大辞泉 it's the kanji to the right of ▽, for 大辞林 it's the kanji to the left of ▽.Am I going in the right direction with this interpretation
I got this from a Japanese bar owner, she said it means "bamboo", but I used Google translate and can't find a similar word that looks like that. Also, is it possible to type out this word
I am confused in determining the correct way to write furigana.Is a furigana only allowed to be attached to a single kanji character In other words, can a furigana attached to more than one kanji character If a furigana can only be attached to a single kanji, how to write furiganas for, e.g., 今日Where should the　っ which is the small つ be positioned in furiganas for words, e.g., 一緒 Which one is the correct one  一{い}  緒{っしょ}　or  一{いっ} 緒{しょ}Is it correct to write　居{い}所{どころ}　instead of 居{い}所{ところ}
Were I in a situation where I want to get the attention of a waitress in a noisy restaurant, I  kind of feel like calling-out: "お姉{ねえ}さん、すみませんが、ビールもう一本お願いできますか？". I think that I've seen this done in a movie, as well as seen native speakers do this in front of me (but only at a bar where everyone was pretty drunk).However, I think I've been told that addressing a waitress, or waiter, as お姉さん, or お兄{にい}さん, is impolite. Is this correctAddressing a waitress as お嬢{じょう}さん is off the charts impolite, rightSay that I am at a beer garden and want to get the attention of one of the waitresses by saying お姉さん, what would be an appropriate substitute Is just not addressing her at all the only way
How do you say "to ask for" in Japanese.  For example:He asked his boss for a raise.We ask for great revival.Is "仰{あお}ぐ" fine  In particular, I want to use something that's natural and normal, but that's not disrespectful to superiors.  Some of the usual sources, like jisho.org, don't seem to be very definitive about this.
I have trouble understanding the following sentence:ルーカスさんは、自分をファーストネームで呼んでもらいたいと言うけれども、三年も年上の人なので、どうも「トム」とは呼びにくい。Is it. Mister Lukas wants to get called by his first name but it's hard to do so because he is 3 years older than the speaker. Or does the speaker wants to call him TomI don't know to whom 自分 is pointing, isn't it always pointing to the speaker In this case the sentence wouldn't make sense since the speaker wants to receive something "もらいたい".I think I am confusing either the 自分 or the もらいたい part.
This is something that is often said in English to politely ask a question while avoiding sounding overly intrusive.  For example,What do you do for a living, if you don't mind my askingThe way that I would think to translate it is:聞いてもよろしければ、何の仕事をしているのですか。But I'm not entirely confident, because that's a literal translation, and there may be a more natural sounding set-phrase for it. Is my translation correct Or is there a better way to say it
I've been wondering how to say 'I spent the past [time frame] [insert action]'. For example, "I spent the past hour studying Japanese". Would it be translated to something like...日本語の勉強は最近の一時間が全かかりました...or would it be something like...日本語の勉強はついさっきの一時間が全かかりました。OR! Would the sentence structure be completely differentI'm sorry if this has already been asked before, but I can't seem to find anything concerning this type of phrasing.
Would "私を見て突っ込む所はないか" translate to something like "Would you come take a closer look at me"I've done a lot of context searching for 突っ込む所 but I can't quite pin down a solid meaning on it.
This question already has answers here:                                            この道をまっすぐ行ってください。 Why を and not で                                (2 answers)                            Closed 6 years ago.Newcomer here. Trying to learn Japanese on my own for years now. Here's a first question. How can I make sure to learn correctly the difference between using を and で in the context of an action occurring in a given place. Meaning, what is correct to say:公園で散歩します。    or公園を散歩します。I tend to always use で in such case, but I stumble upon を at times.
Today, in some official document I received, an enumeration (of items to address) had each line prepended with ㈰, ㈪, ㈫ etc.From context, it is reasonably easy to guess that this might be an equivalent to numbers (①, ② etc) or roman letters (a, b, c etc).I am familiar with the use of half-width katakana (ｱ, ｴ, ｲ etc) for that purpose, but it is the first time I see days of the week used that way (and surprisingly, there seems to be a set of dedicated characters for it).Is there a name for this type of enumeration prefix, or at least for the characters themselvesDo they have any special meaning, beside that of a regular enumeration (first item, second item etc)Is it standard to start with ㈰ and go from there Is there anything after (土)
What is the significance of sometimes using the stem form of a verb like how the て form would be For example:燃えゆく (from HANABI)  飲みほして (from Ambiguous)It's something I hear now and again, but never understood what its grammatical roots are.
Lately I've seen in some dialog games with this difference. They use 観る rather than 見る, e.g.:・あなたテレビ観るかな。・あんまり観ない方なんだ。So I'm thinking I can use 見る to make the same dialog. However there must be a reason why they use one instead of the other. Perhaps its a simple reason...What is the difference between 見る and 観る
I'm an absolute beginner. I've learned Japanese in my spare time for less than two months. This is my first question here. Even though I think this question is potentially trivial, it's perhaps the best to ask it here anyway. Be gentle with me, please. :)I started reading basic grammar of Japanese, and found this sentence:ねこがすきです。  I like cats.I thought が is the subject particle, so I supposed that ねこ would be the subject of the sentence. すき seems to mean "like". So I expected ねこがすきです to mean "Cats like me" rather than "I like cats"; however, it seems like "I like cats" is the correct meaning, as another example バナナが好きだ (I like bananas) in the mentioned dictionary entry also has the same structure.I asked another learner and got this phrase (私は)猫が好き as the full version of ねこがすきです. However, this confuses me even further, because somehow I understand it as "Cats, I like" (and probably "Me, cats like"). And I think no matter how strange it means, it's still a perfectly fine sentence.How should I understand these two following sentences Which one means "I like cats" and which one means "Cats like me"1) 私は猫が好き  2) 猫は私が好きよろしくおねがいします！
As I understand it, それでいい means 'it is fine like this' and それがいい means 'this is fine', but what is the protagonist trying to convey here by first using それでいい and then correcting himself to それがいいBackground: This is the main character's internal dialogue. A girl (who appears to be his 憧れ{あこがれ}の人 from the same school) steps onto the bus he is on, and sparks this monologue, part of it reproduced below:もしかしたら違う{ちがう}世界に住んでるのかもしれない。  たまたま見えているだけで、手で触れよう{ふれよう}とすればかき消えて{きえて}しまいそうな──だから触って{さわって}はいけない、関わって{かかわって}はいけない。  近寄るともままならない。  そんなバカげた妄想{もうそう}すら浮かべたく{うかべたく}なるほど、彼女の存在{そんざい}は僕にとって、いい意味で異質{いしつ}であり、遠い存在だった。  僕に出来ることは、声をかけることではなく、ただただ、こうやって見守るだけだった。  と言っても、別に指をくわえてる訳{わけ}じゃない。  むしろ、この距離{きょり}がいいんだと思ってる。  きっと成績{せいせき}も優秀{ゆうしゅう}で、性格もいいんだろう。  彼女の日常{にちじょう}の中に、僕なんかが関わる余地{よち}はどこにもない。  そして僕自身、関わりたいとは思わない。  凄すぎて{すごすぎて}家には飾れない{かざれない}絵画を見ている気持ち、に近いかもしれなかった。  だから、校内で彼女の姿を探そうなんて思わない。  知り合いになりたいなんて、夢{ゆめ}に見たこともない。  同じバスに乗ってくるかどうか。  ただそれだけを気にかけて、会えた時はその偶然を素直に喜ぶ。  それでいい。  いや。  それが、いい。  ……こんな気持ちは多分、そんなに特別なことじゃないんだろう。  憧れて、そして憧れるだけで終わる感情。  おそらく、誰にでもあることなんだろう。  そして、いつかは忘れてしまう思い出なんだろうな、きっと……。Some attempt at a free translation:Rather, I think this distance is good. She's sure to have great grades  and a good personality. There's no space for me anywhere in her daily  life. And I myself even don't think that I want to have something  to do with her.It's as if I'm looking at a painting I cannot place in my home as it's  too wonderful -- or something close to that. Therefore, I'm not going to  spend my time searching for her at school. I haven't even dreamt of  being acquaintances with her.The only worry I have is whether or not she'll ride the same bus with  me. When I do meet her by chance, I can be glad without reservation.It's fine like this. No, I mean, this is good. ()These feelings are probably nothing special. Feelings of aspiration  that are nothing more. Perhaps everyone has them. And later, they'll  become memories that will sometime be forgotten.
I'm going through some basic grammar and this one website teaches the "extended" use of the word する. There is a confusing example which looks like:波の音 がするThe translation is: "(I) hear the sound of waves". The way I learned it prior to this site is:波の音 を聞くWhat is the difference between these two

Also I can't use Kanji, just Hiragana.
This question already has answers here:                                            What is the difference between 〜となる and 〜になる                                (6 answers)                            Closed 6 years ago.can someone please explain となる I read it everywhere but still don't know what it exactly means.Here's just an example sentence:この世界が心つなぐ鍵となる
そろそろ and もうすぐ can both be translated as 'soon', but I feel they have different uses and connotations.  My take on it is that そろそろ is slightly more formal and has more of a meaning of 'It's about time (we)...' as in this example:そろそろ出ましょうか？   Shall we get going / Isn't it about time we goWhereas もうすぐ sounds more urgent, and has more of a meaning of 'almost' or 'just about to', like in the following example:もうすぐ夏休みだ。  Summer vacation is just around the corner.Can these be used interchangeably  Can I say the following sentence:そろそろ夏休みだ。To me it sounds a bit stiff and formal.
I'd like to know if there is any difference between 電話する and 電話をする, if they mean the same, or if 電話をする doesn't even exist.I ask this because in an exercise in my book it says to use をする with 電話 to form the verb, but on the online dictionary I usually check it says it's 電話する, without を.Dictionary link: http://tangorin.com/general/%E9%9B%BB%E8%A9%B1
I want to say "it was a rough year", but I'm not sure how to put it. I thought of "難しい年頃" which I understand means "difficult age", normally used to describe the rebel age of kids. How do people normally put it 難しい年 Can we use 大変な年？
If I were to tell my Japanese friend that I plan to become a teacher, would I literally say that I will become a sensei I have always thought of this as an honorific title, and it feels odd to call myself as such. I don't know of any "general" term for teacher. Is there oneThank you.
There are a lot of Japanese words that use the morpheme よ, written 予, to mean "in advance". This clearly looks like a loan from Chinese, but I do not know of any examples of Chinese words or texts that use 予 in such a way. Are there any examples of the usage of 予 to mean "in advance" in Chinese If there are, it must have been a rather rare usage. What would explain the large number of Japanese words that use it in this way
An example would be: "watashi wa cake o(お) tabetai". What does the お doI tried on google translate and it seems it gives pertenence to that thing..like it belongs either to you or me..but I still need actual clarification.
I am reading Genki II. And I found a report sentence (a sentence that states what somebody else said) that ended with と言ってた:チョコレートを食べすぎたって言ってた。  He said he ate too much chocolate.I've got two questions: Why is 食べる in its stem form (食べ) And, why are we using 言ってた instead of 言っていました
I have stumbled upon instances where "は + verb" is used in situations where I thought "を + verb" should be used. For example, recently I've seenその覚悟はしてましたI was prepared for that楽な道は選ぶなdon't choose an easy roadIs there a difference And if there is, what's the "rule" when to use は instead of を
Where do you place the counter in Japanese when you want to specify how many of something there are, especially if you're listing multiple thingsI believe the counter usually goes after the particle associated with the noun:I bought 3 pencils =&gt; 私は鉛筆{えんぴつ}を三本{さんぼん}買{か}いました。But what do you do when there are multiple things you want to count Are these sentences correctI bought two books and three pencils. =&gt; 私は本{ほん}を二冊{にさつ}と鉛筆{えんぴつ}を三本{さんぼん}買{か}いました。 Two books and three pencils are on the desk. =&gt; 本{ほん}が二冊{にさつ}と鉛筆{えんぴつ}が三本{さんぼん}机{つくえ}の上{うえ}にあります。Can you use the の particle to mean the same thing Would it change the meaning or nuance私は二冊{にさつ}の本{ほん}と三本{さんぼん}の鉛筆{えんぴつ}を買{か}いました。
I was doing my daily dose of reading and I came by this particular sentence, which I had a little bit of trouble finding the meaning for.「このあたりからまた意識が虚ろになってしまいました」The context is a patient who had brain surgery and is struggling to get his thoughts together. I roughly translate it to "Once again my consciousness has faded from these effects". The 虚ろに has been the main problem I have with this particular sentence. I know the 虚ろ is a way to address something hollow, or give a sense of emptiness thats different from 空; but I'd like some confirmation on the usage of that 虚ろに in this sentence. Also, the「あたり」is written in hiragana, so I'm not 100% sure on it meaning "effects".Once again, thanks for anyone taking their time to answer this question!
I'm aware that the so-called 'f' in ふ isn't pronounced with the English labiodental fricative [f], but rather the bilabial fricative [ɸ]. I'd like to know if Japanese speakers also use the bilabial fricative to pronounce は, ひ, へ and ほ. The reason I ask is because in romaji, I see these written as 'ha', 'hi', 'fu', 'he', 'ho', and wondered if ふ was a special exception in terms of how it is pronounced.
I saw this message created by a native speaker:「よい夢{ゆめ} を 」.That seemed strange to me. I would have expected: 「よい夢 へ 」.  My thinking right now is that:「よい夢を」 is a straight contraction of 「よい夢をみてください」。 Such a contraction is typical of how to use Japanese in instant messaging. 「よい夢へ」 is something you would say in a conversation. And, it has more of an abstract meaning. A "good dream" is perceived as a destination towards which the speaker is hoping you will advance to.「よい夢ありますように」 is sort of the formal version of 「よい夢へ」。I think that the meaning is like "I hope that you get into the state of having a good dream."Am I correct on any of points 1, 2, or 3
Just saw this picture:Notice the ニッポン.Why is it written in Kana! Isn't that like super bizarre
In my notes I have the following example:私は　仕事を　止めない　つもり　です。  -   I expect my work will not stop. Does anybody know the rule for using つもり Is it just verb plain form e.g.今月　家を買う　つもりです - This month I expect to buy [the] houseSome guidance would be appreciated. Many thanks!EDIT: I've found this example which indicates my notes may be wrong (first example)これから10年働いて、35くらいまで結婚しないつもりだ。  I'm going to work now for 10 years and I won't get married until I'm 35 or something.So have we decided that つもり is to express an intention, rather than an expectation that something will happen If that is so, then how do we say we expect something to happen e.g. "I am expecting to pass the exam"
What are the valid interpretations of the (first) て-form in the following sentence何かを犠牲にして、その上で、平和は成り立っている。I'm having difficulties assigning a definite meaning to this sentence. There seems to be a couple of forms the て-form could imply that all make sense in context (in English at least), which I've listed below. Can any of them be excluded for grammatical reasons 何かを犠牲にした (平和が)何かを犠牲にしている (not平和が)何かを犠牲にしている 何かを犠牲にする　(habitual)The full context is: しかし、平和はただではありません。何かを犠牲にして、その上で、平和は成り立っている。昔は自分の可愛い子供達でした。
I've been trying to understand those two particles when applied to these phrases:私は朝ご飯にお茶を飲みます  私は朝ご飯でお茶を飲みます    私は朝ご飯の時にお茶を飲みます  What I more or less understand is:the only/main thing I have for breakfastat breakfast time, but not at any other timeat breakfast time, but not restricted to that time.So, my questions are:What general function does に fulfill in sentence 1 (specific time, direction...)    Is, in sentence 1, 朝ご飯 functioning as a time expression  In sentence 2,  is 朝ご飯 functioning as a time expression and じ indicating a restrictive period of time
I saw the phrase よいではないか (yoi de wa nai ka) in a comic strip, and decided to look it up because its literal meaning of "isn't it good" didn't seem to make any sense.My research indicated that it was related to something a man says while unwrapping a woman's waist cloth on her kimono (such as in this cheaply made iPhone game), which confused me even more because there was nothing remotely suggesting something that would make one say よいではないか.Can anyone explain the history behind this phrase and its current usage
Can somebody explain the purpose of ぉ character in the end of the following sentenceWhat part of speech can be assigned to ぉ Can the ending の be glued up with ぉアドビにうまいことやられたのぉ。
This question already has answers here:                                            Confusion about “Seemingly not ～”                                (3 answers)                            Closed 6 years ago.I'm playing a video game in Japanese, and one of the characters said僕にもわかりそうにない。I understand that (verb stem)そう means "it seems" or "it appears", but I've never seen (verb stem)そう used with the に particle.My guess is that the sentence means something like:I don't seem to know either.Am I translating it correctly What is the meaning of this construction
I recently wanted to say "The Japanese counting system does not make sense." However, I could not figure out how to communicate the full meaning of "does not make sense". I don't want to say that it is good, bad, difficult, stupid, weird, etc. I want to express the closest approximation to the abstract meaning of "does not make sense". I found "理{り}にかなう" in a dictionary. I've never even heard「理」used all by itself. I've only heard it in words such as  「理屈」 and 「理由」. So, I'm not so sure that that phrase is a natural thing to blurt out in a conversation.Is 「理にかなう」 actually a natural thing to say in daily conversation Does it have the meaning I want  The phrase "makes sense" can be used in many contexts, and most of the time it can be talked around using Japanese I somewhat know. But, in the specific case of "The Japanese counting system does not make sense.", how do you capture the nuance
Could somebody please give me a hint about the meaning of に in 「反抗的な態度に映ったのか、隊長は舌打ちして前を向く。」. If I'm understanding correctly, に here has the same meaning as として.  内容・状態などを示す。「ーとして」の意。「ほうびにもらう」Some sort of translation:Maybe he took it (Luis's laugh) as a rebellious attitude, the captain tutted, facing forward again.With context:隊長「おい、うるさいぞ。ふざけるな」助手席からの苛立たしげな声が、俺たちをぴしゃりと打つ。こちら隊長様だ。瑚太朗「すみません」ルイス「ごめんなさーい」反抗的な態度に映ったのか、隊長は舌打ちして前を向く。
I've never really understood how どうした works and hope someone can explain or point me towards further reading.For example, in my textbook, the following question is asked in relation to a short passage:母親の気持ちに対して、住友君はどうしましたか？The passage describes a young man, Sumitomo-kun, who from about the time he entered elementary school attended juku. The passage explains that because his mother felt the schools you attended were important to succeeding in life she sent him from this age despite thinking at some level that it was too early.The answer to this question seems to be in the following part:「心を鬼にして塾へ送り出してくれた」母親を喜ばせてやろうと、一生懸命勉強し、県下でも有数の公立の進学高校に入学。What I don't understand is why the question used どうした. Could it have used 何をした insteadMore broadly, what are the differences between the two questions
Earlier, I asked a question with the following examples:私は朝飯のみに茶を飲む私は朝飯のみで茶を飲むI was told in a comment that 私 and 朝飯 sound funny together.  Why is that so

I've read a post on this topic, but really not sure of the difference when applied to something like this:私は朝飯のみに茶を飲む  私は朝飯のみで茶を飲むFrom what I read, I'm guessing one of them is incorrect, as に is used for specific times and で　for ranges of time in which an action happened.  So I'm guessing に is the incorrect one.  Could someone confirm me this please
I was having a conversation with a friend of mine who is also learning Japanese, and she used 大きなめんどくさい as a phrase today, which seemed off to me to use 大きい as a modifier on an adjective.  Can you use 大きい/な as an adverb to modify another adjective  If so, are there restrictions around what sort of adjectives it can modify
In English, the term ruby refers to small text set above the main text (in horizontal writing) or to the right of the main text (in vertical writing).  From Wikipedia:Ruby characters (ルビ) are small, annotative glosses that can be placed above or to the right of a Chinese character when writing languages with logographic characters such as Chinese or Japanese to show the pronunciation. Typically called just ruby or rubi, such annotations are used as pronunciation guides for characters that are likely to be unfamiliar to the reader.As I understand it, this is mainly a typography term, and it's likely that many speakers are unfamiliar with it, but web developers probably know the term due to the HTML &lt;ruby&gt; tag.  Students of Japanese are more likely to know furigana than ruby.In Japanese, although ルビ is used, I think that 振{ふ}り仮名{がな} is a much more common word.  Taken literally, 振り仮名 appears to refer specifically to kana, as in hiragana or katakana.  That would make ルビ a more general term, including small kanji or rōmaji used as ruby. In fact, I've seen the term 振{ふ}り漢字{かんじ} used on occasion, in contrast to 振{ふ}り仮名{がな}:kanji printed as ruby, usually to explain kanaMy feeling is that taken strictly, 振{ふ}り仮名{がな} should only refer to kana used as ruby, not to kanji or rōmaji.  But I'm not sure if that reflects actual usage, so I've decided to ask this question:Is it common to use the term 振{ふ}り仮名{がな} for ruby text, even when the characters aren't kana(And if so, would that be considered sloppy usage, or would it be perfectly normal / acceptable)
My dictionary says 今日{きょう} is a special reading. My textbook presents it in the third lesson, so I'm guessing it's a normal pronunciation. So... what's the difference between 今日{こんにち} and 今日{きょう}
I'm really a 初心者 when it comes to Classical Japanese, and I guess that is what I have here...一日の苦労は一日にて足れり.　【聖】Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.Please, can someone tell me what this is about 足れり comes from 足りる or is it from 足るMoreover, I don't get it... Even with the translation, because I'm not an English native speaker either. So can you put the japanese sentence and/or the English translation in a simpler way, please
Why is Typhoon Neoguri sometimes referred to in Japanese as "ノグリー", and not as "ネオグリー"The English language Wikipedia's disambiguation page for Typhoon Neoguri mentions that it used to be referred to in English as "Noguri", but that was back in 2002, and there's been another Typhoon Neoguri between then and now.Is it because Japanese has a commonly used transliteration of the Korean word for "Raccoon dog" (너구리)
Like how it is common to see their/there and "could/would/should of" instead of "could/would/should have" in English discussions.
This is from an exercise in Minna no Nihongo, ch16.Full sentence:神戸は古い物があまりありませんが、町の後ろに山が、前に海があって、素敵な町です。As above, I don't understand why there is nothing after the が. I can sort of see that two sentences have been contracted into one but I'm still lost:Machi no ushiro ni Yama ga aruMachi no mae ni umi ga aru.If someone could help that would be great :)
I've got a question about the two instances of の in 君が代:さざれ石の巌となりて  苔の生すまでFirst, is さざれ石の巌 to be interpreted as a boulder made of pebbles (analogous to, say, 木製の槍)Second, is the の in 苔の生すまで essentially が, akin to the が/の alternation in relative clauses:太郎の焼いた魚 / 太郎が焼いた魚If so, at what stage of the development of Japanese was this alternation possible outside of relative clauses(Bonus: what stage of Japanese does 君が代 even reflect and why I know it was cobbled together in the Meiji period; the Wikipedia article says it's based on a waka from the Heian period, but doesn't provide the original text.)
So here in this sentence below "との" was used 2 times.What does との standfor Can someone please explain it to meこれまで数多くのアニメ作品とのコラボを実現してきた痛印堂には、「好きなアニメとのコラボは嬉しいけど、自分の好きなキャラクターがいない！」「メインキャラクターだけでなく違う子もお願いします！」などの声が届いており、その要望に応えるべく今回の「ガールズ＆パンツァー」痛印第2弾が実現しました。
I have been reading about using と and や.Now, I understand the basic idea that や is for a list where the list is not all-inclusive. と on the other hand essentially informs the listener that "only these things are what I mean."Are there any times where the "and" や and と would both be used in a sentence Specifically for a list of things 趣味がスキーやゴルフや英語と日本語の勉強やカラオケです。 as a possible (and poor) example. If I wanted to say in the example above "My hobbies are skiing, golf, studying English and Japanese, and karaoke."
I'm not really sure there is an equivalent for hypothetical questions in Japanese, but here's hoping there is.In English, hypothetical questions are generally prefaced by "What would you do if..." or something along those lines. It seems like 「何しよう...」 would almost work, but that sounds more like "what could you do if...". To be really specific, how would one say "What would you do if you were dying" or (for the sake of variation) "what would you do if you went to the park"I'm assuming 「公園に行ったならば、何しようか？」 is not correct because it sounds very unnatural.
I already know some things, like 「最初{さいしょ｝の道｛みち｝を右｛みぎ｝に曲｛ま｝がって」 and the like. However, unless one knows the exact moment to shout 「止｛と｝めて！」 then one would need to know how to say things like "it's the third building on the right" or "stop at the building with the sign on it" or something. Those were vague examples, but can someone help me with giving directions, like to a cab driver or a guest
It has always struck me as strange that 買 "buy" and 売 "sell", which are antonyms, have the same on-reading バイ. A few questions:Is there some logic (possibly stemming from the Chinese use of these characters) behind the readings being so similar How are the characters 買 and 売 related Is one derived from the other(This post is inspired by the comments on this answer, which ought to find their way into a proper answer rather than languishing in the comments section.)
I have heard both terms, 年休{ねんきゅう} and 有休{ゆうきゅう} (or occasionally 有給), used to describe paid vacation time, or 年次有給休暇{ねんじゆうきゅうきゅうか}. In my situation it's always been 年休, but I know people just a town over who have insisted that the term is 有休. I have said 年休 to people and they have looked at me confusedly and said 「有休のこと？」Is there any actual difference between these terms, and is there any pattern to when one is used over the other Should I default to 有休
According to the article "On Being Late to Work in Japan | 遅出" (linked from this post at The Workplace):The word for participation – kameseru – has a special significance which also explains why Japanese bureaucracy is so overwhelming...As far as I know, カメセル is not a Japanese word, and it doesn't look like any variations on the vowels (カーメセル or カメーセル or カメセール or カメセルー or some combination thereof) or gemination (カメッセル) give you anything useful either. Nor can I think of any near-homophones (コメセル カメスル) that mean anything related to "participation".What word might the article have meant
The following sentences are from a reading passage. I'm confused on the third sentence - the previous two are just given for context.日本ではどこに行っても、「きまりですから」という言葉を耳にする。 これを言われてしまうと、こちらにはもう反論の余地はない。どんなに常識的で正当な理由もこの言葉にはかなわない。I understand that the meaning is something like "No matter what kind of commonplace or appropriate reasons you give, there's nothing you can do about those words." But there's no verb ("give" in the case of "give a reason"), and it would seem どんなに would only apply if there was some kind of verb (for example, どんなに...理由を挙げても). As it stands, shouldn't it be どんな...理由(で)も What am I missing here
How does one address a stranger in a casual conversation when name is unknownFor example, I had a conversation with an older Japanese lady and I wanted to compliment her on her English (but in Japanese, for some reason). Usually in such situations I might've gone something like ○○さんは英語上手です。 or ○○さんの英語は上手です。　But without the name it is quite difficult for me at this point. Using あなた　feels really rude, neither I'm comfortable relying on zero-pronoun and going 英語は上手です without any context.Should I inquire about person's name in such situations (obviously, not right before I have a sentence to use the name in).
I have a sentence in my book like this:日本が　アメリカによく聞かれて困る質問の一つに、”How are you"　は　日本語で何と言うか、というのがある。and found a similar example here:アメリカでは大学への申込の手続きの一つに「なぜＸ大学に行きたいのか」ということに関してエッセイを書くというのがあります。The part I am confused about is the の一つに... in particular, the に part. Why are we placing a location particle next to 一つ... shouldn't it just be ｘの一つは　（Ｏｎｅ　ｏｆ　ｔｈｅ　Ｘ）
If someone is discussing a situation, and how it is beyond their control, what would be the most natural way to express this  The two options that come to mind offhand are to use either 操る【あやつる】 ("to manipulate") or 支配【しはい】 ("to control"), but I'm not sure which is best in which setting.In the interest of giving the question context, here are a couple attempts at sample sentences:チームはどれほど(orどんなに)好きでも、試合は操ることができない(or試合を操ることはできない)。  "No matter how much I like the team, I can't control the outcome of their matches."明日は晴れれば(or晴れると)いいんだが、天気は支配できない。  "Clear weather tomorrow would be great, but I can't control it."Are those about on the mark, or is there a better way to phrase these kinds of statements
I am trying to remember if the following sentences have the meaning of "it is a custom/habit."(1)「日本では、家に入る前に、靴を脱ぐものです。」(2)「日本業界では、自己紹介をする時に、名刺を交換するものです。」(3)「日本社会において、３月の１４日に、男は女の子にチョコを上げるものです。」  (1) "Taking one's shoes off before entering a house is something they do in Japan."(2) "In a formal business situation in Japan, people always exchange business cards when they do their self-introduction."(3) "In Japan, on March 14, men give chocolate to women."  I am trying to think of how to say "something is a habit". Has anyone seen this grammatical structure (verb+ものです。), or something similar, that has my desired meaning At the least, I am 97% sure I've heard the sentence "家に入る前に、靴を脱ぐものです".
私は大抵七時十五分に起きますWould this be a correct way to say 'I usually get up at 7.15' Not sure 大抵 is correctly placed before the time+に
I noticed that there is this る coming up in 日{ひ}→昼{ひる} and 夜{よ}→夜{よる}. I haven't seen ひる and よる used a lot in Classical Japanese, so ひ and よ probably came first.What is the role of this る Does it have a meaning, or is it simply a homophone-avoiding filler like 田-んぼ and 葉-っぱ Is it by any chance related to 雲/曇る和訳{{pad}}「日{ひ}→昼{ひる}」と「夜{よ}→夜{よる}」にはどちらも「る」が入っていることに気づきました。「ひる」も「よる」も文語ではあんまり見ないので、たぶん「ひ」と「よ」が元の形だと思います。{{pad}}この「る」はどういう役割なんですか？意味があるのか、それとも「田んぼ」や「葉っぱ」のように、ただの同音異義語を避けるための語尾でしょうか？もしかして「雲{くも}→曇る{くもる}」の仲間ですか？
For instance, if I say the following as the first phrase in a conversation:おはよう！ピクニックでリナさんを探していましたが、どこもみえませんでしたね。Hi! I was looking for you at the picnic, but couldn't find anywhere.Is it OK to construct the sentence without a particular topic Is I as the topic implied in this case
I have come across this sentence:一九七０年頃までは、どこでも銭湯がありましたが、今は、少なくなりました。Why does it say どこでも X がある instead of どこにも X があるI understand that で and に are very similar as they have ties in the past, but I just don't understand the difference in meaning here.
Even when I think I've memorized how to read a particular kanji, 人 (ひと) for example, and try to read other words I find that it's also pronounced じん...and I'm sure it probably has many other readings.Should readings just be taken on a case-by-case basis / word-by-word basis Is there any point to memorizing a single kanji reading and applying it else where or is there some structure to when each reading is used
I was watching an episode of One Piece, and while studying the transcript, I came across this sentence.ルフィに　会いてえんなら俺が　教えてやるよAce told the other pirates "If ya wanna meet Luffy, I'll tell ya where he is". In the word 会いてえん, what does the えん　part mean Is it some sort of grammar construct Is it commonly used in colloquial Japanese Thanks guys!

As above. This sentence came up in my test:今日は曇りで、寒かったです。and I was a bit puzzled why it wasn't kumokkute (I  translated it as cloudy = adj) until I looked it up on Jisho.com. But I'm still confused by this concept so I'm looking for examples of nouns like this so I can understand it better and know which nouns I should be aware of, if there are any. Unless this noun is an exception. Please list any common ones if you can think of any,Thank you!
In my textbook it says you can use the 読みます form to talk about habitual actions, such as私はよく本を読みますBut I read on the internet (source) that the correct form for this is 読んで and the sentence should be私はよく本を読んでIs my textbook wrong
I finished Core 10000 (an Anki deck) and 振る舞う (to entertain) was one of the last ones to pop up.I find it interesting because to me it appears to be a combination of plain form 振る (to shake) + another plain form verb 舞う (to dance). This differs from all the other two-verb compounds I am used to such as 取り引き (transaction, noun in this case)、書き直す (rewrite)、やり直す (redo)、吹き出す (blow out), 話し出す (start talking)、飛び上がる (fly up), where the first verb is the masu-form instead of plain.I cannot recall any similar plain-form + plain-form verbs like 振る舞う.My theory is that either this verb is an exception to the rule or this verb is in fact, NOT a two-verb compound. It is simply ふるまう, a single verb, and the Kanji was conveniently added later to make it look like a two-Kanji compound.
completely stuck on this kanji. recognized lower part, but not the top.よろしくお願いします！
What does v-た+であろう mean  For example:ほんの一、ニ分のやりとりであったであろうが、いかに屈託のない若い人たちの闊達さがさわやかであった。Does it mean something is likely to be that way But what then if it appears that this thing has already happened
うちに has two rather confusingly different meanings. One is in line with its never seen kanji form. Whilst. Do x whilst y.Another means do x before y's situation changes. The two are quite different as to when x should be done. Is there a way to spot which is meant
What does 玉ヒュン meanIt seems to have something to do with not experiencing fear of heights.Context (posted on social media with a picture taken vertiginous height):女だけど玉ヒュン！
I'm reading a manga, and in it one of the characters uses grammar that I've never seen before. The sentence is as follows:小姓さんが見当たりませぬな。是非お会いしたかったのですが。I understand pretty much everything else in the sentence:[小姓]{こしょう}さん = page見当たる = find是非 = certainlyお会いしたかった = (humbly) wanted to meetBut because of this conjugation that I'm not familiar with, I'm not sure how it all fits together. What does +ませぬな mean
What does のでは mean in the following sentence  What changes if we write this sentence like this - デカイ腹に集中した、というのが こいつは大らかというか・・・・・・いつも寝てばかりいる印象がある。ってかいつも寝てる。寝過ぎで余った栄養が全部そのデカイ腹に集中したのでは、というのが、クラスに於ける男子たちの共通見解だ。All of the excessive nutritions appeared because of the oversleeping, are gathering in his stomach, it's the opinion of boys in our class.I think the meaning is different from the sentence below.夏中エアコンのきいた室内にいたのでは、日焼けするはずがない。 You can't get a tan by staying in an air-conditioned room through summer.
In my JLPT textbook, I have a short letter in business Japanese, which is where I'm definitely weakest.The letter is from 山口商事 to 森山工業, and here it is as it appears in the book. Sorry for all my markings. I hope it's readable:Here is what I think is the relevant part of the letter:当社は、上記上田物産株式会社に対し、金100万円の債権を所有しておりますが、同社はその後倒産し、貴社に対しても売掛金の支払いを催促した様子は見られません。つきましては、上記債務を当社にお支払いいただきたく、ご通知いたします。The question about the letter is  この文書は何を要求しているか。　And the given answer is, 山口商事が森山工業に100万円支払うこと. My understanding from that answer is that the topic of the letter is the Yamaguchi company paying a million yen to the Moriyama construction company.What I can't figure out, though, is if the Yamaguchi company intends to pay that money. The part where it says 売掛金の支払いを催促した様子は見られません makes me think that they're saying they don't think they have to pay. They "can't see any indication of their obligation to pay", or something like that.However, the 上記債務を当社にお支払いいただきたく、ご通知いたします part makes me think that maybe they do intend to pay. Actually, it's very confusing to me, because I thought いただく meant to receive, so do they expect to receive payment of some kindWhere am I getting tangled up in all this formal business language, and can anyone help me untangle it
I have been attempting to translate a song to improve my Japanese, but I came across a phrase that has me very confused. The phrase is 「腐っていく」。 It seems to be some sort of sexual pun Any help with understanding this phrase would be much appreciated. If you could go in-depth with your explanation, that would be even more appreciated!
What is the difference between 区別{くべつ} and 差別{さべつ}  I looked them up in my Japanese to Chinese dictionary, but the dictionary defines them to be "difference", to put it literally.
I guess there is a slight/subtle difference between the two, but also wondering what is the preferred/acceptable way to express this to someone who is a good friend (not just an acquaintance). Ideally it should show some concern but without being forceful or commanding.
In a novel I'm reading (「キッチン」 by 吉本{よしもと}ばなな), there's this situation where the door opens and a woman enters the room asking for the main character by name. The main character, being surprised and not knowing the woman, asks her who she is:失礼ですが、どちら様でしたか？My question is: why the past form of です is used in 「どちら様でしたか？」 Those two people are standing there talking to each other, so why the past form Would it be possible to ask 「どちら様ですか？」

I wonder how to say something likeNow I'm reading about ways to get to Kyoto from Tokyo.I know the necessary words but I wonder how to say this "about". Will it be okay if I just write this今、東京から京都まで行く方法について読んでいます
I have this Japanese sentence from a novel:それだけでも町が盛況になるのに十分な上に、スラウド川には橋がないせいで自然と人は渡し舟の多いこの町を通ることになるのだ。Which from my trial (but I really get the feeling it is wrongly translated) I translate to:Even with just this, the village can amply prosper, since because the Slaude river has no bridge, both the nature and the people become the ferry of the village.The part which makes me more unsure would be 自然と人は渡し舟の多いこの町を通ることになるのだ。 Does it mean that nature and people are something together, like acting as metaphorical ferries
I was told today that the grass radical, e.g. the top of 花 has a gap in the middle of it, and googling it suggests that it is sometime written like this. Is that strictly in Chinese, is it sloppy, or is it just another way of writing Is the correct way leaving it connected
I was just thinking about the sunburn I will get during the upcoming 4th of July holiday. Then, I wondered if 「日焼{ひや}け」is a verb nominalization. If it is, I am not aware of such a pattern.Is it an ad-hoc conglomeration of the idea of "sun", "skin", and "burn"「日は人間の肌を焼ける」「日は焼ける」// make the object implicit「日焼ける」// drop the article「日焼け」// drop the trailing "る"Or, is this representative of a certain verb nominalization process that can be used to nominalize other verbs
I haven't seen this very often at all, so this has got me stumped.Here's an example with it showing up frequently:http://www.orenoh.com/knowledge/mensetu-shikaku.htmlThe title, for example:"未経験者を面接をする側の気持ちを考えてみる"How do you translate this sentence, and how would you read 側 when it's used like this
I'm looking through JLPT N3 questions and have come across this one:A: ねえ　（　　　）　どんなひと？  B: とても親切でいい人だよThe possible answers are:田中さんが 田中さんで 田中さんって 田中さんでも Number 4 makes no sense at all. "Tanaka-san but"Number 2 is a bit weird. We're not doing anything with Tanaka. It is wrong.However, my instinct was that number 1 was correct. It is not. 3 is.I understand the use of って。 Its saying on the subject of whatever-&gt;this.But が also seems that it would work fine. Tanaka is the object we're talking about.Why is 1 so wrong and 3 has to be rightAlso, would は be strictly okay in this sentence

I heard from an English man that the katsu karē (カツカレー) dish was from English inspiration originally: he told me that the word 'katsu' is coming from cutlet and 'karē' would be curry.Please can anyone confirm this
The context is : some people are acting stupidly, and someone else  watching them says this : 困ったものです。こういう連中には...My first thought was to translate the sentence in the following way :That kind of guys are annoying.With the idea that the speaker is annoyed BY (に) the group and that it's a personal feeling (ものだ).But the translation I have roughly says :"That kind of guys should be ashamed."   I know that ものだ can have a meaning close to べきだ, like if we were expecting the action to take place, which would fit with the translation I have. But then I would expect the sentence to end with 連中は and not 連中には for the group to be the subject... Unless there can be a construction of 困る with に, other than "be embarrased by something..." that I'm not aware of...So, which に/ものだ is itThanks.
Here is the sentence from ドラゴンボール,  :全世界注目の地球の運命を賭けたセルゲームが始まろうとしています。(the Cell Game is a martials arts tournament for those who don't know the manga)I'm not sure of what the first の means here :Is it the の equivalent to が in subordinate clauses But then I don't really get why 注目 would be used :The Cell Game, on which the (attention of the) entire world stakes the future of the earth, is about to begin.My guess is it's the same の as in :兄のジョンだ。 This is John, my brother.Then a translation would be :The Cell game, center of the entire world's attention, and on which we bet the destiny of the earth, is about to begin.Or is it something elseThanks for your time.
I see this often in business emails, I guess it is not very important in terms of meaning but I couldn't find any post on stackexchange about it.What does とのことです add to a sentence Here is the latest example I've read:碑文谷警察署の本町二丁目交番とのことです
Currently I'm learning Japanese by discovering vocabulary and new grammars which I can find in Japanese Windows XP. I have some trouble understanding these grammar elements in the following examples : ファイルを保存 (Fairu wo hozon)保存するファイル (Hozon suru fairu)Google translate says their meanings are "Save the file" and "The file to be saved" respectively. However, I'd like to know which type of grammar are they using. Could you please explain it in detail and give me some similar examples
I would really appreciate your help. I just read the sentenceまたひるめしをくいはぐったand I can't quite figure out what はぐった means and what the basic grammar of this conjugation is. I'm kinda lost...
I am trying to understand how the plain form is used in novels set in the past through the explanations in the paper referenced below. I wonder if someone could explain how we should understand the Japanese version of the following examples: Example 24: (1) 広田さんは髭の下から歯を出して笑った。    (2) わりあいきれいな歯を持っている／持っていた。  (1) hirota-san wa hige no sita kara ha o dasite warat-TA.    (2) wariai kireina ha o motte-i-RU/motte-i-TA. (1) Mr. Hirota SMILED showing his teeth below his moustache.    (2) He’D GOT good-looking teeth. Example 25:　　(1) 「お出になりませんか」と聞くと、先生は少し笑いながら、無言のまま首を横に振った。    (2) 子どものような所作をする/した。  (1) “odeni narimasen ka” to kiku to, sensei wa sukosi warai nagara, mugon no mama kubi o yoko ni hut-TA.    (2) kodomo no yoona syosa o su-RU/si-TA. (1) “Wouldn’t you like to go out” asked Sanshiro, and then Sensei smiled faintly and SHOOK his head without saying a word.    (2) That WAS a childlike gesture.Example 29: (1) 「おしだ。」と信吾はつぶやいた。    (2) ぎゃあっと言った蝉とはちがう。  (1) “osida,” to singo wa tubuyai-TA.    (2) gyatto itta semi to wa tiga-U.(1) “This one’s mute,” Shingo MUTTERED.    (2) It WAS different from the one that had sung so loudly.My limited understanding is that:ta-form are main sentences about the foreground, plain form are about the background.   In each case the English translation places the plain form sentence in the past tense and makes it part of the author's narrative but, as the paper explains, this is wrong. You lose the perspective of being there, conveyed by the plain form.   In sentence 2 of example 24 the past tense does not work, but I am not sure why. Again in example 2 of example 25 past tense does not work, but I am not sure why.  Sanshiro seems to be "thinking" sentence 2 of example 25 but I am not really sure.  English translations do always help. Sometimes they feel unnatural. For example, in the second sentence of "Example 25", I am not sure why the author has used "That" instead of "It". "It" (as used in sentence 2 of "Example 29") would have been more natural if the sentence was written from the author's perspective. "That" would fit if sentence was from Sanshiro's perspective, but if it his unspoken observation or the narrative has switched, how are we supposed to tell, what is the convention There is a bit more to it than just: background, plain form = time of utterance.   In example 29 we are told that sentence two is the "voice" of Shingo's: Are these his actual thoughts or observations, or even just what he could observe I am confused. My guess is that:Possibly this writing can be likened to the frames in a US-Comic book() where:- The authors narrative appears in the rectangular boxes,- the ta-form sentences represent the words appearing in speech bubbles- The plain form sentences refer to the images/pictures and the thoughts appearing in the "thought bubbles"      But, I don't really know if this works.  I have struggled with explanations in the paper (link below) but if somebody could explain in simple terms how to interpret the plain form sentences above I should be grateful.

I'm not sure how to translate the word シレジレ.Does it mean something like "perky, confident, opinionated, presumptuous"If so, may シレジレメカコラム be translated as "All-knowing Mecha Column" or "Wise Guy's Mecha Column"
According to what I read, となる is the written counterpart of になる. Nevertheless, I stumbled upon some use of となる that seems not to fall under the typical usage of になる (which, for me, means "to become" as in 講師になった).Sometimes となる seems to be used in place of the copula です. (Ex: 考{かんが}えを述{の}べる表現は「〜と思う。」となる)Another use that I do not understand can be found in this example:  動詞は、述語 となる 三つの品詞の中で最も変化に富むもので、その文型もさまざまな種類があり ますが、動詞文の最も基本的な型は、次のように表すことができます。  in paragraph 1.1.3 動詞文 of 基本述語型と修飾語 Thus, my question is what do mean those usages of となる And is there any other usage of となる
I'm puzzling over these kanji...And this. Is it 数, right Then, it might be translated as "several meters"
I looked up ありがたい in my dictionaries within OSX (looking at this question), and one of the 国語 dictionaries (can't tell which) has the entry listed like this:ありがた・い　【有り難い・難有い】You'll notice that the kanji in the second representation have swapped order.  Is/was this an accepted spelling for ありがたい, or is this likely just a typo in this dictionary
Can you help me pleaseI can't recognize this kanji with red arrow
I am having trouble with thinking of usage cases for 「ありがたい」.   The usage case of ありがた迷惑 does not make sense to me. Even though I don't know that particular phrase, I can use it as a template. Therefore, I would expect all of the following to also be correct：ありがたい案内者ありがたい説明ありがたいお土産ありがたいオゴリ....But none of those sound correct to me. I've only heard 「ありがたい」 used as a substitute for 「ありがとう」 in an informal situation. However, 「ありがとう」seems a little different because it seems to bring a complete end to a thought, while「ありがたい」might be followed by a conjunction such as 「ありがたいけれど...」、「ありがたいでも...」What are some examples of how to use「ありがたい」、as well as examples of how to use it in an inflected form
As part of a long text on the use of られる, there is this sentence:られる　は私{わたし}の父{ちち}が信{しん}じていたほどには効能{こうのう}を持{も}っていなかったのではなかろうか。This sentence is from my JLPT textbook, but it seems a section of the full text can be found online here.)I'm having trouble parsing this sentence. My inadequate attempt to translate it has only resulted in fragments that don't come together into one logical whole. "As for られる / to the degree my father put trust in / didn't have benefit / probably wasn't the case."Can someone help me link everything together so that this sentence makes sense
Sorry, I am new at learning Japanese and I am trying my best to figure things out from word-by-word translations... but sometimes it's hard to piece together with just the internet.I was reading a blog wherein this guy drew a new character. This is what he wrote under it:以外にカワイイかもラブラブ 自分の人生なんていうもんに使ってるんだ...(;´д｀)ﾄﾎﾎ…I am not entirely sure what the second sentence really meansWhat does "mon" mean And I sort of get the first sentence, saying that it's other than 'kawaii' but what does kamo mean is it short for somethingThank you for your help in advance!
The word 生後 means something like "after birth".  明鏡国語辞典 defines it this way:生まれてから以後。But 生前 doesn't mean "before birth".  Instead, it means something like "before death; while [someone] was still alive".  From 明鏡 again:その人がまだ生きていたとき。死ぬ前。存命中。In fact, 広辞苑 explicitly says it's the opposite of 死後, not of 生後.  I find this a bit counterintuitive!  Is there a reason why people say 生前 with this meaning instead of something like 死前  Is there a way to understand it intuitively, or some sort of etymology that makes it make sense  My dictionaries don't explain why 生 + 前 has the meaning 死ぬ前.Or is it one of those things I should just memorize, perhaps
The following sentence/phrase comes from the Progressive (プログレッシブ）dictionary:この本は自然主義について論じている｜This book deals with naturalismIn English people often say something like "This books addresses the issue of...." or even "This book discusses...." instead of "In this book the author deals with....".  Is it possible to use verbs such as 論じる (to discuss) in the same way in JapaneseAlthough the topic of  this sentence is clear, I am not sure whether the subject  is the book or the author (who is not mentioned).  If the sentence was rewritten to make the subject clear would it be:著者がこの本で自然主義について論じているOr is the following possible:この本が自然主義について論じているOr are both possible(I can't tell from the entry for 論じる in my other dictionary (大辞泉) and I am not 100% sure the locational particle is required with は (it is for example optional in the sentence 彼[に]は英語ができない), or whether it would be で or に.)
I have a question with the follow sentence:田中さんはビデオゲームに遊んでいますIs the particle に okay
I've asked about 澤 before here on Stack Exchange, but have a follow up question: Is 沢 the modern replacement for 澤 Is 澤 deprecated by the Ministry that decides such matters
As part of a larger block of text, my JLPT textbook has this sentence:私{わたし}たちは、コトバに対{たい}して一種{いっしゅ}のぬぐいがたい軽視{けいし}、軽{かる}く見{み}る傾向{けいこう}が一般{いっぱん}にあるといっていいかもしれません。I'm specifically confused about the コトバに対{たい}して一種{いっしゅ}のぬぐいがたい軽視{けいし} part.First, I think the ぬぐい in ぬぐいがたい is from 拭{ぬぐ}う, as in, "to wipe away" or "to eliminate". So, it's something like "when facing words we eliminate one type"...For the whole sentence, it comes across to me as something like, "All of us, when facing words it's easy to eliminate one type with contempt, maybe you could say we generally tend to look at them lightly." Which doesn't really add up to something sensible. I went with "contempt" for 軽視{けいし}, though other definitions are "disdain" or "make light of", but no matter how I translate it, I can't see how it fits.One type of what One type of words Why would we wipe them awayWhat exactly does this sentence mean
One of the common mistakes that Japanese people make when speaking in English is to translate the expression "電話番号を教えて" directly into English - "to teach a phone number", which can confuse native English speakers who are not familiar with the expression. I was wondering why they use the word teach rather than a verb similar to tell or give
結ぶ means to connect, tie, or bind things together, either physically or metaphorically.  And then it has the seemingly random phrase [実]{み}を結ぶ meaning "to bear fruit".  How does this meaning derive from the "tie/bind" meaning of 結ぶ and the 結 character in general
I cannot understand what exactly is ように modifying in the following sentence. And is it grammatically possible for 流れる濁流のよう to modify 急激な感情の Because in phrase like this - 完璧に思ったとおりの仕上がり, 完璧に modifies  思ったとおりの. It is the question I've asked some time ago. But in this sentence it's also 急激な which modifies 感情, so I'm not sure if it's correct. 一人残された俺は考えを巡らせている。どうしようもなく流れる濁流のように急激な感情の波を止められずにいる。
I've heard about 田舎, or more likely the English word "inaka" derived from the Japanese word, being used in a pejorative way by assistant English teachers:Inaka (田舎 inaka) is a Japanese term meaning a rural area or the  countryside. When said by people on the JET Programme, it is often  used as a pejorative about places outside the major metropolitan  areas, highlighting the lack desirable urban features - bars, shops,  general entertainment, young people etc.However, is it commonly a derogatory term in JapaneseI recently came across the following in a homework exercise私のいなかは空気がきれいです。Which I assume when properly kanji-ized would be 私の田舎は空気がきれいです。I looked up いなか on jisho.org, and it warned that 田舎 can be a sensitive word:(Sensitive) rural area; countryside; the sticks;and some of the word compounds involving いなか were derogatory. For example:田舎っぺNoun, Vulgar expression or word   hick; country bumpkin; yokelIs "田舎" a derogatory term Does it depend on context If so, in what contexts is it derogatory, and in what contexts is it not derogatory
I have seen a documentary about a mangaka who would draw her own manga from start to finish and the documentary described that she was applying a Japanese principle of doing things alone, at your own pace, from start to finish. It was described as a principle of responsibility and integrity and it was contrasted to the way in western productions usually creating something is done by several people with different skills, whereas in Japan when you do everything yourself, your spirit is reflected throughout your work and has therefore more soul and harmony.The documentary described this principle as a principle of integrity, of responsibility, a person should take responsibility and work through things on their own. The mangaka kept saying she wanted to be a person of integrity because of this principle. The principle in Japanese sounded like "Suji yo konsu" meaning a person who is consistent, but since I don't speak Japanese at all (I only begin), I can't find which principle it is. Do you know which principle it is and how to write it in romaji I have looked in Google I can't find any information on the documentary or on this principle. I would really like to learn more about this principle if only I knew how it is called in Japan. Thanks.  --An answer from a Japanese speaker who will recognize this principle and give the word or phrase that describes this principle even if it doesn't sound like what I think I have heard is also acceptable. I suspect it is something the Japanese know and live by so maybe there is a common word for it and I might have misheard. My interest is to know more about this principle of responsibility/integrity/own path/consistency to do something alone from start to finish. From the documentary there is a strong emphasis in doing things alone in this principle.
What does the じゃもの in 春じゃもの mean The phrase is a koto song title, so I can't give much context. I think my teacher said it meant something like "clearly", or "the essence of". But I can't remember, and I was wondering if the じゃ was では and if the mono was 物.
I noticed on my trip to Japan that tour guides in museums etc use a very interesting type of language. It seems to be used almost exclusively by people in Osaka and Kyoto.There are two features that stand out to me: the first one is that 〜ます seems to be used attributively very often. People say things like ここにありますもの and 〜ますので, while IIRC in standard Japanese ます does not have a 連体形. Forms like 〜まして, 〜ましょうと〜ます are also very commonly used, while supplantion by plain form is supposedly correct. Secondly, people use けれども a lot and almost never use けれど or けど. This is not really "wrong", but I personally have never ever seen けれども in print. Obviously ど can be followed by も ever since Old Japanese, but 〜ども seems to be quite rare in Modern Japanese. Also, a weird invalid accent pattern seems to be used: けれども{LLLH}.What is this type of 丁寧語 language Is it a variant of 標準語 from Kansai area I am sure that in situations where correct language is more mandated, like newscasting and text-to-speech train station announcements, this kind of "overgeneralized 丁寧語" is not used.
I saw this link - When is the correct situation to use 案外 or 意外It taught me a new word （案外） and explained its difference from 意外 well.But it's other words that have me confused.意外 and 驚くべき. Both mean surprising. When would each be used What is the difference in meaningAlso ブクリシタ (not sure how to spell it) - I'm told this is only used in spoken Japanese and never in written Japanese... is it dialect Seems unusual that it would be never written at all. How does this one enter the mix
A sentence from JapanesePod101.私たちは、離陸するまで二時間、飛行機の中で座っていた。  We sat on the airplane for two hours before it took off.The general meaning of the sentence is not in question, but is 離陸するまで modifying 座っていた or 二時間 (i.e. the two hours until the plane departed) My instincts say it's the former, but that comma is throwing me off.
というわけで、俺は実家で只今大絶賛ひとり暮らし中である。From what I can tell, the speaker is saying that for reasons mentioned he is living alone at home, but I don't see how 大絶賛 (which means very high praise) affects the meaning of the sentence. The meaning "high praise" seems to not fit in at all with the rest of the sentence or context. The word can be used in either noun form or suru-verb form, so its usage and placement has left me baffled. Is there perhaps some omission or something in play
I'm translating an interview with a manga artist, and there's a part that I don't understand. He's talking about the violence in his manga.作家：　作家は思った以上にフィクションと現実を分けてますから。そこに描かれたことは別に俺の願望でもなければ、そういうやり方を世の中に示唆したつもりもないんですけど。話のために、いたいけなことをさせてしまったというのもあるので。編集者：　そうですよね。今回の主人公もやはりいたいけな目にあうんでしょうか？I don't understand the "いたいけなことをさせてしまったというのもあるので" bit. What might いたいけなこと mean in this context
Probably a very simple question for those more familiar with Japanese language.How この間 are usually pronounced Dictionary gives both このかん and このあいだ, I was wondering which one is most likely to be used in modern language, and is there any significant difference in meaning between pronunciations
I was translating some lines and I'm not quite sure the best way to go through this one, specifically the もらおう bit:君の妄言もいい加減にしてもらおう！Now, I'm aware of the usage of ～てもらう but what would be the best way to bring the volitional form to English Keep in mind that the speaker is actively hostile to the listener, so I'm stuck between two ways of reading this: a more direct translation ("I will have you cease your inane rambling!") and one that keeps the intent but is more active ("I will put an end to your inane rambling!").Are both versions acceptable or is only one incorrect Or, even, are neither correctEither way, thanks for the help.
In English we have a lot of very specific words for many animals. Male foxes are known as reynards or tods, female foxes are known as vixens, and baby foxes are known as kits.It's not an isolated instance either. Bucks, does, and fawns. Bulls, cows or heifers, and calfs.It's not even isolated by class. Roosters, hens, and chicks.Does Japanese have this sort of word specificity, is there an affix of some sort, or are you forced to spell it out, so to speak, as when saying "young fox" or "baby fox".I am specifically looking for what to call a "kit" or baby fox, since the closest translation I can find is キット which is obviously a loan word and doesn't even necessarily mean a fox kit but it would be good to know what to do in the future.
Good day!I've seen some emails ending with 何卒宜しくお願い致します but I was wondering if it just raises the respect/politeness of a letter or does it have specific situations where it should/shouldn't be useLike when you're expecting a response, I usually end with ご回答の程、宜しくお願いします。 But I'm really not that clear with 何卒 usage.Thanks!
Enno Shioji's answer to my question about 直音表記 says (emphasis added) that:Historically there were multiple way to write a word, and this wasn't standardized. For example, some very old documents contain both 直音表記 and ヤ行表記.This was subsequently standardized as 歴史的仮名遣い and then 現代仮名遣い.When did this happen, and how I imagine that at the time (whenever that was), there was no body analogous to the various ones that have been involved in the standardization of the modern language (e.g. the switch from 旧字体 to 新字体; the promulgation of the 常用漢字 list; standardization of 現代仮名遣い, etc.), so this must have been a more organic process.
I'm studying for the N1.  And there are several not so often used structures that you really need to know the minute differences between.  One of these is the uses of 至る.  As far as I know, these are the structures that I am familiar with:に至って - once it reached the very point of X, at this extreme Xに至っても - even up to this very point of Xに至っては - given this extreme example, this is the situationに至る - all the way to X, leading to X, more emphatic than までに至るまで　- as far as X, up until XAm I missing any other uses or nuancesThis seems like the kind of question that should have been asked before, but I couldn't find it any searches. Sorry if this is a repeat.
I know it's very basic but I am a beginner... If anybody could be of any help it would be fantastic :)I know how to ask about closing and opening time (of shops, offices etc) but I don't know how to answer if for example the closing and opening time is different during weekend or on a specific day.Thank you for your help :)
According to Wikipedia, it would be "舒适区" IN CHINESE- I would like to know if this is valid and recognizable in Japanese, too, or if there are more specific/nuanced terms to convey the same idea in Japanese.Some examples of the meaning I am looking for, taken from Google definition of the term:Comfort zone - nouna situation where one feels safe or at ease."the trip is an attempt to take the students out of their comfort zone"a settled method of working that requires little effort and yields only barely acceptable results."if you stay within your comfort zone you will never improve"Finally, Google Translate gives you "安全地帯" for it.

We all learn early on that hamburger can be translated into Japanese in two different ways:ハンバーガー meat patty in a bunハンバーグ just the meat patty (or salisbury steak to be exact)Likewise launder has been borrowed twice into Japanese, with two different pronunciations:コインランドリー laundromatマネー・ロンダリング money launderingNotice the ランド／ロンダ distinction.(Actually, the laundry example isn't "perfect", because laundry and laundering aren't really the same word. But it still amused me when I noticed it.)Can anyone think of more examplesEDITNot Chinese words, please. That would be too easy!! I prefer words that are rendered in katakana.
A Japanese teacher on Twitter posted that 化学 is pronounced かがく and means "chemistry".  I double-checked it on tangorin.com and it lists that pronunciation but says that it's pronounced ばけがく to avoid confusion with 科学 ("science").I can't find any more info on the net about this... could somebody confirm thisIn particular, for my Anki vocabulary deck, which pronunciation should I learn  Or should I shoehorn both into my deck somehow

Could someone help me translate this２２歳でこんなことも思い出せない。。。あせる  これから気が遠いよI think the first sentence is something about being 22 years old and not remembering well. As for the second sentence, I can only make out "from now on, feel far" ().  I am not sure how the second sentence relates to the first one.
Context: 15-year boy speaking to himself  あの子とも 違う秘密を持ったみたいで後ろめたい気分だI brought this long phrase here because I have several points of doubt in it.First: あの子とも doesn't seem to be the same as here or here. I suspect it is just an emphasis (like: "That kid!!"), but I would like someones confirmation, just to be sure.Second: 違う秘密 Another secret, rightThird: 持ったみたい Now, this one I really have no idea :) Is it even parsed like that Like "Motta Mitai" being something on its own...Last: 後ろめたい気分だ Ok, he's feeling guilty.So, can someone provide explanation for these parts (specially the first and third) A full translation would also be desirable, to see how these things connect.
Anybody who has visited a Japanese city will have noticed that peculiar type of advertising not common elsewhere.Packets of tissues containing some promotional offer or even quite like a calling card are ubiquitous. Is there a special term for them
I looked up 釈迦 at goo辞書 and noticed that there were two alternate readings presented for this word: さか and しゃか. The さか reading is given as being 『「しゃか」の直音表記。』, so these two are clearly the same lexical item, just with different kana representations. I then looked up 直音 and found that this term basically refers to any mora that can be written using a single kana - so it includes あ・き・す・て・の but excludes きゃ・しゅ・ちょ, as well as non-standard two-kana morae like グァ. One can respell 拗音 (i.e. non-直音) as 直音 by "removing" the middle phone, e.g. /sha/ → /sa/, /myu/ → /mu/, etc.So I understand what 直音 are, but I do not know why one would choose to take a perfectly good word like しゃか and then rewrite it using only 直音 so that you get さか. When, historically, did people prefer 直音表記 and why Are there some types of words where the use of 直音表記 is particularly common, e.g. Buddhist terminology
The book says use ～ている for a) an action in progress and b) a past event that is connected with the present, and it has examples like スーさんは本を読んでいます, and all the examples are using ています. But when I look it up in the dictionary, it says その本なら読んでいるよ. So when do I use ～ている and when do I use ～ています

To describe the context...Girl A and a boy arrange to go to an amusement park to find some clues about...something. Or that's what she says to him, but the girl is actually tricking the boy into going on a date with her. With this in mind, the boy then goes to girl B and asks her to come to the amusement park as well, thinking that she might help. He doesn't explain the situation, so girl B thinks that he is asking her out on a date. They all meet at the amusement park and the girls get upset because there are 3 people when there should only be 2 and they don't want to talk anymore. The boy goes to buy some juice.So now, girl B complains to the other girl: あいつはクズよ！！今日だってもう少し説明しろってのよ！！At the same time, the boy, now alone, talks to himself: 早く家に帰ってゲームしたいのに・・・さっさと話し合いしろってんだ。To me it feels like the sentences would translate as "He is garbage!! Today too, I mean, explain a little more, damn it!!" and "Even though I want to get back home sooner and play games...I mean, get talking already." So then, is the subject of ってんだ the speakerSomeone told me that it's actually similar to というのは but I don't understand how it is possible when the imperative is used.
From Jim Breen's EDICT:ワールドカップ,   ダブルはい  【Ｗ杯】What is most commonly usedIs W ever pronounced the same as 'W' in English and not ダブルWill people ever say:ダブルカップワールドはいI know everyone keeps refering to:Pronunciation of Wbut that still doesnt answer my question if people ever just use the pronunciation of English 'W' to say Japanese 'W' - I mean there is a clear difference between W and ダブル.
As stated in the topic, what does 死者は何も語らない mean, maybe as an idiomThe phrase is from a sentence in a novel, the speaker being a woman talking to a girl. As a background, the girl is getting revenge on the woman, who killed the girl's family and friends.「…死者は何も語らぬ。妾も、貴様も、結局は私怨で、不条理な現実に対し自らが納得のいく結果を求めたに過ぎぬ。そんな妾と貴様の間に、どれ程の違いがあるというのだろうか、とな」
For this sentence, "保存をお忘れなくですぞ！”　I am guessing the word "naku" is a suffix meaning not So then it'd be saying, "do not forget to save!" And is the "o" before "wasure" there to make it more polite
(Preface: I'm not well-versed in language acquisition, so the context I've provided here will be dumbed-down, or perhaps just dumb.)Context: When children acquire their first language, they typically go through a phase where they take grammatical rules (e.g. "form past tense by adding -ed to a verb") and apply them in situations where they aren't applicable (e.g. using *goed as the past tense of go). This is called overgeneralization. Children acquiring English as a first language overgeneralize verb conjugations all over the place - "I ated the candy", "She telled me to do it", etc.Since Japanese has fewer irregular conjugations than English, I expect overgeneralization (in the context of conjugation) to be less visible, but I doubt that it is absent altogether. I have, for example, heard *iikunai as the overgeneralized negative of ii "good" in place of yokunai. (Albeit this was a child character in an anime, not a real child, so this may not be representative.)Question: Do children make similar errors with irregular verbs and other conjugatable words For example, might they use *shiru as the 終止形 of suru "to do" or *kinai as the negative of kuru "to come" What about with irregular honorifics like irassharu, gozaru (I guess children wouldn't use these as much, since keigo is mastered relatively late...)I would also be interested in cases where children incorrectly treat non-conjugatable words as conjugatable, e.g. (to use some examples from the comments), *ippakunai as the negative of ippai "a lot; much" or *kireikunai as the negative of kirei "pretty".
Can anyone explain to me why 準備が出来ている means "It's ready" I don't think I know exactly what 出来ます means, as we initially learned it as "able to"- but I've seen other uses like in saying "I have/got a girlfriend," or "There is a library." (At least, I think the latter, like 図書館が出来た." In any event, I know 準備 is preparation, so the real question is what does 出来ている mean, and why does it mean that
Skimming through the options my IME presents for とる, I'm seeing a whole lot of choices, including the following:取る撮る録る執る摂る捕る獲る穫る採る盗るWhile I've seen 取る ("to take") and 撮る ("to record") relatively frequently, the rest appear rather foreign to me.  What do they mean, and how are they used
I am puzzled by the word ordering in the following sentence:そのうちの一つの[箱]{はこ}は私のです。This sounds unnatural to me, though I was told that this is correct by a native speaker (who was not able to explain why). Whenever I've encountered this linking/nominalization/possessive particle before, the nouns were ordered with increasing specificity. (e.g. 友達の本の名前).Based on that principle, I would have expected the sentence to readその[箱]{はこ}のうちの一つは私のです。I.e.:most general: 箱 (box(es)),more specific 箱のうち (amongst the boxes)most specific: 箱のうちの一つ (one of the boxes)What am I missing

I've seen it in a number of places, mostly in contexts like this one:彼氏と随分仲が良いFor me, it feels like 随分仲 translates to "relationship".What worries me is thatI have not found the exact pair 随分+仲 in any dictionaries.随分 is an adjective, for extremely仲 by itself should already say relationship.So, what does this combination really mean Why can't I find it defined anywhere, even though I find many examples of its use in the web
Are kanji typically for numbers used in times and datesFor example, would "七" and "十五" in the first sentence, and "九" and "三" in the second sentence be normal Japanese (I'm aware that the following uses hiragana instead of kanji in some circumstances, such as "いま" being used instead of "今")いま、七時十五分です。あしたは九月三日木よう日です。About writing numbers using Japanese numerals vs using Arabic numerals implies that "十月九日", which uses kanji for numbers, would be typical Japanese.
This is the "sentence": 暴力は悪*だと非難する|  condemn violence as evilSounds simple The English translation does not give a subject so I wonder are either が or をcorrect if I modify the sentence as follows:彼らは暴力 [が/を] 悪だと非難した ｜They condemned violence as evil.I think を is consistent with the pattern in the following two sentences so I suspect that is the natural choice and although が is also grammatically correct it is not used.    彼らは彼を無能だと非難した|  They blamed him  for incompetence彼は私を不注意だと批判した|  He criticised me for being carelessIf が is the natural choice then I anticipate this will relate to the nature of the combinations of 暴力＆悪；彼＆無能：私＆不注意 but I'd be grateful if someone could explain this. All these came from プログレッシブ英和・和英辞典. *As a secondary question is this 悪 read as あく or わる？
There's a similar question here:Katakana words with Kanji. How did that happenQuestionSome words are written with katakana, but also have kanji. For  example:コーヒー　珈琲ページ　頁How did this happen They are loanwords, but no doubt had Japanese  equivalents before these variants were imported. Is that the case And  are these original words now forgottenAnswerhad Japanese equivalents before the English variants were importedCoffee is not native to Japan, and did not have an equivalent; that  kanji sequence is ateji."Page" is that kanji, but it's properly pronounced 「けつ」 in sequences.My question is though how often does Katakana-based words have an equivalent Kanji
The particle と can mean either a fairly simple "And" or it can mean if X then Y.1: 私は犬と猫が好きです  - I like dogs and cats2: びんを落すと壊れる  - if drop the bottle, it breaksTaken independently either of these rules is easy to remember. In fact と as "and" is probably one of the earliest things you learn in Japanese. With these two simple example sentences it is quite easy to figure out what is going on.But, when you're reading a longer passage things might not be so clear.Are there any rules for spotting the difference between the two　とsFor example with example 2, how do you absolutely 100% know that it means drop it=&gt; it breaks, rather than just drop it and break it in a unrelated actions, listy sort of way
So, I'm the type to understand how languages work than actually speaking them. One thing which I really have a problem with is how で and は works. After a bit of searching, I learned that で meant にて, and that was fine and all, but that also complicated some stuff. Such as why is the て there relevant Why not just use に and forget about でI then decided to look at other languages. One thing I realized, mostly in English, is how if you say "a is b," that doesn't mean "a == b," it means that "a is in the list of b." I also then looked at the uses of the て form of verbs and they seem to create a relationship between the two verbs, and from that, I decided that the て there would connect the に section to the verb. So, an example would be 「これはきれいである」 would mean that "This is in the list of pretty(things).Then, I was pretty much satisfied with that, until 「ではない」. That pretty much made everything confusing to me again, on a large-scale. What I don't understand is how the は there is relevant, why would you just not simply use 「でない」 instead of 「ではない」 What makes them so distinguishedI'm really having a hard time trying to understand this, it's been a month, and I still haven't been able to find and in-depth article about this, and decided to come here instead.

A passage from the textbook I quoted in this question contains the following sentence (emphasis added):それでは助動詞に続かず不便なので、のちに、それを補うために、連用形のあとにラ変動詞「あり」をつけて、「高く＋あり→高かり」のように熟合させたのが活用表の左の系列の活用である。I am unable to find the lexical item 熟合 (read じゅくごう My IME won't convert that to anything useful, so perhaps not) in any of the dictionaries I have consulted, including goo辞典, kotobank, and Weblio EJ-JE. I think I can more or less guess at the meaning based on the kanji and the context in which it appears - 熟合する is probably something like "to combine" or "to merge" - but given that it doesn't show up in the online dictionaries I have access to, I'd like to double-check. I presume 熟合 isn't a typo, given that I've found a few other uses of it online, including Weblio辞典's explanation of the etymology of さすが (emphasis added):副詞「さ」，サ変動詞「す」，接続助詞「がに」が熟合した「さすがに」から「に」が脱落したもの。
Can anyone tell me, what is the difference between 住んでいたい and 住みたいBoth seem to be valid words... But I'm unsure which I should be using.
I recently came across the word 築く, meaning "to build", but I already knew a word for it, 建てる.Looking a bit further into it, 築く seems to include the figurative meaning of "build" as well, such as in "to build relations" or "to build/amass riches", but still has it's literal meaning in actually building some structure.I notice in my example sentences that 築く is commonly used on "bigger" structures, such as a castle. Is this the caseWhat is the difference between these two words, and how are they used differently, if any

I was intrigued by this question: What do you do if a genkoyoshi line ends with e.g. す。」 and its answer.I'm not any good at this 原稿用紙 but I remember being told for some types of forms (which I thought followed the same rules) that you need to put the [濁点]{だくてん} (for some reason always called ten-ten and maru in the classes and contexts I heard them) into separate boxes. Was I being misled / is this still current practice for some sort of form
There's a particular style of joke/pun in Japanese that I'm not sure how to describe, so let me provide some examples:カミングスーン、神だけに。 (said by someone who has recently become a 神)バスケットだけに助っ人募集中。 (said by someone who is looking for people to help out a basketball team)A: それに、学校の皆に会えば、キャッチフレーズが思いつきそうだなあって。  B: 思いつく？  C: お餅つきだけに！ (following a conversation about giving mochi to classmates and trying to come up with a catchphrase)Now that we've established what I'm talking about, my questions are as follows:Is there a name for these jokes (Would you just call them ダジャレ)What is going on grammatically in these jokes This doesn't seem to be one of the  simple/compositional usages of だけ＋に found e.g. here at dictionary.goo.ne.jp.Is there a rough English equivalent of these jokes I've seen translations that basically introduce a pun related to the topic of the joke and then append "No pun intended", presumably corresponding to the だけに part. Of course, joke translation is a peril-fraught thing, so I'm not placing too much stock in this.
I know both of these particles are used to list items. So, I was trying to write the sentence "I like Japanese culture, history and stuff." 私は日本文化と日本史といろいろが好きです。But someone told me it is accurate to say私は日本文化や日本史などが好きです。Why is this accurate Is the first sentence grammatically incorrect
These word pairs both seem to mean "Convenient/Inconvenient". But what is the difference between them and usage casesFrom looking at their kanji and a few example sentences, this is what I've come up with. Is this correct便利/不便: A physical object is convenient. e.g., "This tool is convenient"都合がいい/悪い: A situation is convenient. e.g., "That day is convenient"
We have been taught a lot of uses of よう pattern like ように, Vます ように, sentence ending with ように, ようだ for comparison, etc. But everywhere in textbooks, the よう is written in hiragana. I recently found out that よう actually has a kanji 様. On checking jisho.org, I found that 様     よう  1: (Usually written using kana alone) (usu. after the -masu stem of a verb) appearing ...; looking ...;  2: (usu. after the -masu stem of a verb) way to ...; method of ...ing;  3: (usu. after a noun) form; style; design;  4: (usu. after a noun) like; similar to; (Noun) thing (thought or spoken)So according to them, the only time it is written in hiragana is when よう follows the ます形. However my (non-native) teacher says it is always written in hiragana when it is used as a grammar pattern. As a result, I am pretty much confused how it is written.I have read istrasci's answer to the question When should I replace kanji with hiragana, where he mentions that when writing elementary books, kanjis are often intentionally written in hiragana, since children can't recognize them that easily. Is this a possible reason why よう is written in hiragana or is よう really written always in hiragana when using as grammar pattern If it is at all written in kanji, how to distinguish those casesOn a side note, many words are written specifically in hiragana when used for grammatical purposes. In such cases, what impression do I give to the reader if I write those words (unknowingly) in kanji

Suppose that you're writing on genkoyoshi (原稿用紙), and you are writing a quotation, e.g. 「これはペンです。」And let's say that each line of the genkoyoshi has 8 blocks. The first block would, I presume, be occupied by 「, followed by one block for each of the kana こ・れ・は・ペ・ン・で. What do you do with the rest of the quotation My understanding is that you're not supposed to put punctuation at the beginning of a new line, so you can't split it す and 。」, nor す。 and 」. Do you just glom all of す。」 into a single block (Or do you just never include a 。 immediately prior to a closing 」)

Every evening, we play the かたづけ怪獣 song, where they sing:おかたづけができないとあらあら、大変 (x3)おかたづけ怪獣が出て来るぞ！Now I've been grappling with this language long enough that ‥ができないと  sounds natural in this context, while ‥はできないと sounds off, but I couldn't put my finger on why.  My wife, a native speaker, pondered this for a moment and then theorized that は would be a simple statement of fact:If you can't clean up, the cleanup monster will come!While が implies that, while there may be lots of things you can't do, surely you can at least clean up:If you can't even clean up, the cleanup monster will come!I buy the first half of that explanation, but the second seems fuzzy.  Is she right, and is there a more general rule here
In Japanese, how do I refer to my mother's cousinShe and my mother share the same great-grandparents.  My mother's cousin's mother was the older sister of my mother's father (my maternal grandfather).I think the English term for my relationship to her is that she is my first cousin once removed (my mother's cousin has no children, whereas many websites about calculating cousin relations tend to want you to start from your generation and move outward [i.e., my second cousin's mother is...]).  I think if she had had children, they would be my second cousins.  Is this correctI am writing my first email to my mother's cousin's Japanese relative and I do not know in what way the two of them are related (whether on her father's side, meaning the addressee is also on my side of the family, or on her mother's side, in which case the addressee is from the opposite side of her family tree), but I want her to easily understand what my relation is to my mother's cousin.http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%84%E3%81%A8%E3%81%93#.E3.81.84.E3.81.A8.E3.81.93.E9.81.95.E3.81.84
In the New Yorker there is an English translation of a story by Haruki Murakami, called Yesterday. I was reading the first part of it to my wife, and the young man speaking asked, "Did she let you go all the way" referring to the extent of the other young man's sexual experience.My wife immediately asked whether the common English expression "to go all the way," referring to sexual intercourse, would be that similar in Japanese. I answered that I didn't know, but that it might be a fairly universal concept. I assured her that more detailed American English slang on that topic would not be mirrored word for word. Well, of course the next sentence mentioned "third base" in the same context. Now I didn't know what to tell her! So I am asking here:  In the US, young people say, using baseball terminology, "first base," meaning  kissing, or "second base," touching the girl's breasts, or "third base," "home plate," or "all the way", meaning the same as home plate or sexual intercourse.Is there some sort of analogous slang used by young people in JapaneseThank you very much, especially for not making fun of my silly question!
I know that the kanji 英 now really has the exclusive meaning of "English", such as in 英語, but I'm wondering what the original meaning was.

Working on practice problems for JLPT N1,had the following sentence:むやみに　知らない人に話しかけないほうがいい。Correct answer per the book is よく考えないで.Incorrect answer per the book 勝手にCan someone tell me why the former is to be preferred
I have a question about the meanings and usage of いいように. I thought that it only has one meaning, which is "to act as one wills, to do something as one wills". Like in the example below.彼らは、いいように[操]{あやつ}られている。 They are being led by the nose.At least before I saw the dialogue below, specifically this sentence - あくまでもいいように[捉]{とら}えればと言うことだが。. I was told that here いいように has the meaning same as よい方. And as far as I can understand, translation would sound something like "But only if I take it from the positive side." or "But only positively speaking.". Unfortunately I couldn't find this meaning/translation in dictionaries. So, could you please explain me the this expression.鈴:「じゃ、それで何か楽しいことしないと損じゃない？」私:「[損得勘定]{そん・とく・かん・じょう}の問題でもないように思いますけどね、これは」鈴:「なにさ、[相変]{あい・か}わらず細かいなー君は」鈴さんが[鷹揚]{おう・よう}過ぎるのだと思う。あくまでもいいように捉えればと言うことだが。
Here are the example sentences.デイビットは料理が上手そうです。デイビットは料理が上手なようです。デイビットは料理が上手らしいです。Firstly, what does デイビット mean as based on reading alone its sounds like 'debit' to me which is a strange name to have. Secondly, all three of these grammar points have a similar meaning of 'looks' or 'seems' but obviously have nuanced differences and different uses. As far as I do know, そうです is used more for a first impression 'looks' or 'seems' than the other two but I could be wrong.
I’m struggling to translate and understand this example dialogue from my textbook.学生：先生、どうして私たちはこんなにたくさん漢字を勉強させられるんですか。先生：だれも勉強させていませんよ。だれのために勉強しているんですか。学生: 自分です。My attempt at translation:Student: Teacher, why must we study lots of these kind of Kanji Teacher: Not everyone has to study them…..Student: Myself. I’m not entirely sure why the causative-passive form is being used in the first sentence. Why not just causative I also don’t understand how to translate だれのために and have it make sense – ‘In order for who’
The English word "centipede" refers to basically the same type of disgusting creepy-crawly arthropod as the Japanese ムカデ. Sometimes, ムカデ is written in kanji as 百足. This is an obvious case of ateji (you would never read 百 in isolation as ム or ムカ, nor 足 as カデ or デ). It so happens that "centipede" comes from the Latin centi- "hundred" + pedis "foot". This suggests that it is certainly possible that the use of 百足 ("hundred" + "foot") stems from a direct calque of "centipede", or a cognate of "centipede" in some other language like Dutch or Portuguese. Is this in fact the caseNote: it is entirely possible that the answer to this question is well-known and readily available in standard online sources. I wouldn't know, since I have not actually done any research on this topic, because that entails a risk of coming across pictures of centipedes. I do hope you will forgive me this.
So I started watching the movie あかひげ the other night and intrigued by the title I looked it up in the dictionary  where one of the definitions was:Westerner (derogatory)Does it really contain this meaningHow is this used (if it is indeed used!) in modern Japanese If it's not used what word can be used to express "Westerner (derogatory)" in modern Japanese
In class, I was told that ホームシック is a noun, not a な-adjective.ホームシックの時、何をしますか。By contrast, the closest English word to "ホームシック", which is "homesick", is an adjective.Why is ホームシック a noun Is it describing a disease (if you had to use English, you might say "homesickness"), rather than the state of having the disease
Reading a Japan Times column, I see:But we still have no word for an immigrant as an individual person, such as iminsha, with its own honorific sha — in the same vein as ijūsha (migrant), rōdōsha (laborer), teijūsha (settler, usually a Nikkei South American), zairyūsha (temporary resident), eijūsha (permanent resident) and even (in a few government documents) kikasha (naturalized citizen).Does the above reasoning make sense
I was looking through a dictionary and came across 生活. My original question wasIs this the difference between 生気／生活生気 would be like an idea of life. more abstract生活 would be concrete. So like something/one's life.My new question is can you help me to understand the different ways "life" is said in Japanese I actually forgot about 人生 and 命 when I wrote the question. I didn't know about ライフ／生命／一生 (and others). I think 人生 would usually be when talking about a person's life right
Apparently the phrase でならない means something like "unable to suppress". For example, in this sentence, 残念{ざんねん}でならない means, "can't help but be disappointed":特{とく}に最近{さいきん}の若{わか}い人{ひと}は教育{きょういく}制度{せいど}の影響{えいきょう}か、早{はや}くからもう自分{じぶん}の将来{しょうらい}はこのくらいのものだと見切{みき}りをつけて、それ以上{いじょう}は望{のぞ}まないと言{い}うような考{かんが}えの人{ひと}が少{すく}なからずいるのは残念{ざんねん}でならない。But I just can't see how でならない can be parsed that way. It's not a double negative or anything, and it just seems to be the negative form of なる.Recently, in response to another question I asked, I was reminded how なる is attached to words to mean "to become". So, I would translate 残念{ざんねん}でならない as "not become disappointed", which would completely reverse the meaning of the sentence above.What is the logic behind 残念{ざんねん}でならない meaning "can't help but be disappointed", and why does it not mean "does not become disappointed" How can I differentiate this phrase from instances where ならない simply means "does not become"
In the book I'm reading (「キッチン」 by 吉本{よしもと}ばなな) I have found the following sentence:うしろで雄一がぞうきんを手に床をふいてくれていた。I guess it can be translated to something like (sorry for a quite literal translation): "Behind (me) Yuuichi was wiping the floor with a cloth using his hands".This sentence has two を. One of them (床をふいてくれていた) I understand as marking the direct object (floor) of the verb (wipe).I cannot understand what the other を is doing there (ぞうきんを). What meaning does it have What grammatical pattern is used in here
I'd like to say "I introduced Mary to John" but only really know how to use 紹介する when talking about a single person. Is に the correct particle to use in this situation For example: ジョンにメリーを紹介しました。
I have to make a Japanese presentation and I'd like to say "I'll explain japanese demographics using three graphs", but then realized I didn't know the counter for graphs. Can someone help me out
As part of my studies, I started to translate lyrics of songs I enjoy.It was going well until I bumped with this phrase.止まらない胸の歪を消しておくれよI'm think it translates somewhat to: "Late to erase the distortion of the unstoppable chest"Since Japanese a null subject language, the subject can be omitted and asserted from the context rightOn this phrase, there no indication whatsoever who is talking or who is listening. I'd like know the subject of this phrase and why is so.Here is the lyric of the current song止まらない胸の歪を消しておくれよアメジストすれ違ってく心君と僕の狭間で揺れる カケラ空っぽに堕ちてゆく夜を救っておくれよ アメジストすれ違ってく 君と僕の染まる黒い闇を 透明な光でThanks for your time :)
There are a lot of post that describe the ambiguous scenarios when to use で vs に, but there are still many scenarios that are confusing, and sometimes I'm not sure if I should be using a particle at all.Here are a list of simple questions where the usage of particles is uncertain.１．春（に｜で｜NONE）たくさん雨が降る。２．春（に｜で｜NONE）雨だ。(Any verb influence)３．雨の日（に｜で｜NONE）きれいだ。４．今月の三十一日（に｜で｜NONE）日本に行く。５．休み（に｜で）日本に行く。６．一時間（に｜で｜NONE）食べた。７．日本語（で｜を）おねがいします。(A different question, but I was still curious.)
Why don't 後で and 前に both use the same particle (I suppose I would think に would be more appropriate.) They both seem to be the same kind of statement, just with different times (before/after), so I really can't think of any reason for the particle discrepancy.
They have created many new Katakana words such as ファ フィ ヴァ ヴィ ティ テゥ to write foreign sounds. But why didn't they create a new combination for "hu" such as ハゥ or ホゥ Instead they use the same kana for "hu" and "fu" and make the situation sometimes more confuse.It's not because most of them can't pronounce it since they can't pronounce "V" either, replaced with ヴイ for differentiation, and in most cases it's still being pronounced as "B". Even if to Japanese it's /hu/ as they have /ha hi hu he ho/ then why don't create a special case for /fu/ when they had created /fa fi fe fo/. In other words why don't they write /fu/ and /hu/ differently like in the case of /va/ and /ba/
Looking at the JLPT website and its example questions I come across this one on N3.It wants to know which sentence is correct, 今ごろ is the key word.それでは今ごろテストを始めます今ごろ東京では桜が咲いているでしょう今ごろ現金で支払うことが少なくなった今ごろ雨が降りそうな天気だ。The answer is 2. I guessed correctly. But…why is this soNumber 3 seems a bit wrong. It should be something more like recently than about now.Number 4 stands out as totally wrong. Why would you say about now it looks like rain1 however…I’m not sure why 1 can’t be correct. Translating it to English- “the test will be starting about now” seems a pretty sensible sentence. The person overseeing the exam would never say such a thing of course but I could well imagine the mother of a school boy who doesn’t know the exact time the test is starting but knows it is 3ish, looking up at the clock and saying that.What is so different about the Japanese nuance that this doesn’t workWhat would be a more natural word to use in that situationIs 今ごろ meant for more solidly known facts or...what
Is it like 平安 is used mainly when talking about the 平安時代 or in terms of historical peace
Everywhere I look, they both just seem to be defined as "special" or "particularly/especially" (in the adverbial case).I'm trying to form a distinction in my head.Here's an example from my dictionary for 特別:今日は 特別に あつらえた服を着ます (Today I'll wear specially-ordered clothes)Why can't it be今日は 特に あつらえた服を着ます Or another case (from JED):今朝は 特に 寒い (today it's especially cold)Maybe someone can provide examples for me where they can't be interchanged - or examples that emphasize the difference.I would be greatly appreciative.
(I hope this question is just a sanity check but these things are sometimes worth asking.)On p31 of the Dictionary of Intermediate Japanese Grammar, Makino tells us that anaphoric personal pronouns are limited to the third person (彼, 彼ら etc), and would therefore exclude 私 etc.  Is this an over-generalisation (rather like his explanation of how かい is used in the "Basic dictionary", discussed in another recent question)
I wonder if someone could confirm my understanding of the grammar in the following sentence on p32 of the Dictionary of Intermediate Japanese Grammar:さて、教員は清兵衛から取り上げた瓢箪（ひょうたん）を汚れた物ででもあるかのように、捨てるように、年寄った学校の小使いにやってしまった。　　Later the teacher gave the gourd he had taken from Seibei to an old janitor as if it was a filthy object.I think it is taken from a children's story so it is supposed to be written with basic words but results in a difficult expression*.My clumsy analysis of the section 汚れた物ででもあるかのように、捨てるように is汚れた物で= "it is a dirty object and/but.."でもあるか＝  "we still have it!",   でも="still" in the sense of extreme, か conveys surprise(か)のように、＝ "as if", the particles indicate that the preceding expression describes the position of the teacher to the gourd ("It is dirty, and we still have it!")捨てるように = in order to throw away[小使いにやってしまった = gave it to the janitor]If I put this together I think we find the teacher:"gave [the gourd] to the janitor, as if it was being thrown away, as if it was something still in our possession that was dirty[and therefore should be thrown out]"Is this correct Could we replace ででもあるかのように with として If so, how much of the poetical nature of the original Japanese would be lost*It may just be me but I often found the "simple" explanations of grammatical expressions in the JLPT books that use this type of language harder than the expressions itself!
I've been told several times that things like class and classmate don't have non-loan words (I don't know what those are called) associated with them in Japanese. This seems ludicrous to me, as the ideas must have existed since well before the loan words were ever heard. So what causes loan words such as クラス to become so popular
As I understand, Japanese numbers are divided into blocks of four, so while we would think of the number 89123889 as 89,123,889, in Japan they would think of it as 8912,3889 (八千九百十二万三千八百八十九). So English uses thousands and Japanese uses tens of thousands.Is there any particular reason for this Not that it matters either way, I'm just wondering at what point either culture chose to delimit numbers by thousands, or tens of thousands.If you reply with Japanese, please use hiragana and furigana only, except for number kanji.
I have a question about the usage of ていられる. Can we use it when we speak about somebody else, not about yourself. The examples I've seen are only about the speaker.  For example in the sentence below the speaker（僕） is telling that those doctors can't even make an anesthesia well    ことさら感情を廃して話す僕に、彼女も徹底的に無感動な応対をする。 こういった手合いのほうがはっきり言って有難い。  性質の悪い嗜虐心などに盛った医者では、おちおち麻酔もかけていられない。Context: 僕 - speaker, the patient. 彼女 is the doctor, and by 「性質の悪い嗜虐心などに盛った医者では、おちおち麻酔もかけていられない。」 sentence the speaker is telling about the doctors he has been before.
Is there anymore to the usage of なんか that isn't saying "something", but rather something like, or along the lines of I know the two are very similar, but using なんか at the end of a sentence seems to be very clear syntactically, while using it to modify a noun seems weird, especially given the か at the end- further kanji isn't generally used, I don't think. So is there more to it Is there a more formal way of saying it that would make sense syntactically
I was reading Eiríkr Útlendi's answer about -い vs. -き in 形容詞 and noticed that he identified -く as the 未然形 of 形容詞. When I studied classical Japanese, though, I was taught that 形容詞 lack a 未然形 (and also lack a 命令形, of course). This jives with my (probably poor) intuition about how 形容詞 conjugate - you can't say *美しくず or *美しくぬ for the negative of 美し - you have to say 美しくあらず or 美しからぬ or something like that (i.e. using the 連用形, which is 美しく, adding an あり, and then tacking a negation 助動詞 onto the 未然形 of あり, which is あら). Are there multiple schools of thought on whether or not 形容詞 have a 未然形 The textbook I used was 新編文語文法 by 大野晋, in case that helps.UPDATE: I found my textbook; it states the following in the section on 形容詞の活用の種類 (p. 30): for the ク活用, we have two patterns of conjugation (未然・連用・終止・連体・已然・命令):  1.　　 〇　　　　　―く　　　　　―し　　　　　―き　　　　　―けれ　　　　 〇 2.　　―から　　　　―かり　　　（―かり）　　　―かる　　　（―かる）　　　―かれLikewise, we have two patterns of conjugation for シク活用: 1.　　 〇　　　　　―しく　　　　―し　　　　　―しき　　　　―しけれ　　　 〇 2.　　―しから　　　―しかり　　（―しかり） 　　―しかる　　（―しかる）　　―しかれThe textbook does not specifically name the (2.) conjugations as the カリ活用 and シカリ活用, but does mention them. In any case, the textbook specifically claims that in their "bare" form (without あり), 形容詞 do not have a 未然形 (p. 31; emphasis added):「ク活用」「シク活用」のいずれの場合も、本来の活用は「〇・く・し・き・けれ・〇」「〇・しく・し・しき・しけれ・〇」で、未然形・命令形がなかった。それでは助動詞に続かず不便なので、のちに、それを補うために、連用形のあとにラ変動詞「あり」をつけて、「高く＋あり→高かり」のように熟合させたのが[the (2.) conjugations]である。これによって未然形・命令形を補うと共に、助動詞との接続が自由になった。
In the manga, there are symbols above the cars when they race. In the picture below, it says ガッアアアア in katakana. What does it mean Is it the sound of drifting or an engine
Off the top of my head I remember hearing these sentences, which I assume are just shortenings:すみません, 分からん絶対許さん!Along with these two I've seen in sentence examples:もう我慢できん彼にはその文の意味が理解できんかった - this one is a little funky, since there is no complete ない-&gt;ん conversion, but instead なかった-&gt;んかったIs this kind of shortening common Can one always shorten a verb-ending ない to ん
What is the difference between 美しき and 麗しき and what is the difference between 美しい and 美しきI know that both 美しい女性 and 美しき女性 are correct. But what is the difference between these two
As in このオレさま and この僕も. I know the literal translation, but I never understood what the intent of it is.
Still with the Zelda guidebook translation :)I cannot understand the meaning of the third line. It uses ・・・そう・・・なかった. I understand -そう as "seems like" and なかった as past negative, but how do these go togetherNote: My translation tries to stay as close to the original Japanese as possible whilst still making sense. I find it helps me for future reference if I translate the words rather than the meaning (so that's why it comes across as sounding like Master Yoda is speaking).まずはマップとコンパスを手に入れたい。First of all map and compass you will want to obtain.それを頼りに、宝箱のある部屋をチェックして回れば、そのダンジョンだけにある特別な　アイテムをゲット出来るはずだ。 Relying on these, if you check the rooms around the treasure chest place [on the map], that dungeon as might be expected special item should be got (collected).それがあれば、行けそうで行けなかった場所、解けそうで解けなかった謎の多くが解決する。If you [do] that, a place it looks like you were not able to go to, many mysteries it looked like you could not solve can be resolved ()
In my JLPT practise book, there is this section of text. Sorry, it's a little long, but I hope the question isn't overly complex.（前略{ぜんりゃく}）かつて私{わたし}たちの国{くに}では、花{はな}の美{うつく}しさというように、抽象{ちゅうしょう}観念{かんねん}によって美{うつく}しいものをとらえようとする言{い}い方{かた}も乏{とぼ}しく、したがってそのような考{かんが}え方{かた}もほとんどなかった。（　　）、というようなことばや考{かんが}え方{かた}を私{わたし}たちに教{おし}えてくれたのは、やはり西欧{せいおう}舶来{はくらい}のことばであり、その翻訳語{ほんやくご}だったのである。Not a direct translation, but my general understanding is that, "Japan (well... "our country") didn't used to have words for abstract concepts, like the beauty of a flower. Abstract concepts were learned from the west, drawn from terms used in translation." Maybe. Something like that.The question is to place one of the following two terms in the brackets:花{はな}の美{うつく}しさ抽象{ちゅうしょう}観念{かんねん}I chose  抽象{ちゅうしょう}観念{かんねん}, but the correct answer turns out to be 花{はな}の美{うつく}しさ.I think where I got confused was with the very last sentence, after where it says やはり.　It says something like "Of course, there are words from the west, those translation terms were there"... I think maybe it's だったのである that is throwing me off.What would be an accurate translation for the last sentence in this text, and how does it support the right answer for what goes in the brackets
In my JLPT practise book, there is this sentence, which is designed to test if one can track all the negations:その仕事{しごと}ほどおもしろくない仕事{しごと}はないのではないかと、私{わたし}は思{おも}った。Up to の, I think it's saying, "there is no job as uninteresting as that job." But then we hit のではない, and I get a bit lost. I feel like it's saying "there is no job where there is no job as boring as that job," which doesn't really make sense.How do I parse this sentence so that I can understand whether the speaker thinks その仕事{しごと} is interesting or uninteresting
I know two verbs which are translated as "to get/receive," namely, 得る and もらう. From the usages in which I've seen them used, they seem to be interchangeable; are my suspicions correct or is there a difference I should be aware ofFor what it's worth, I see 得る usually translated as "to get" and "もらう" usually translated as "to receive." In the textbooks I'm using, もらう was introduced much, much earlier than 得る- but obviously curricula aren't necessarily indicative of actual usage.
A friend posted on a social network a picture of his Subaru car's bumper after an minor accident, and got this comment:大丈夫！バンパー外すよりまし！笑I guess it means "No problem! Removing the bumper will make it look better! lol"But what is the exact meaning of よりまし in this sentenceIt's in Kansai if that matters.
While looking around, I found this [湯冷ましを兼ねて] expression that no dictionary has been able to translate.Examples of use would be the [再び湯冷ましを兼ねて周辺を徘徊。] line in this post or the first sentence in this tweet, just picking up two random google results.
I found this in a phrase: 隠れていなくて.I can translate it simply as "aren't hiding" or "were hiding"By the way, is it correct or is 隠れていません betterBy the way, the whole phrase isお前はやはり私のような強いものの後ろに隠れていなくてはな。
I noticed that many Japanese businessmen tend to address the colleagues they are traveling with, or even introduce themselves as ◯◯◯さん. This would clearly be a faux-pas in a Japanese-only meeting, yet it almost seems like the norm in international meetings.Is this a social engineering hack to get the foreigners to call them さん Or do they think this is less confusing this way Is it a way to help the foreigners figure out that the strange sound they heard before the "san" is a name Is there some "How to do business with gaijins" book that this practice is spreading fromI've tried asking my Japanese friends, but no one could come up with a convincing answer...
I have been translating articles from NHK News Easy for practice, and I've noticed they sometimes use 「など」in a way I'm not familiar with. For example, in an article about a train that's about to be decommissioned because of its age, this sentence occurs:このためＪＲ西日本などは、トワイライトエクスプレスの運転を来年の春にやめることにしました。I don't really understand the meaning of 「ＪＲ西日本など」, since my grammar resources explain the meaning of the suffix など as "non-exhaustive listing, like "etc.". So, does this mean that "JR West Japan and others" decided to retire the train
Which words most commonly follow どういうI know certain collocations already, such as どういうこと and どういう意味.  But my speech isn't always very natural-sounding, and I'm curious if there are any common collocations I don't use at the moment. Is there a list
This has always been a problem for me, so I'm hoping you guys can answer it once and for all.Often, I want to ask somebody if they've ever done something before. For example, in an email yesterday I was talking about a trip to Yorkshire and wanted to ask my friend"have you ever eaten Yorkshire Pudding"(when he was living in the UK a few years ago.)I can find a couple of ways to express this.ヨークシャープディング食べたことある？ / を食べた　ことが　ありますか？ヨークシャープディングを食べましたか？These both feel, more so the last one, like I am asking "recent" rather than "ever". I've always associated "Ｘを食べましたか？" with recent activity, I guess from my early lessons e.g. "昨日レストランに行きました"　"そうですか？何を食べましたか"Are these sufficient to ask "have you ever eaten Yorkshire Pudding" In English I would say"Have you ever eaten Yorkshire Pudding" or "Have you eaten Yorkshire Pudding before" rather than"Have you eaten Yorkshire Pudding"Perhaps my English is wrong lol
The way I understand it 彼【かれ】 means 'that person over there' and あちら also means 'that person over there'
I am looking to translate "acceptance versus rejection" in the same sense as "acceptance versus alienation". Is the following statement grammatically correct Does it make sense to word the following in Japanese拒絶反応対受け入れ
In the novel I'm reading now (「キッチン」 by 吉本{よしもと}ばなな) there is a passage about moving house and preparing 引っ越しハガキ. What is 引っ越しハガキ I guess it's some kind of a note/postcard you prepare when you move but can someone give a more detailed explanation, please Is it to notify people you know to let them know your new address
Related: の意味は何 versus はどういう意味I was wondering why どういう is used in situations like asking for meanings of words, or in something like どういう状況, for "What's going on here" Does anyone have a good reason why saying "How would you say" is favored over just asking a direct question like "What is the situation" or "What is the meaning"
I am writing an email to my friends, about a trip. We went walking by a field and the cows came over and were happy to be petted.I want to say "the cows were happy and friendly" but the word I have in my notes is 親しい which seems to be for a close friend, and the word "intimate" is used. The cows were not that friendly ;-)Seriously, is there another word I can use Like the equivalent of "good-natured" perhaps
I need some help with translating my Legend of Zelda guidebook.ダンジョンアイテムを探せ！Search for dungeon items!ダンジョンでの目的はもちろんボスを倒すことだが、ものには順序というものがある。まずはマップとコンパスを手に入れたい。I'm a bit stuck with the second line. Something like"In a dungeon the objective is of course beating the boss, but [finding] things there really is an order"Yeah... a bit stuck as you can see!I assume ものには is hiding a verb, but even then I am unsure of the sentence.Typically in the Zelda games you have to find a specific item before you can get to other chambers and then fight the boss. So it must be referring to that.
For example, you're talking to someone and he's trying to explain something to you, and you have no idea what he's going on about. You could just say "I don't understand", sure, but is there something more akin to the English "I'm lost"
This question already has answers here:                                            Adjectives functioning both as イ- and ナ-adjective                                (2 answers)                            Closed 5 years ago.Is there any difference in meaning between 小さな and 小さい / 大きな and 大きい I know that they have different syntactical rules, but semantically is there any difference I was once told that 大きな was more appropriate for non-physical things, e.g. 大きな声.
In my JLPT practise book, the following exchange between a man and a woman is part of a longer exchange in a listening section:女{おんな}：先日{せんじつ}は町内{ちょうない}集会{しゅうかい}、お疲{つか}れさまでした。男{おとこ}：お疲{つか}れさま。次{つぎ}の役員{やくいん}が決{き}まらなくて、随分{ずいぶん}長{なが}くかかりましたね。So, the woman first thanks the man for his efforts at the previous meeting. Then, if I understand correctly, the guy says that if they don't decide the staff for the next one, then it will have gone on long. The tenses don't add up.I'm confused because he says 次{つぎ}, as if he's talking about the next meeting, but the sentence ends with the past tense, as if he was talking about a previous meeting.Is the man talking about the next or previous meeting And what exactly is he saying about it
Is there any difference in meaning between 護{まも}る and 守{まも}る When there are multiple kanji for a particular reading (like 暑{あつ}い/熱{あつ}い or 初{はじ}め/始{はじ}め), they are frequently used in different situations (hot weather/hot to touch or first time/start). According to the dictionaries (jisho.org and a pocket dictionary) 守{まも}る is more common, but the story I'm reading now is using 護{まも}る. So I was wondering if there would be any particular reason for using 護 over 守.
The sentence pattern for "I have never X" is covered in this question:  Is there a form for "I have never heard of"However, I'm confused on which particle to use for the noun in this sentence pattern.  For example:From a Japanese children's book:こんなに大きなももはみたことがない。  "I have never seen a peach as large as this."Notice that it uses は after もも.  Here is a second example from the cited question.その歌{うた}を聞いたことがありません。  "I have never heard that song before."It uses を after うた. Are both particles acceptable  Do they convey different meanings
I'm wondering if anyone can provide the origins of the honorific "-ちゃん".  It's a diminutive, and German has "-chen" as a diminutive suffix.  Is that a coincidence  What is the first recorded use of "-ちゃん"
Where does the ぶり in 五年ぶり (Five years ago) and ぶり返す come from, does it have a kanji, and what does it mean
Does saying どこの出身 sound any different than saying 出身はどこ More generally, does adnominally modifying a noun have some other feeling associated with in That is, in comparison to just using a standard subject-predicate construction. (I'm not sure that that is the right descriptor for the second phrasing.)
I am trying to figure this out, but online searches don't seem to be helping. In particular what I'm looking for is something like "In exchange for helping you, please help me" or put more simply "In return for X, Y." To be more precise, used in an actual sentence: "In exchange for me helping you with your English, please help me with my Japanese."
The other day on the train I saw this advertisement for some tabloid, with headlines all over it, as they do:I'm trying to figure out what シ●ブ愛人{あいじん} is. 忍{しのぶ}愛人{あいじん} "Sneaky lover" Assuming 忍{しのぶ} to be something like the "clandestine" definition used in 忍者{にんじゃ}, and not the species of fern. Though, "fern lover" would be kind of interesting.What is a シ●ブ愛人 And why is it censored
I have this sentence in my JLPT exercise book:彼{かれ}は有名人{ゆうめいじん}ゆえの不自由{ふじゆう}さから逃{に}げたくなった。The translation offered is:He wanted to get away from the difficulties of being a celebrity.What is throwing me is the 逃{に}げたくなった part. It seems to me that the past tense form of "wanted to get away" should be 逃{に}げたかった, and the past tense form of "did not want to get away" should be 逃{に}げたくなかった. I feel the English translation probably represents the intended meaning, because it would be weird to not want to get away from difficulties, but on the other hand my own translation of the original Japanese is something along the lines that he did not want to escape.So what is 逃{に}げたくなった Am I wrong about the verb forms I think it should be, or is something else going on here
Title says it all.  When saying それは椅子 would I use あります or です  I've been using です, but from what I've read, it's used to describe an object, and あります to declare it's existence.  So I'm thinking あります would be the correct verb to use.
I am translating some Japanese Documents to English and I came across this text:66歳に到達した日以降に最初に訪れる3月末までSo far I have: Until the end of March...on or after the day of turning 66 years oldHow should one translate this text: 最初に訪れる, in order for it to fit the given textI have read about 訪れる here.Until the end of the coming March then how about the 最初にUntil the end of the first incoming March
I am currently doing some exercises for my Japanese class, but they are all in hiragana, which is sometimes irritating, but in this sentence I fail to see the meaning　and thus unable to pick the suitable answer, 3:ゆうびんきょくに　＿＿　かえります。Available answers are :1) やんで　2) よんで　3) よって 4) やってI thought ~による was used in a sense similar to "According to..." but I really don't see how this fits within the sentence.Is this another usage of the above form A different verb  I really think it is more of a suite of actions, "Do something at the post office and come back". I really wish I had a kanji there to help me out... As a bonus, why do textbooks often contain no kanjis and only hiragana  This seems more confusing that anything else to me.Thanks !
Is お土産{みやげ} an 当{あ}て字{じ}、 熟字訓{じゅくじくん}、 or something elseFor 「お土産」 to be 当て字, the「み」reading must be part of the 音{おん}、訓{くん} readings or a 名乗り{なのり} reading for the「土」kanji. This is not the case.For 「お土産」 to be 「熟字訓」, the meaning of the characters 「土」and「産」when placed side-by-side must approximate the meaning of "souvenir". And this is not the case.So, is the reading of 「お土産」 classified as "non-standard", but not in the sense of 「当て字」 or「熟字訓」 Maybe there is a 3rd classification for words with non-standard readings Is this 3rd classification maybe "難読{なんよ}み" (I've found very little info about 難読み so far).
I'm trying to understand the quote "One Piece is real" and have found the following corresponding expression in Japanese:ワンピース 実在するHowever, this looks more like it means "One Piece does exist".Is the English translation just off and this is the actual meaning, or are there other ways of saying "One Piece is real" in Japanese, which don't mean "One Piece does exist"

Given that やけど means "burn", it seems likely that the やけ part is 焼け. What about the ど, though (The kanji for やけど - i.e. 火傷 - don't help, because those characters are obviously 当て字, and would ordinarily be read かしょう.)
What is the difference between the words 間【あいだ】 and 間【ま】  Both seem to have the basic meaning space or time interval.

I usually self-study, however I see a tutor once a week who is a native from Tokyo. In my previous lesson with her, she used the following:もう夜遅いから家に帰ったほうがいいでしょう。Where 夜遅い translates to "late at night", and the overall translation is something like "Since it's already late, we should head back home."When I asked her if there are rules governing this construct, she was not able to give me a definitive answer, but instead was only able to give me one further example:朝早い = Early in the morningI am wondering, are these two examples just set expressions, or are there rules that govern what noun+adj combinations are possible Is it strictly used with [unit of time (Noun)]+[qualitative (Adj)], or is there a wider range of usage
In my Japanese class, I've been taught that the structure for "to think" is "～と思う", but no explanation was given for why this is the way it is.For instance:日本の中で食べ物は高いと思う。Obviously the first part of the sentence reads, "In Japan, food is expensive" - but the last part doesn't seem to make sense in-context. Maybe it's because I haven't seen grammar structures with multiple verbs before.さけおさんは酒を飲まないと思う。This sentence has effectively the same structure as above, but the ending of the sentence just... doesn't sound right. It doesn't make logical sense given the grammar rules that I know so far.How should I break this sentence down so I can hear this intuitively Is the form "～と思う" part of a larger type of grammar that I am not yet aware ofAdditionally, I've never seen the particle と used this way before. What does it mean here
デジタル大辞泉 gives the following definition of 間投詞:《interjection》「感動詞」に同じ。It also gives the following definition of 感動詞 (emphasis added):品詞の一。自立語で活用がなく、主語にも修飾語にもならず、他の文節とは比較的独立して用いられるもの。話し手の感動を表す「ああ」「おお」の類をはじめ、呼びかけを表す「おい」「もしもし」の類や、応答を表す「はい」「いいえ」の類も、文法的性質が同じなので、国文法ではこれに含まれる。間投詞。感嘆詞。Both terms are identically glossed as "interjection" in all the J-E dictionaries I can find, and the definition for each in デジタル大辞泉 gives the other as a synonym. This is the only case I'm aware of where there are multiple ways of referring to a part of speech (a la 動詞, 名詞, etc.), and so I cannot help but wonder if there is some technical sense in which these two terms differ.
According to the Japanese dictionary, it means "sink or swim", "do or die", or "high stakes", but I can't figure out the etymology.The literal meaning appears to be "one or eight". So does it literally mean "the odds are 1 to 8"
It seems that 「思う」 can bothbe "to think/consider" (actively) as in「義父母を本当の親のように思うのは無理です」and "to feel" (passively) as in「母をなくした子をあわれに思う」.When reading an article in Asahi Shimbun, I bumped into a 3-line poem in which 「思う」 sounded quite ambiguous to me:急行にのって駅を通過するときベンチに腰かけている人がチラリと見えるその人を私のように　思う"I considered the person as myself"？"I felt the person was just like me" "I thought of the person in my way" With no context other than the rest two lines, does it really sound ambiguous
I can't understand why is it used polite form in -「いらっしゃい。逃げ切れるとは思わないで」, I would translate it like this - "Come! Don't think you can run away!". And as far as I can guess シオン is telling it to an enemyカイム：「よし、これでこっちの動きは封じた！」 シオン：「やるわねカイム！さすがあたしの弟！」カノス：「ちっ、先を越されちまったか！今度はこっちの番だ、頼むぜシオン」 シオン：「いらっしゃい。逃げ切れるとは思わないで」 シオン：「Casting some 厨二 spell」 カノス：「はははははっ！派手にやってくれるぜ！！」
In English (and, I assume, its relatives), there is a style of narration called free indirect speech, some examples of which are given in the linked article. I'm having trouble figuring out whether or not Japanese supports something similar. Clearly, Japanese has direct speech (直接話法):A: それはリンゴだ。  B: 「それはリンゴだ」とAは言った。Japanese also has some sort of indirect/reported speech (間接話法):A: それはリンゴだ。  B: Aによると、それはリンゴだそうだ。Can Japanese do free indirect speech (自由間接話法, I guess) What would that look like I get the feeling that Japanese might not have a strong distinction between free and ordinary indirect speech, but am having trouble figuring out what the correct mapping between English indirect speech and Japanese indirect speech is.
The clip and subtitles: http://clyp.it/fmzowhxt組織の命令に背くという事は どういう事か お前は わかってない！So why is 背く being pronounced like that I don't hear a く at all and hear a ふ instead.Also, maybe the following is related(if not, I'll remove it and put it in its own question):http://clyp.it/g01r22ei自宅からウィルスを送ってたら、先走った刑事にウィルスが揃う前に捕まっちまうところだった。I'm hearing おくfってたら instead of of おくってたらhttp://clyp.it/hv3yjmeoバトー！　ナナオはそこを経由して分割したウィルスを送ってきてるSimilarly I'm hearing おくfってきて(And no ～る, but I guess that's a question for another day.)Edit: Revised to clarify that I'm not hearing a full mora but just an 'f' sound in 送fって. I would describe it as a single syllable "okf", but the last time I tried to describe Japanese in terms of syllables(yak'sok'), I was chastised and felt great shame..
During an analysis I was performing of the poems contained in the 古今集 I noticed a curious pattern.  Otherwise perfectly-formed poems included in the collection seemed to ignore the morae-count on a consistent basis with respect to the verb 思ふ【おもふ】, allowing it an extra beat, as you can see in the following examples:6-7-5-7-7:をしと思【おも】ふ  心【こころ】はいとに  よられなむ  ちる花【はな】ごとに  ぬきてとどめむ5-8-5-7-7:五月雨【さみだれ】に  物思ひ【ものおもひ】をれば  郭公【ほととぎす】  夜【よ】ふかくなきて  いづちゆくらむ5-7-6-7-7:夕【ゆふ】ぐれは  雲【くも】のはたてに  物【もの】ぞ思ふ【おもふ】  あまつそらなる  人【ひと】をこふとて5-7-5-8-7:いつはとは  時【とき】はわかねど  秋【あき】のよぞ  物思ふ【ものおもふ】事【こと】の  かぎりなりける5-7-5-7-8:春【はる】きぬと  人【ひと】はいへども  うぐひすの  なかぬかぎりは  あらじとぞ思【おも】ふThese examples are not exhaustive; they are merely to demonstrate the phenomenon and to show that it doesn't matter which line it appears in.What I'm wondering is if the rules on morae-counts are more complex than originally thought and actually have a provision allowing for this, or if there were some other explanation for it.On a similar note, I noticed while researching this question that あらば gets a pass when on a 5-morae line when paired with 3-kana words (e.g. 「こころあらば」、「いのちあらば」), while the related あれば seems to get a free pass in more settings (about 1/3 of total occurrences).  I'm almost inclined to think any potential rule involves the ば form, however that's not a consistent element in the 思ふ cases.
This is a quick one. I read in the dictionary that どれ is only supposed to be used when there are three or more choices. What word should I use if I have only two choices
I know that there are more irregular verbs than just this, but their changes are mostly euphonic and not really of any interest to me. What I would like to know is why 来る and する have developed the way they have. I don't want an answer like "It came from old Japanese" because that's obvious. I'd like to know exactly what caused them to become so irregular. I heard that する came from the verb す, which makes a lot of sense, but it doesn't explain される and させる (I think that they're just auxiliaries, but I'd like confirmation), and 来る is a complete mystery to me. I'm actually surprised this question hasn't been asked before.
In India, regional nationalism is strongly tied to language. This is particularly the case in the Dravidian-speaking south, especially among speakers of Tamil - Tamil nationalists trot out all manner of absurd claims about the ancientness and purity and divine inspiration of the Tamil language, and about the great power held by the ancient Tamil people (until they were oppressed by the wretched Aryans from the north, of course).I point this out to provide context for the following question: is there any actual evidence that Tamil (or any other Dravidian language) has a genetic relationship with JapaneseMy cursory reading on the matter has pointed me to Ono Susumu, who appears to have put forth a hypothesis claiming a genetic link - but that was back in the 1980s, and it appears that his hypothesis has been refuted (that said, I'm basing this on secondary writings - I haven't read the actual papers in question). I am unaware of any recent work that bolsters Ono's conclusions. Yet, Indian news outlets keep on putting out new articles claiming Tamil-Japanese links (e.g. here and here), to the point that many educated Tamil non-linguists take the claims of a Tamil-Japanese genetic relationship as almost-fact. These beliefs are usually of the form "A long, long time ago, the mighty Tamil people traveled through China, crossed into Japan, and brought with them their language, which mixed with or displaced the language already present in Japan at the time" - and you can certainly see how this fits in with the Tamil nationalist narrative I mentioned above.All that said, I'm left wondering if there's some linguistic (or historical) evidence I'm unaware of that makes claims of a Tamil-Japanese link more plausible.

I have been looking for a comprehensive chart for interrogative words and their altered forms. But unfortunately I haven't been able to find one yet. So I thought maybe someone may have already come across one here, since there are a lot of people online.I'm not sure if I see the whole picture clearly when it comes to interrogative words, mainly if we use their altered forms. Such as何 - what...何か - something何も - nothing何でも - anything/everythingだれ - who...だれか - somebodyだれも - nobody  だれでも - anybody/everybodyAnd in the case of だれでも, we can even say だれにでも, right Which means "not to/for anybody" or "to/for everybody".In addition, if I remember correctly if I use negative verb form with だれも, it means nobody; while if I have a positive verb form, だれも carries the meaning 'everybody'. Then if I say だれにも, its meaning can also differ according to that. Is it right or I am just confusedSo this topic seems to be very diversified. If somebody has a comprehensive chart for these words, I would be very grateful if I could see it, since there are so many interrogative words.
As touched upon in another thread, there are several nouns that exhibit a kind of vowel shift in older forms, where the ending vowel is fronted when the noun is used on its own to become /i/ or /e/, compared to unfronted vowel forms /u/ or /o/ or /a/ when the noun is used in a compound.  Examples include:天: あま vs. あめ (also for 雨)天照{あまてらす}雨合羽{あまがっぱ}上: うわ vs. うえ上着{うわぎ}金: かな vs. かね金槌{かなづち}金屋{かなや}神: かむ vs. かみ  神上{かむあ}がる神所{かむどころ}黄: く vs. き黄金{くがね}口: くつ vs. くち轡{くつわ} from 口{くつ} + 輪{わ}木: こ vs. き木漏{こも}れ日{び}声: こわ vs. こえ声色{こわいろ}手: た vs. て袂{たもと} from 手{た} + 本{もと}手折{たお}る月: つく vs. つき月読{つくよみ}火: ほ vs. ひ炎{ほのお} from 火{ほ}の穂{ほ}火中{ほなか}目: ま vs. め瞬{まばた}き from 目{ま} + 叩{はた}く瞼{まぶた} from 目{ま} + 蓋{ふた}Now for the questions.Does anyone have a list of all nouns known to exhibit this kind of vowel shiftDid all nouns in ancient Japanese or proto-Japanese exhibit this vowel shiftIf it were only some nouns, were these nouns categorizable as any clear class of nouns  As an example of a noun class, there are inseparable nouns in Polynesian languages, which generally cover things like body parts and spiritually important terms, much like many of the Japanese vowel-shift nouns that I'm aware of.Is there any clear membership in 甲類 or 乙類 for these nouns, as compared to similar nouns that don't exhibit any vowel shift  One example is 上 kami1 with the 甲類 み and that doesn't have any kamu form, vs. 神 kami2 with the 乙類 み and that does have a kamu form. What research is there into this phenomenon  Are there any specific titles or authors that cover thisOne theory I've read about (possibly in Shibatani's The Languages of Japan, which I've since misplaced) is that these nouns, when used in standalone contexts, were appended with the now-obsolete Old Japanese い, an emphatic nominalizing particle.  Over time, this fused with the preceding vowel to produce vowel fronting.  As evidence for this, the term カムイ appears in Ainu as a possible borrowing from pre-Old Japanese, before any such sound fusion, clearly manifesting a distinct む and a distinct い sound.Another theory that I've only come up with on my own is that this might be somehow related to verb conjugations, where the 連用形{れんようけい} always ends in either /i/ or /e/.  Verb stems, when used as nouns, always use the 連用形, at least in modern Japanese.  Perhaps this is a reflection of some phonetic constraint or requirement in an ancient stage of the language, that is also reflected in these standalone noun forms
Things I've seen go with 降{ふ}る are rain, snow and leaves, e.g. 雪が降る。I'm thinking 降る is used for small and light things. So, perhaps 'feathers' could be used like so 羽が降る, but apples would be りんごが落{お}ちる。Appreciate your responses. Thanks!
The complete phrase is: 「日本中で、ばえていくけん！」.With the けん at the end, I thought it might have been something from a Kyushu dialect, but the person who said this is from Tottori.The only part I'm really having trouble with is the verb 「ばえていく」. I tried looking up ばえる and ばう as potential verb roots, but they don't seem to exist.  Has anyone every heard of this
Would the following be a good translation of the text in the above two speech bubbles"Everything in this universe is composed of atoms. Destroying  something is equivalent to destroying the atoms that compose it"Also, I'm especially interested in knowing if the Japanese text is implying that atoms are completely destroyed/annihilated or if the atoms are separated or pulverized (but not literally/completely destroyed). I'm having troubles on my own... =/Here is a transcription of the two speech bubbles, in case you can't see the images:「この  　大宇宙にあるもの  　すべてが  　原子でできている  　のよ」「いい　破壊する  　ということの  　根本は　原子を  　くだく  　ということなの」
"寿司屋" means just a "sushi restaurant". I've heard "お寿司屋さん" spoken a few times. As far as I know, only a person's name can be suffixed with "さん". So, is "お寿司屋さん" a personification
tl;drThe word 予習 is strange to me.  Is its usage related to cultural difference  Does the user's knowledge of the material have something to do with itI've always had trouble understanding what exactly 予習 is, and some of the definitions I've seen appear contradictory to my American English mind and words I'm familiar with.  Here are some of the definitions I have in various dictionaries.EnglishPreparation(s) for one's lessons日本語前もって学習することまだならっていないところを前もって学習・練習しておくことCulturalAt first I was thinking maybe this was a cultural difference.  I have a hard time seeing how 予習 is really different (conceptually) from [復習]{ふく・しゅう, «さらい»} ("reviewing").  If today's lesson was on topic X, and tomorrow's lesson is also on topic X, then the 学習 that I do concerning X in the time between today's lesson and tomorrow's lesson is just going over information about X again.  To me, it seems pretty straight-forward that this is "review", so I would use 復習.However, if today's lesson was on topic X, but I know tomorrow's lesson will be about topic Y, saying that I'm going to study up on Y before the teacher even teaches it to us is not something that average American student would do.  (Note that I use "average student" because a small minority of students in public schools, or students in elite/private schools may actually do this.  Which may indicate something about our educational system in America...)  To study beforehand about an unlearned topic seems more in line with the east-Asian (Japan, China, South Korea) mentality where educational discipline is strict, calculated, and expected.  So that's to say that it makes sense to me that a Japanese student would be expected to study topic Y for tomorrow's lesson (before the teacher even teaches it), whereas it would be expected that an American student would be the exact opposite, i.e., if I haven't learned it yet, I'm gonna play video games/sports/whatever-other-leisure once my homework and reviews of X are done.  So in this sense, 予習 has no relevance in the (again, average) American educational mindset.ComprehensionWhen I saw some other definitions for 復習, I thought the difference between it and 予習 might be something else.  Here is a 国語 definition of 復習:一度習ったことを繰り返して勉強することLooking at this definition compared to the one for 予習 above, it seems like more of a difference between things you have learned (一度習ったこと) versus things you have not yet learned (まだならっていないところ).  So if the action is the same (studying the topic), is the choice between 予習 and 復習 simply a matter of if you've learned it yet or not  If so, this is easily confusing since I think most English speakers would use the word "review" to study up on things they've never learned (possibly for lack of a corresponding word).  For example, if I were taking a trip to a country I've never been to, I would still say that I'm going to "review" materials (websites, travel books, etc.) about that country, even though I currently know nothing about it.So if this is the case, is 予習 more akin to a "pre-review"What's the verdictSo is 予習 strange to me because of possible cultural differences  Or is it about the person's assumed knowledge of the topic  Some combination of the two  Something else completely
This is somewhat related to the discussion of classical auxiliary verb ふ, mentioned in the answer to snailboat's question, What is the わ in 忌まわしい and 嘆かわしい.Another apparent iterative / repetitive ending that I've bumped into is る, attaching not to the 未然形【みぜんけい】 but instead to the old 終止形【しゅうしけい】.  This suffix shows up much less often.  Examples that come to mind are まく・まくる and むく・むくる, but I think there may be a few more that escape me at the moment.  According to Shogakukan's Kokugo Dai Jiten dictionary, this form appears to have evolved from the classical 連体形【れんたいけい】, formed by adding る onto the 終止形【しゅうしけい】 for 二段{にだん} and 一段{いちだん} verbs (both 下{しも} and 上{かみ}).  (I almost listed あく・あくる above, but I realized that あくる here is still restricted to 連体-only usage.)  Does anyone have any information on the process whereby this 連体形 form evolved into an apparent iterative/repetitive  Alternatively, does anyone have any explicit explanation of this formation and its semantic uses
Here is a sentence from the children's story ももたろう, describing when the child appears from within the giant peach.桃の中から赤ちゃんが出てきました。My dictionary lists 出て来る as meaning "to come out" with a note that it is a "special class, kuru verb."  It also separately lists 出る as capable of meaning "to come forth."What does using 出て来る accomplish over just using 出るI originally read 出て来る as two separate words: the て form of 出る + 来る, translating it as "exited and came." Is that essentially the etymology of 出て来る  Is 出て来る merely an idiom that my dictionary happens to list as a separate word
What word should I use in informal speech for connecting cause and effect just like から does in polite form
I've chosen the name a bit at random, but for reason I don't understand I have trouble hearing the initial r-sound on several of my male Japanese students' names. Two examples chosen someone at random: 隆介 and 綾They say りゅうせすけ and りょう but I hear ゆうすけ and ようI'm a native English speaker of American English but also had experience hearing German as a child in Germany. Is there some linguistic issue going on here or do I just need to get my ears checkedI saw this question: Utterance initial [ɾ] which explains some of the mouth position for the sound. But, it doesn't answer what I'm asking.
How do you say pork loin in Japanese Jisho.org says it should be ロース, but it seems too vague since I want to use it in a recipe. What about 豚ロース肉
During Q&amp;A in English, "well" and "uhm" are two ways to begin a reply.  If you known the answer, you begin the reply with "Well... ". This creates a pause such that the speaker can arrange his thoughts and construct the clearest answer with good sentence structures. If you aren't sure of the answer, but want to guess anyway, you begin with "uhm...".In Japanese, my opinion is that it's natural to begin a response to a question about which you are unsure of with "あの、... blah blah.".But, how do you begin to reply to a question about which you are confident While I do know the answer, I want a pause so that I can arrange my thoughts. If I lead with "あの", it could look like I am taking a guess.
I noticed this on few occasions. Unfortunately, I can't remember exact situations.I want to clarify if どうも in a role of 'hello' is a shortened version of some longer phrase or just a phrase on its own. When is it okay to use it Does it have any hidden nuance
Here is the sentence :てめえの罠にまんまとかかってやる。Does まんまと means that the speaker fell into the trap easily or voluntarily Or is the idea that he is willing to fall into the trap only contained in てやるThanks for your time.EDIT : The speaker says that after being convinced by the hearer (which he just beat) to let him evolve in order to make the fight interesting. Taking the risk of becoming weaker than his opponent in the process.
I've encountered those two words in a manga I'm currently reading. Here are the sentences :きさまとならまちがいなく勝てるぞ。I don't know if となら is a specific particle or if it is と+なら(ば) (and in that case is と related to まちがう　or 勝てる)てめえの罠にまんまとかかってやる。完全体とやらになるがいい。I suspect とやら is related to the やら particle and has a meaning close to など... but I have seen somewhere that it is equivalent to one of the uses of the quotation marks in english. Like : You pissed on the rug again! - No I didn't my love, it was the dog! - Right, "the dog"...
A sentence from an article on Bitcoin in Asahi Shimbun:それが世界｛せかい｝で１兆｛ちょう｝から７千億円｛せんおくえん｝相当｛そうとう｝も流通｛りゅうつう｝している。I guess it can be translated into:The value of those (bitcoins) circulating all over the world ranges between 0.7 and 1.0 trillion Japanese yen.It appears very uncommon to me to put the bigger number before 「から」when setting a range. Is this case simply a minor exception Or am I missing some important pointBonus question:The corresponding item in スーパー大辞林 seems to be:(3)範囲{はんい}を表｛あらわ｝す｡｢…から…まで｣の形｛かたち｝をとることが多｛おお｝い｡｢小学校｛しょうがっこう｝―大学｛だいがく｝まで首席｛しゅせき｝で通｛とお｝した｣｢何｛なに｝―何｛なに｝までお世話｛せわ｝になりました｣It implies that, when manifesting a range, 「まで」can be, or even must be, omitted in some cases. But in what cases
A line (highlighted) from an anime named 「あの日見た花の名前を僕達はまだ知らない。」:めんま「めんまもじんたん好きー」じんたん「好きだって、友だちの好きとか、それだけじゃねえからな」めんま「わかってるよ、お嫁さんにしたいの好きでしょ？」I guess「お嫁さんにしたいの好き」is said to contrast with「友だちの好き」above. However, the structure of 用言+の＋好き sounds kind of uncommon to me. In most cases I would expect a 「ほど」or「くらい」instead of a「の」here.So the question is:How productive is the usage of the 「の」hereHow weird are「手を握ったの親しい」「消えてもらいたいの嫌い」etc.
I'm reading a novel 「キッチン」by 吉本ばなな at the moment and I noticed that she uses ゆく in some places as an auxiliary verb to signify the action progression from here or from now (if my understanding is correct). I can quote two examples:雨に覆われた夜景が闇ににじんでゆく大きなガラス、に映る自分と目が合う。[...] はるかに淡い空に薄い雲がゆっくりと流れてゆく。So far in my study of Japanese I have encountered いく used this way. Can ゆく be used the same way Will those sentences have the same meaning if ゆく was replaced by いく Is ゆく commonly used this way in modern Japanese
Rikaisama's definition of 先 includes meanings like previous; prior; former; some time ago. However it also includes meanings such as front; ahead; the future; destination. I am struggling to make sense of when to apply each meaning since it seems to me that they are pretty much the two sides of the same coin in one word. There's also 先に which can mean before; earlier than / ahead; beyond, among others.I've noticed that if the meaning has to do with the past, the subsequent verb is in the past tense. This is a good starting point, but it doesn't always help me. Am I forced to learn each usage of 先 individually or is there some "rule" to the word that would help me identify it's meanings in different contextsThank you in advance.
A sentence (highlighted below) from Asahi Shimbun:その父の愛情表現は荒っぽかった。娘が父の事務所に顔を出すと、「おお、来たか！」というなり、娘の頭をヘッドロックのように抱きかかえた。父から「愛情の洪水が押し寄せる」ため、話したいことも話せないまま短い面会時間は終わるのだったWithout any adverbs (e.g. いつも), how can it be decided whether the sentence is talking about a single occurrence or multiple ones Is there a default value or does it simply depends on the context
I remember hearing this idiom which meant someone was so lowly, they were not even considered a person. I don't know the source, but remember it was referred to as a 'common Japanese idiom'.Unfortunately, I can't seem to find it or its origin online. Is this not really an idiom What is its source
I have trained for 25 years with a local (European) Aikido master, but now I have to move, albeit temporarily, to another town, and I would like to give a gift to my teacher to represent the "debt" I have with him for all he taught me.I also practice Shodo, so my idea was to make a scroll with the Kanji "義理" and give it to him before leaving.I just want to add that I will keep practicing at another dojo in the place I move to, and that I may very well come back to my hometown in a year or so, just so that you get a complete picture.My question: is "義理" appropriate here If this is not the case what would you suggest I opted for "礼" in the end - thanks to everyone who answered or commented this.
My circle (student club) at a Japanese university is preparing for the school festival. One option for participating is to draw and submit a 「ジャンルくじイラスト」. Does this translate to "genre lottery illustration"What does that mean  Does it mean that each submitted illustration is not guaranteed to be featured in the festival booth, but that the illustrations used in the festival will be selected out of all of the submitted illustrations by random  Or does it mean that the genres to choose from for drawing the illustration were determined by lottery  Or...Here is the full paragraph:「ジャンルくじイラスト募集要項　　ジャンルが書かれたくじを引いてそれに書かれたジャンルのイラストを書く、ジャンルくじイラスト企画を今年も行います。くじを引く人は例会、その他の場所で学祭担当が対応します。参加は各自の自由。」The rules also state,「デリケートなジャンルに関しては各自自重する（ディズニーとか）」. What is デリケートなジャンル, and what is 各自自重するI Googled デリケートなジャンル but could not determine a basic definition that seemed to apply to the various webpages that came up.  What constitutes a genre as "delicate"  I tried looking up 各自自重する in online dictionaries but I could not find an English translation.  Is this saying that if you want to draw Disney characters you need to make them original in some way  Is it possibly saying that fanart is not allowedThank you very much!
I was learning about adjectives + さ, which turns them into a noun; as I understand it, a "measurable" quantity .  I then thought of how X そうです could be turned into an adjective, X　そうな Y, so I was wondering whether if さ could also be applied here.  If so, is this something actively used in the language  If not, what sort of limitations does さ have in general that prevents such an usage
I know 方 can be used for constructions with verbs' ta forms, but can it also be use with things like nouns, adjectives, etc.  My understanding previously was that it was all the same word, but should you write "hou" differently, depending on whether you're using it for a verb or for something elseそのほうがいいその方がいい行かない方がいい
When using a "te wa ikenai" construction, do you have to write "ikenai" without kanji, or can you use 行For example:働かなくてはいけないvs:働かなくては行けないMy understanding was that the idiom was that such and such "cannot go" (almost like if you tell somebody in English that something "won't fly"), but are you resigned to not using kanji
In the lyrics of a song by Utada Hikaru I came across two lines (starting from 0:40) saying:開いたばかりの花が散るのを見ていた木立の遣る瀬無きかなMy questions:How to explain the 「の」 in the second lineI guess the 「かな」at the end is sort of an exclamation, then how can the 「遣る瀬無き」right before it be not modifying any noun phrase as in 「遣る瀬無き恋」　Why was「遣る瀬無し」or「遣る瀬無さ」not opted for here
I have a sentence that I'm having some trouble with. It's from a game called Tales of Graces -- basically, at one point you go to a garden and grab one of these rare flowers from there. The sentence is the description that is displayed when you view the flower in your inventory.裏山の花畑へ行った証拠にと、摘んだ花。Something like "A flower that proves you went to the garden out on the hill", right I get the gist of the sentence, but I'm not clear on what function にと has after 証拠. Is it a combination of the particles に and と Does this combination carry any significant nuance
In the "ことがあります" construction about past experiences, when is "事" used, and when is "こと" usedThe textbook used in class uses "こと":六本木の おんせんに 行った ことがあります。If it wanted to use "事" instead of "こと", it could have, as that kanji was taught in the same lesson. (Lesson 5 of "Japanese for Busy People II", revised 3rd edition)However, Wiktionary says that the kanji form can be used, and "事があります" gets some hits in the Tanaka corpus on jisho.orgWhen is "事" used, and when is "こと" used
I've been reading よつばと！ and I'm on a chapter where Fuuka has a crush on a guy. She says this:手ぇつないで歩いてたのI assume the small e is just for emphasis/extension and it doesn't seem to serve a grammatical function (though I'd like to know that for sure), but that's not what poses a problem for me. I have no idea what つないで means. I can't find a definition for it, nor can I for つなぐ, つる, or つある, all of which it is possible inflections of. Can somebody define this for me

Since my flight home from Japan is soon approaching I thought I had better learn the word for "flight".It seems to be one of those words that has several Japanese equivalents. I'd like to know the usage and nuance differences between them, and which is most practical to learn first for a beginner (not too difficult, rare, technical, outdated, etc)Here are the terms I've found so far:飛行{ひこう} - My intuition is that this is the one I should prefer, but I could be biased against loanwords from English.便{びん} - Wiktionary says this means "booked flight", which doesn't rule it out. Being a single character it's harder for a beginner to look for examples. Single character words usually have other readings and other senses.フライト - This is obviously a loanword from English, does it convey anything new that the more traditional-looking kanji terms don't飛{とび} - Being a single character makes this hard for a beginner to look into, but my impression is that even with this reading it's too ambiguous and probably isn't used so much for people talking about air travel.I would be looking for a term that I could use in sentences equivalent to:I've booked my flight.I have a flight home on the 22nd.I hope I don't miss my flight.
I know the basic usage of it, e.g. これから (thing the speaker wants to do), but there are some contexts where the usage doesn't seem to make any sense, like when someone just says it by itself.Anyone have any ideas
新しい大学のビルが建てられた。新しい大学のビルを建てました。Both translate to: A new university building was built.Even though the translation is the same (by my understanding) something to do with the meaning has to be different. I know the first sentence is passive form, the other you're everyday form (sorry, don't know what its proper name is) but I can't figure out what the difference is. I'm sure the different particles of が and を have something to do with it.
The sentence is :　まあ　何人来ようが　||　どうってこともないがな...         (|| = Column break.)It doesn't matter how many people want to come...I'm not sure whether the first が is the subject particle (and if it can even be used right after a volitional form) or the clause ending particle...The way I understand it the structure is "[How many people want to come] is not something that matters." Am I rightBonus point : I'm not sure whether the volitional form should be translated as "want to come" or "will come" (though, from what I know, most of the time だろう is used instead of ~おう to speak of the future).
Can't really understand this form:I've seen already this form with 考える and translated it like this:  考えうることだ - conceivable (possible)However how do you translate with other verbs is this some kind of potential1.人生の目的は何かという問題に対してみんなが納得しうる答えを出すのは難しい。

The sentence is from a manga in which the character, after saying this :オレの細胞がてめえみたいなみにくいバケモノに使われているなんてショックだぜ。What a shock that my cells were used for an ugly monster like you.Says this :もうすこしなんとかならんかったもんかね...The translations I have are along the line of "It could have become something better." "I wish a better job had been done."I know that もうすこし can mean "a bit more" or "a bit longer", can it mean "a bit better" tooFrom what I know ものか is used to strongly state the opposite of what precedes it like :知るもんか！How the hell would I know ; No idea! ; I don't care!Assuming I'm right, I don't get how ならんなかったもんか can be translated as "could become"...EDIT :Or is it along the line of :There is no way (もんか） that somehow (なんとか) it did not become (ならなかった) a bit better (もうすこし).

There appears to be some disagreement/confusion about the precise meaning of セレブ - some dictionaries claim that セレブ means the same thing as English "celebrity", while others claim that it just means "rich person". デジタル大辞泉 basically says it means the same as "celebrity" - a famous person. 著名人。名士。セレブリティー。語源由来辞典 suggests that while it can mean "famous person", it is also frequently used to refer to a "beautiful woman" or a "rich person".セレブとは、名士。有名人。女性誌などでは、知名度に関係なく、美しく優雅で知的な女性を意味したり、お金持ちをさすことが多い。The explanation on Japanese Wikipedia also says that セレブ implies things like "rich", "refined", and "posh" (albeit this section lacks sources).日本のテレビや雑誌メディアはセレブと略し、金持ち、優雅な、高級な、などの意味合いで使用している。Given that this word is a relatively recent import from English (late '90s, according to 語源由来辞典), I'm guessing that there's still some variation in the way it's used. In any case, what I would like to know is - how is セレブ typically used these days Does it mean "celebrity", or does it mean "rich person", or can it mean both, or what
Why do the verbs 為る【する】 and 為す【なす】 ("to do") use the same kanji as 為【ため】 ("because of", "for the sake of", etc.) I'm not seeing any obvious connection between the meanings of する・なす and ため that would explain why they use the same kanji, and they don't appear to be etymologically related either. (Yes, I'm aware that nobody writes する or なす with those kanji, but that's how it's listed in dictionaries, so I figure it's worth asking anyway.)

Some speakers of Japanese pronounce 場合【ばあい】 as ばわい. Do those speakers also pronounce similar /Caai/ words like 他愛【たあい】 and 間合い【まあい】 differently (I've seen たわいない listed as an alternate reading for 他愛ない, but not たわい for 他愛.)I can't think of any longer words that have -aai(-), but if there are any, would people who say ばわい also pronounce those words with -awai(-)
While looking up some grammar points I stumbled across this paper which describes something that it calls "indirect passives". I can't think of anything similar in English, and I'm having trouble understanding how it works. It seems that this involves using a passive-voice verb in a sentence that specifies different agents and indirect objects/agents. The paper gives several examples, including the following:Taroo-ga kodomo-ni nak-are-ta. (太郎が子供に泣かれた)"Taro was adversely affected by the child's crying."Taroo-ga tuma-ni taore-rare-ta. (太郎が妻に倒れられた)"Taro was in trouble because his wife got sick in bed."Hanako-ga tonari-no gakusei-ni piano-o asa-made hik-are-ta. (花子が隣の学生にピアノを朝まで弾かれた)"Hanako was adversely affected by the neighboring student's playing the piano until morning."I suppose that these sentences could be perhaps ungrammatically translated into English as something like the following:Taro was cried by the child.Taro was collapsed by his wife.Hanako was played the piano until morning by the neighboring student.But what is it about this grammatical construction that infers a negative outcome Especially the last example, which does make sense in English but doesn't seem to suggest anything negative in English.Could anyone provide an explanation on how this pattern works
I understand the dictionary definition of 惣菜: 日常のおかず。副食物。Basically, "a thing you frequently eat as an accompaniment to rice; a [non-staple] side dish". Practically speaking, though, I don't quite get what kinds of things one would call a 惣菜. I have a sense for what kinds of things are おかず, but not what things are 日常のおかず, so some clarification about what sorts of things are considered 日常のおかず / 惣菜 would help.
I've noticed a grammar pattern recently: 「Ｖ方{ほう}もＶ方{ほう}だ」.  From what I can tell, it always repeats the same verb twice, and it seems like ほう is often written in kana:行くほうも行くほうだAnd if it's a する verb, usually only する repeats:質問するほうもするほうですBut I can't find it in any of my reference materials—the dictionaries on my EX-WORD, the Makino et al. grammar dictionaries, or in Martin.  I can find lots of examples online, but my poor brain just can't make sense of them:作るほうも作るほうだが、売るほうも売るほうだ。加えて、買うほうもまた買うほうだと思っていた。そんなときに全く偶然に入ったお店がこの店だった。(from a blog post found on Google)I guess ほう is 方, but I'm not sure how to interpret it or why it repeats.  What does Ｖ方{ほう}もV方{ほう}だ mean

How could I write about something in the future where something will have happened That is, I'm writing from the perspective of the current time, about a perspective in the future where something has happened between the two perspectives.My specific case right now is to get the equivalent of "If you are reading this, I will already be dead" in Japanese.Currently I'm thinking of 「これを読んでいるなら、私はもう死んでいました」, but that seems to translate more to "If you are reading this, I am already dead", that is, the perspective for it is in the future, but I want to write in the present."If you are reading this, I will already be dead" ⟵ this"If you are reading this, I am already dead" ⟵ not thisSince this is a bit hard to understand, here's a drawing to explain what I want to do:Time ───────────────┬────────────────────┬────────────────┬─────────────&gt;        Now (Writing the letter)       I die        Letter is read                    └────────────────┐   └────────────────│────────────────┐                       Writing from here, talking about this, referencing this event@YangMuye suggested turning it into a question: 「あなたがこれを読んでいるなら、私はもう死んでいるでしょう。」Would this be the best way to do itWhile also helping me with my specific case, please also give a general answer to the question in case people need to apply it to other sentences such as, "In the future, androids will have been created", or "At the heat death of the universe, all black holes will have evaporated" (Yes, I'm bad at examples)
I'm in the planning stages of programming my own Katakana =&gt; Romaji converter. However, I've noticed that every other converter already out there just converts literally. I want to try and employ a more "intelligent" converter (note that the end result will be a default, the user will be able to tweak the transliteration if they so choose)As an example, have this name of a character from one of my stories: ネックススConverters will give the result: Nekkususu... but nobody who isn't familiar with Romaji would read that as Nexus...So I'm trying to figure out some rules for better transliteration. So far, I have the following:The substring kkus can be replaced with xA u at the end is most likely silent and can be dropped (these two rules already "fix" Nexus)Tu is better as Tsu, and Ti as Chi.However, that's where my knowledge ends. What I'd like to know is, for starters, are the above three rules correct Are there exceptions I should be aware of Are there other rules that could make my converter more accurateAs mentioned before, perfection isn't required because the user may adjust the result, but I would feel better about the feature if it at least made an effort.
I would like to know if there is a word (in either Japanese or English) that describes pairs of words that are spelled the same in kana. For example, 橋 and 箸 would be "homo-kana" words, because they are both spelled はし. I'm not looking for the word homograph / 同綴異義語【どうてついぎご】. The term homograph would apply to pairs like 一日【いちにち】 and 一日【ついたち】, which are written identically, but have different meanings (I know this isn't a great example, since 一日【いちにち】 and 一日【ついたち】 are obviously related, but I haven't come up with anything better). The example I gave above (橋・箸) is an example of a pair of heterographs that are "homo-kana" words. I'm also not looking for the word homophone / 同音異義語【どうおんいぎご】: words that are written the same in kana need not be pronounced the same, because of pitch accent. Again, 橋 and 箸 are not homophones (in 標準語 anyway) but are still "homo-kana" words. I suppose I could just say something to the effect of 「『橋』と『箸』のカナ表記が同じ」, but I feel like this is the sort of thing for which a technical term would have been developed.

I realized I didn't know the Japanese word for the concept which has three very interchangeable words: "kind", "sort", and "type".By looking in my usual resources such as WWWJDIC, English Wiktionary, and Googling, I found three candidates for the Japanese word or words I should use for this:分類{ぶんるい}種類{しゅるい}類い{たぐい}Each has at least some other functions, just as each of the three English words do. But for this function are they equivalent, is one or the other not really this meaning, too rare or technical, etc, or have a missed altogether a better term for this jobHere's some random uses I found via Google to illustrate the common sense I have in mind:not that kind of girlWhat kind of man are youThese aren't the sort of things you imagine happening to someone like you.The Bunker Diary is the sort of book you just want to talk about for ages.This book will tell you what type of work environment you need.The health care provider will choose the best type of insulin for you ...
From what I understand the volitional form is often used to mean "let's do" something, e.g. 行こう can mean "let's go". Can this form be use when the speaker themself is not going to perform the action For example, in English a teacher might say, "Let's all do well on the test tomorrow!", even though she isn't actually going to take the test herself (my Japanese is terrible, but something like 「明日は試験を退けよう！」) Could you use the volitional form in this caseA second, similar question, if you don't mind. Could the volitional form be used in a case where neither the speaker or the listener will perform the action Such as in a science documentary, when the narrator might say something like "Let's try mixing sulphuric acid with sugar", even though the actual mixing is not being done by the narrator or the viewer.Thank you!

As far as I know, one can say "I started doing X" by adding X-はじめました。　However, I don't think this applies to "to like", which is an adjective. So how to say for example "I started liking science"
For example, if I were in a situation where I said something and it was misunderstood (maybe because of bad Japanese), what would be the best way to attempt to correct myselfIn English one could say, "Sorry, I meant ..."e.g., Saying, 「これは兄がもらった贈り物だ」(This is the present my brother got) when you meant, 「これは兄にもらった贈り物だ」(This is the present I got from my brother), and you want to tell them this correction after the other party has replied.What would be the equivalent phrase to use when correcting somebody elseIn English it could be, "Did you mean ... " or, "I think you mean ..."e.g., Someone says to you, 「これは兄が私に上げた贈り物だ」 and you want to correct them to say, 「これは兄がくれた贈り物だ」 (presuming they didn't know they made this mistake)
e.g. はなすこと and はなしかたI am trying to learn about this grammar point for a test My notes for できます and わかります
I know the difference in meaning between the two: できます being "to be able to" or "can do", and わかります being "to understand how to" or "to know". I also know a simple sentence structure for both: "Person は Noun が (できます/わかります)" However, I can't understand which one to use in a sentence. Especially with the use of dictionary form verbs and こと in place of the noun. I am trying to learn about this grammar point for a test and I just don't understand them. Here is an image of my notes so you see exactly what I'm seeing:
Is しゃぶしゃぶ typically written in hiragana rather than katakana If so, why is it written in hiragana Wikipedia says that it is onomatopoeia:The term is an onomatopoeia, derived from the sound emitted when the  ingredients are stirred in the cooking pot.And I thought that onomatopoeia was typically done in katakana (though the latter citation gives some exceptions).

Sentence 1 - mostly I don't get 多くの自然が. Many nature  Much of nature Nothing really seems to fit.Sentence 2 - I just don't understand the whole flow of the sentence. I think not understanding によって is one issue. Because of perhaps And the "nature like this" I don't get. Etc etc.Sentence 3 - I feel pretty confident about this one.Sentence 4 - I think my main issues are not seeing the function of やって and not understanding how the か and どう are used together.Any hints would be much appreciated.
I have the following sentence to translate.日本はカリフォルニア州と同じぐらいの大きさでほとんどのヨーロッパの国々より大きいということはあまり知られていないI am having trouble translating the second half. Japan is about the same size as the state of California andas for it being bigger than most European countries, it is not (being) known very well.Can anyone offer any hints about what the author is trying to say
As far as I am aware, すぐに means "immediately", but in which contexts can you use もうすぐ and すぐ？
I looked up the etymology of　古【いにしえ】 on gogen-allguide, and found the following:いにしえは、「去る」を意味する動詞「いぬ（往ぬ）」の連用形「イニ」に、過去を示す助動詞「キ」の連体形「シ」がついた「イニシ」が、方向を表す名詞「ヘ（方）」を修飾した「往にし方（いにしへ）」。This basically says that we take the verb 往ぬ, conjugate it, add the 助動詞 「き」, conjugate again, and finish by adding the noun 方【へ】. This was a bit surprising to me, since I've never seen the noun 方【へ】 myself, and was expecting the particle へ to show up there instead. This is obviously suggestive of some sort of relationship between the noun 方【へ】 and the particle へ. So - what is the etymological relationship between the noun 方【へ】 and the particle へ
こうえんをさんぽします。Why in this sentence do we use を　and not で。
Could somebody please explain me the grammar in ようにと. Is there something omitted between ように and とAs far as I can guess the author is saying something like - "For now I'll try to not think about anything, and continue reading the letter."手紙は続く。いまは何も考えないようにと努め、私は次へと進む。
Can one use 「本日、Xを話したいです」　when opening a speech, or is it too rough For example, translations for the sentence "Today I would like to talk about my past" that I can think of are 「本日、私の過去を話したいです」　or 「本日、私の過去について話したいです」　or　「本日、私の過去について話したいと思います」。 Which of these would be the best, or is there anything better
Translating songs to improve my Japanese, I have quite often come across the expression:このままでThe phrase should mean "in this condition", kono = this, mama = condition, state (shinjitai 侭 or kyūjitai 儘), de = in (postposition). In certain contexts, as in 此の侭でいいんだよ from Stereopony's 涙の向こう (namida no mukō), it is possible to directly use that translation, i.e. "This way it's fine". In other contexts, however, as for example in the refrain of いかないで (here's song and lyrics, where as far as I know "iteta" should be "naiteta"), the given translation doesn't quite fit, as translating the refrain's last few phrases as "Don't go, this way" makes the expression disconnected from the neighbouring "ikanaide". So I am not sure what it means there and how to translate it. I interpreted it as something like "stay with me". What do you recommend
In the following sentence, taken from an article about tatami the transitive and passive verbs (編む＆作る）seem to be combined into one phrase to express what I have said translation but it does not seem to fit any logical grammatical sequence:畳表というのは、畳の表面、つまり人の足が触れる部分で、ここは、イグサという植物の茎を編んで作られています。Tatami-omote is the surface of the tatami mat, in other words the part that comes into contact with people's feet. It is made from rushes woven together.I assume the Japanese (if not my translation) is correct but can somebody explain the logic of what is being described grammaticallyMy best guess is that the passive verb （作られている） is somehow acting on the transitive (編んで） in the same way that ある acts on transitive verbs in expressions such as 「ご飯を作ってあります」(note) but it is my first time to see this and I don't recall it in any text book.Note: を was chosen deliberately in this example to be consistent with my subject sentence.
Recently I wanted to learn the equivalents to the common money-related verbs of English such as buy, pay, sell, and spend.I found two words for "spend" and would like to know what the difference is between them, whether one is better for "to spend money", whether one is common and the other rare, etc:遣{つか}う費{つい}やす
In my time in Japan I've noticed a few kanji that can be used on their own commonly in various kinds of signs, yet I don't think they are also words in their own right:押引危開閉Since all kanji have multiple readings, I keep wondering how native speakers read these, or talk about them.In fact for 危 I'm also interested in what they read it semantically. Is it "dangerous", or "watch out" or "caution" - or does it not really matter until you try to put it into words
I was doing my vocab training and added a few body parts.Then I noticed that the word I had found in the English Wiktionary for "knuckle" seems to be untypable with my Windows Japanese IME.This made me wonder if it's yet another case of learners "using too much kanji", etc. Is this a rare or unusual word, a word usually written in kana, or just a mistake in Wiktionary or of my own making
ごんは、家に着くと、ウナギを家の外に置いて、言いました。In this sentence, a fox called ごん has run all the way home to escape an angry fisherman who he stole an eel from.Why is と the conditional used here I could understand had it been たら because that one is like sequential, but と isn't is itI thought that if you had a conditional with a past tense S2 (Sentence two) then it was meant to indicate a surprising result. What is と doing in this sentenceThankyou
What exactly does な particle mean when used with わけExample (pulled from Google): あいつが犯人なわけがないじゃないか.I know exactly what this sentence means, but I'm just a little unsure on what the な is doing there I couldn't find a suitable answer in my dictionary, the only thing I can thing of is it being another form of だ. Thank you in advance.
I am preparing a speech, and would like to finish it by saying "I hope you found it interesting" or "I hope you found my speech interesting", or similar. However, I am not certain of the different nuances of "hope", nor how to link it with "you liked it". This is not the same as saying "Thank you for listening/attention", which will be added to the end as well.This would be said in a context of a formal speech in a serious context, meant for Japanese teachers and class.
I am not certain how to say "X is the most important for Y". For example, "A teacher is the most important person for a student." It could be 「先生は学生にいちばんたいせつな人です」　or 「がくせいは先生がいちばんたいせつな人です」, but I haven't been able to confirm either (or any other construct) in any way.
In an anime, 龍ヶ嬢七々々 is pronounced as りゅうがじょう ななな. I'm wondering why 七々々 is prounounced as ななな, since 七 is なな, and there are two repeat signs.Is this some sort of special case where 七 is prounounced as just な and hence with the two repeat signs becomes ななな Or am I missing somethingThanks.
小数第２位未満に端数が生じた場合は、小数第３位を四捨五入するI initially translated this sentence to:If a fraction with less than 2 decimal places is generated, round off to 3 decimal places.So: 2.1 ≈ 2.100It felt somewhat off, so I sought for some sample translations for「四捨五入」.JP: 。。。小数点第３位を四捨五入して。。。EN: ...is rounded off to two decimal places...So: 2.1 ≈ 2.10What!Why is it translated this way Does 「四捨五入」 make the decimal places less than the mentioned number or something else entirely How do speakers reconcile this
Can 複合動詞{ふくごうどうし} ever not have [送]{おく}り[仮名]{がな} placed between the 2 kanji in the compound verb？
Is the plain form ever used to give a command What does "sugu ni tatsu" mean
The context is you're casually telling a person where you've worked in the past.I was thinking something like: IBMで働いた or IBMで仕事した.But it didn't seem right. In English, the conversation would go something like:A: Where did you used to workB: I've worked for IBM. And also, I've worked at Best Buy.
I noticed that some (most all) words that were borrowed from English and end with -er in English can have either short or long vowel at the end:browser - can be ブラウザ or ブラウザーdriver - can be ドライバ or ドライバーcomputer - can be コンピュータ or コンピューターIs one option preferred over another There doesn't seem to be much consistency so is just a matter of personal choice Dictionaries usually list both options so that doesn't offer much help.
I ran across 臨海学校{りんかいがっこう} in a manga (ときめきトゥナイト) and I'm unsure what the exact meaning is. All the online dictionaries I've checked translate it as "seaside school", which doesn't quite make sense to me. To me that means literally a school by the sea, but in the story, it seems more special since the students are taking a trip and spending a couple days there. The teacher says this to the students:3泊4日の臨海学校だがな
I came across the following sentence:「…あの犯行予告、俺がやったんじゃないんだけどな。」I also have English subtitles which translate this phrase as:"I wasn't the one who issued that threat, but no matter."What's the difference between んじゃない and んだ as they're used hereOne would ordinarily expect んじゃない to be the negative of んだ. If that were true, then the above sentence would be invoking the explanation modality* twice. But it seems that instead んじゃない has an entirely unrelated meaning.I've found comparison questions to be among the most helpful in stack exchange(e.g. What is the difference between SOAP and RESTful ). So what I'm looking for is their definitions in relation to each other(to the extent that they can be related). And how does this difference enable them to be used together as in the above sentence*(I think that's what it's called...) Edit:Changed title from What does ～んじゃないんだ mean"
I'm working my way through the core 2000, and came across this:[明日]{あす}、6[時]{じ}に[起]{お}こしてください。I immediately thought, "Please wake up at 6am tomorrow." But the translation in the deck instead says, "Please wake me up tomorrow at six o'clock."How would I know who the indirect object (the person being woken up) is Shouldn't "wake me up" be preceded by [私]{わたし}に or similar
I am translating a guidebook for a Legend of Zelda game, for study purposes. I'm finding a variety of new phrases and words, but this one has me stumped.This is in the introduction to a section 冒険のヒント (Adventure Hints):冒険の途中で困ったときに思い出してほしい。  At the time when you’re worried in the middle of the adventure [you will] wish to remember [these hints &amp; advice].解決の糸口になるかも・・・    It must mean something like "the resolution to this might be beginning below" but that is just my guess. Could somebody help me out with an explanation please
芥川龍之介's story 片恋 begins with the following sentence:一しょに大学を出た親しい友だちの一人に、ある夏の午後[京浜電車]{けいひんでんしゃ}の中で[遇]{あ}ったら、こんな話を聞かせられた。Perhaps because 聞く can mean both "to hear" and "to ask", and also because of the causative conjugation of the verb, I'm not too sure of the correct interpretation of 友だちに〜聞かせられた. Would anyone be able to provide some clarification on how to parse this word My guess would be to translate the passage as follows:I heard this story one summer afternoon from a close friend with whom I had attended university, after we bumped into each other aboard a train from Yokohama.聞かせられた appears to mean "was caused to hear". Is this as circumlocutious in Japanese as it would be in English Could 聞かれた or 聞いた be used instead
I am getting a bit confused with the multiple uses of でも. Permission, even if, without doing, etc. I have the following 2 sentences to translate. Note - these sentences might not be validSentence 1わからないでも言って下さいSentence 2二時間おきでもいいですI think they mean the following. Sentence 1Please say it without understanding. Sentence 2Even every 3 hours is okay. Are these sentences valid, and if so, are my translations correct
Capitalized letters look like I'M SHOUTING AT YOU.How would you reproduce this effect in JapaneseI don't think any of the obvious choices,using カタカナ instead of 漢字 or ひらがな,using punctuation, e.g. brackets 「」『』etc.using bold facequite make the mark.Does that mean I CAN'T SHOUT AT YOU IN JAPANESE !!!
We observe the following peculiar apparent relations between the conjugation patterns of 形容詞 and 動詞 (using 赤し and 行く as examples):連体形: 赤き / 行きし (past recollective)終止形: 赤し / 行きき (past recollective)連用形: 赤く / 行き連体形: 赤き / 行くIn both of these cases we have an apparent reversal of two endings across the two parts of speech: き←→し and く←→き.Is there any explanation/etymology behind this, or is this thought to be a coincidence
How can I learn to hear the difference between て and で, た and だ, か and が, etc.For example, when I people say "わたし", it sounds to me like "wa da shi" instead of "wa ta shi". The same things happens in case of か行 and た行. Sometimes it's really hard to distinguish them.
I know how to say "without" when it comes to verbs using 〜ないで.  But I was wondering how to use "without" when it comes to nouns.  For example:I left without my wallet.or I left without my glasses.Sometimes I see なしに or なしで after a noun, and I wonder what the difference between them is and how to use them.  How do I say "without (noun)" using なしに or なしで
It is often said that Newspapers use grammatical forms/ellipses not used elsewhere and, on the whole, these do not present a problem to read and understand.  However the ellipses do not seem to be unique to Newspapers, in particular the dropping of the copular 「だ」 after nouns and "na-adjectives" and 「する」from "suru-verbs" at the end of sentences.For example, 「だ」 appears to be dropped from the end of the following passage attributed to the 宮内庁HP:皇室の一般公開で花見関東地方で桜が見ごろを迎えた４月4日（金曜）から８日（火曜）までにかけて、皇居の中にある「乾通り」{いぬいどおり}が一般公開され、５日間で３８万６０５０人が皇居での花見を楽しんだ。この特別公開は、天皇陛下が昨年１２月２３日に８０歳の傘寿を迎えられた記念として実施されたもの。・・・Reference: 中上級日本語、２０１４年５月版I had concluded from the response to the following question that it was (probably) acceptable to drop 「する」and 「だ」in one's writing as long as one was consistent:Does using the characters です at the end of a sentence make almost everything(depending on the sentence) sound politeBut, is this true....and when can one really use this style Dropping these two words does not seem unique to newspapers (indeed, it seems to exist even in novels).I also note that when I quoted the second "sentence" from the above passage in another question, there was comment that it was not a proper sentence.  I am confused - when can I (indeed, when should I) use these "incomplete sentence" structures
軍艦行進曲 seems to be written mostly using Classical Japanese grammar. Here's the first stanza:守るも攻むるも黒鐵{くろがね}の浮かべる城{しろ}ぞ頼{たの}みなる浮かべるその城{しろ}日{ひ}の本{もと}の皇國{みくに}の四方{よも}を守{まも}るべし眞鐵{まがね}のその艦{ふね}日の本に仇{あだ}なす國{くに}を攻{せ}めよかしDetails like using the 連体形 なる in combination with ぞ, べし, 連体形 as a nominal in the first sentence, etc seem to be correct CJ grammar, and are more than the token き ending for adjectives and なり randomly thrown in J-pop songs so often. Obviously を and その are used in a very modern way, but most people aren't very familiar with を's old sense either.However, 浮かべる stands out like a huge sore thumb to me. Clearly it should be 浮{うか}ぶる, the 連体形 of 浮{うか}ぶ The song even gets 攻むる correct, and using 浮{うか}ぶる wouldn't disturb the meter in any way.Is there some sort of reason, or is this just a random artistic choice Usually songs are full of Modern Japanese and throw in Classical grammar for effect. This song is full of Classical gramamr and throws in a fragment of Modern grammar, for...effectDid 浮{うか}ぶ have an 一段 variant
So I know that おそい, ちこく, and おくれる all can mean late. But I don't know what context to use which in. Can I just swap おそくなります, ちこくする, and おくれる at will
デジタル大辞泉 defines しめしめ as follows: 物事が自分の思ったとおりに運んで、ひそかに喜ぶときに発する語。  「―、思いどおりになった」I get the first part ("When something has gone as you planned for it to go..."), but I'm a bit confused about the usage implied by the latter part ("Something that is said when one is secretly pleased"). The example isn't helping - is しめしめ something that you can just sort of say outside the context of a sentence as an interjection It doesn't appear to be acting adverbially there, at minimum.Like, if I've just... say, solved a math problem, and I'm pleased with myself, could I just say 「しめしめ！」 by itself to express my pleasure
Two of Japan's native wild animals are the きつね fox and たぬき raccoon dog.Interestingly there are also noodle dishes apparently named after each. (Not containing the meat of those animals!)The terms seem to be mostly for うどん udon but occur with other kinds of noodles in Japan such as ramen and soba too.Do we know how these two noodle dishes came to each be named after a Japanese animal Could it be that one animal lives in a part of the country where one style of noodle dish was first popular while the other animal lives in a different part of the country with a different popular noodle dishOr is it based on something else
The Imperial Palace gardens were opened to the public recently  to celebrate the Emperor's 80th birthday. Can someone confirm the use of the passive voice in the following sentence on the subject in context of using the passive form to show respect and addressing the Emperor？（see note below). この特別公開は、天皇陛下が昨年１２月２３日に８０歳の傘寿を迎えられた記念として実施されたもの。Or, in other words, is the passive voice used here to show respect to the Emperor and aren't people supposed to use more elevated language to refer to his activities, or at least お迎えになる which I think is more honorific than the passive Note: example of normal use of 迎える：20歳の誕生日を迎える＝celebrate one's twentieth birthday
Just now in the chat room we came across a reading of the kanji 閉 that seems to be either rare or erroneous.In the English Wiktionary's entry for 閉 there is the following "Readings section":On: へい (hei), へつ (hetsu)Kun: とじる (tojiru), しめる (shimeru), とざす (tozasu)None of us in the chat room at the time could come up with anywhere the へつ is usedIs it a correct reading What is/was it used for
Does ガールフレンド have a meaning of a female friend (like girl friend), or a female romantic partnerSomeone told me it had the former meaning, and I should use "彼女" for a romantic partner. However, the Japanese edition of Wikipedia seems to imply that ガールフレンド means romantic partner, as does the Tanaka corpus. Neither the English nor Japanese edition of Wiktionary have an entry on ガールフレンド.
I've noticed on my travels around Japan that on maps there are two ways of indicating the viewers position in the manner of the English "You are here":現在地{げんざいち} is common on maps in Japan, and seems to be directly from Chinese as I saw it on maps in China and/or Taiwan (possibly with variant characters).現在位置{げんざいいち} is common here in Sapporo and I think elsewhere in Hokkaido, though I first saw it on the ferry from Okinawa to Kagoshima.Now are these both words Or are they phrases Or is it a case of one of each How do I parse them Are there any subtle differences between themI just got reprimanded for adding the longer variant to the English Wiktionary for being "not a word and obviously sum-of-parts". What makes the first good and the second bad Is the first the only one that has entries in dictionariesAt the very least would the second be considered to at least be a set phrase
In English, when we wish to write a non-strict mathematical inequality, we will write something like this:x ≤ 3 or y ≥ 5In Japanese writing, however, I have also seen the symbol ≦ used to mean "less than or equal to". Which of ≤ and ≦ is more common in Japanese usage I would be interested to know about any differences that exist across various media/genres of writing, e.g. news reports vs. scholarly papers vs. textbooks.
In English any verb can be turned into a kind of noun called an "agent noun", that just means the do-er of the action:to drive - driverto walk - walkerto think - thinkerto drink - drinkerYesterday I wanted to communicate the notion "drinker" meaning plainly "one who drinks".My Japanese is not good and the people I was talking with had a similar level of English. So maybe we missed something, but the best they could come up with was words meaning more like "drunk" or "habitual drinker". In English "drinker" could mean this but could also, depending on context, just mean "not a teetotaller" or even refer to a person or thing that drinks, even in non-alcohol senses.The English Wiktionary only lists these two as translations of English -er:者 (...しゃ, -sha)家 (...か, -ka)Others that have been identified by various people reading this question are:手 (...しゅ, -shu)師士員人So could 者 or 家 actually be appended to some form of 飲む to give something similar to the English range of meaning that "drinker" hasAnd really "drinker" is just the real life example. I'm actually interested in the general case of turning arbitrary verbs into agent nouns just as much.
I have only seen the sub character 々 used before. Now I am encountering the full size character, but cannot figure out how to enter it into a keyboard. Also, I know 々 is a repetition marker. Is there any specific use that the larger version servesExample日本は、世界の国？の中で。。。
I recently watched a Japanese drama titled 「おせん」. The title comes from the first name of the main character - the character's name is 半田{はんだ}仙{せん} who is a young お上{かみ} of a traditional restaurant.My question is: is it common for the honorific お prefix (I guess it is used like that) to be added to names How is it used Other people in the drama often address this character as おせんさん. Is it normal to add both お and さん
I have the following sentence to translate.だれが来てもいいですが少なくても一人は必ず来させて下さいSo far I have the following.Anyone can come buteven if there is few/little1 persondefinitelyplease let me come/please make them come.I just don't get what the translation is suppose to be saying. Can any think of a good translation
I have the following to translate for class.漢字クイズは習った漢字を全部暗記しなくてもいいですが例文を読んだ後で受ければいい点が取れるようです。So far I have the following.As for the kanji quizit is okay if you don't memorize all of the kanji that you have learned butafter reading the sample sentencesif you it seems like you can get a good score.I have only seen 受ける translations as recieve/catch/take/have etc. Nothing seems to really make sense for this sentence. Can anyone think of a good translation
I read this line in a blog today:料理に使えるおススメ品や、ご飯屋さんを紹介しています。   and I have two questions:1) I know that the writer can use katakana for emphasis or for some other reason, but why is it mixed like this Is the お honorific in this case It seems that おすすめ and すすめ have roughly the same meaning, but I really don't know the difference.2) Can you write the honorific prefix in katakana オ in some cases I wonder if you cannot, then that is why it was written this way.
This Asahi Shinbun article has an unmatched right parenthesis in its title:岩手）震災の教訓を考える　「人間復興大学」１０日開学Surely, Japanese syntactic rules disallow unmatched parenthesis, rightAsahi Shinbun just made a mistake (in a title no less), correct
I sometimes find questions that are normally ended with the question particle か to end with かい. For example:いいかい？そうかい？あいつがどうかしたかい？And sometimes with just い without か (if I understand this one right):なんだい？Is かい a softer version of か How is it used
I've always thought that they both mean something like "I see" or "Is that so" and I was told that they have different meaning. Is that so
Witness (to a crime), as a legal/technical term, is 目撃 in Japanese. Now why is this It doesn't seem to relate well with any of the other possible translations for witness, such as　証人、見送る、 or 見届ける. A quick search did not turn up any results.
I have this sentence in a practise JLPT question:サッカー選手{せんしゅ}がずらっと並{なら}んでいる。According to the dictionary I referenced, ずらっと means to "be in a line", and 並{なら}ぶ means "to line up", so wouldn't that make the sentence above redundant Something like, "The soccer players lined up in a line"What does this sentence convey that is different from サッカー選手{せんしゅ}が並{なら}んでいる What is the nuance I'm missingIf ずらっと or 並{なら}ぶ mean something other than the dictionary defition linked above, then what is that meaning
I'm trying to write my grammar explanation notes in Japanese. I'm trying to write an explanation like "Indicates something that is not easy for one to do." I've come up with 自分にされやすくないことを示す。but I'm not sure if 自分に and passive voice is the right way to do this.
A recurring theme on this site is that foreign learners of Japanese use too much kanji. Often the reaction is puzzlement that we can't "just know the right way". Native speakers literally say they don't understand why we use too much kanji:... Why you always write things in kanji, I never understand.Since native speakers can't understand why we do it, there must be some intuitive or logical way to know.Is it as simple as "If the word uses any non-Joyo kanji then hiragana is probably best"Or is it that if we can tell it's ateji then hiragana is to be preferred these daysOr are these just two of several factors involved in decidingFor example, the last word this came up with for me was "まめ" meaning "blister", which has the following kanji spelling which I don't think uses non-Joyo characters but I think probably is ateji: 肉刺
On the surface, many Japanese-English dictionaries define both する and やる as "to do", with little extra context.  Offhand, I know the following:やる and する are not interchangeable when it comes to する verbs (e.g. × 死亡やる)やる also has a number of additional senses along the lines of "to give", especially where the recipient is an inferiorSetting aside the second point for now, what's the 使い分け for the two words in the context of "to do"
Both 僕たち and 僕ら mean we. But is there any difference between them I.e. one of them is more formal than the other, or any grammatical nuances Edit: How is this a duplicate The question linked by Szymon discusses the necessity of using the pluralizing affixes rather than the difference between them. The "Bonus" question asked by Amanda was not answered either.
Whenever I see Japanese school years translated to English, either in vocab lists or in manga/anime translations, it's always with reference to the US school system (i.e. n'th grade). As I'm not American, that makes no more sense to me than the original Japanese. How old are the children in a 小学校, a 中学校, a 高校 (and any other kinds of school I've missed), and how are the years named/numbered in eachIn short, if a schoolchild tells me they're in such-and-such a year of such-and-such school, what does that mean (Or conversely, if I want to describe my school year in Japanese, which type of school do I say)Any other information that would help to describe the differences, such as which years have big exams, would be a useful part of the answer.
I received this message:「行けることになりやした」. Doing a quick Google search for なりやした, I found a few phrases like 「新米母になりやした！」and 「遅くなりやした。」Is it a kind of slang for なりました
What does it mean to put で after a temporal expression I was taught that only に should be used for times but I still see sentences with で sometimes. This is basically my current understanding:Spatial: use に for existential verbs and で otherwiseTemporal: use に alwaysThis is an example sentence that uses a time+で. How would it be different if it used に日本では昼間でも夜でもタクシーを拾うことができる。
For example, I want to say "When I was 8, I wanted to be a go player. When was 10, I dreamed of becoming a novelist. The list goes on."８歳の時、碁打ちになりたいでした。１０歳、小説家になるのが欲しいでした。「？」
I know many words for animals are usually written in katakana in contemporary Japanese, even though kanji exist:イルカクマAnd it seems some very common domestic animals I don't seem to notice written in katakana:猫{ねこ}犬{いぬ}Then there's some others I'm not sure about but have a hunch, including organisms that are not "animals":クモ spiderケヤキ zelkova (a kind of tree)魚 fish鳥 bird馬 horse牛 cowAre there some patterns or rules of thumb I should learn Wiktionary doesn't seem reliable enough to look up which variant to prefer, which other free resource is better, especially when my Japanese isn't good enough to use monolingual sourcesIs it something to do with very common terms being exceptions Or domesticated vs undomesticated Or general terms vs more specific terms closer to individual species Are the rules the same for animals, insects, birds, fish, and plants
While hitchhiking from Tokyo to Sapporo in the past couple of days I devloped a few blisters on the soles of my feet. I like to learn my vocabulary based on my experience so looked up "blister" but found several words and no way to choose between them:すいほう (水疱)みずぶくれ (水脹れ, 水膨れ, 水ぶくれ)ひぶくれ (火脹れ, 火膨れ, 火ぶくれ)まめ (肉刺)I'm assuming the first, 水疱, is a borrowing from Chinese.The next two appear to be native Japanese terms and each have several variant spellings but share one orthogonal difference, one based on water 水 and the other on fire 火.The final one I learned only a day or so after originally asking this question.Could the first term be a general one for all kinds of blisters What of the next two, I can imagine that some kinds of blisters are caused by burns, but what of the 水 wordsAre they for different kinds of blisters Which is correct for the kinds of blisters I haveSince I'm asking, which of the spelling variants should I use when writing these terms
When first learning Japanese grammar, one is usually taught that to express a desire to do something one should use the 〜たい form of the verb:東京へ行きたいOn some occasions, however, I've also seen this sentiment expressed as 〜てほしい, like so:東京へ行ってほしいIs there any particular nuance or usage difference between the two formsBonus question: Are the nuances the same in the case of 〜たがっている and 〜ほしがっている (other than the fact that these forms are used to indicate what it appears other people want to do)
In a TV show I am watching (孤独のグルメ, perhaps many of you have heard of it) the gentleman is about to drink some coffee but pauses to savour the aroma.He saysいい かおり だWhich I translate as "good aroma".Am I right in saying that におい is simply "smell"So perhaps台所から　においに来ています　　a smell is coming from the kitchenand台所から　かおりに来ています　　an aroma is coming from the kitchen(this may not be correct Japanese, please correct me)So in example #2 it is implied there is a nice smell like food is cooking ("aroma") but in example #1 something could be burning or rotting.
I'm trying to say "Taking Japanese class has been [or was] fun" using ものだ.But I don't think this is right:日本語の授業を受けている楽していたものだ。
I need some help with this grammar point ’ことは'.The definition I have is "Indeed one does something alright, but ~"  Verb / い adj ことは V2/ い2 adj　"話すことは”　”高いことは”Examples:高【たか】かったことは高かった笑う【わらう】ことは笑うがおかしくない 便利【べんり】なことは便利だが、高すぎる安い【やすい】ことは安いがたちがわるいWhy is the verb/adjective always written twice It's confusing. I just can't seem to understand these example sentences.
What's a natural way of saying "Is it worth a visit" in Japanese Something like 「訪れ価値がある？」
I was looking up しかも - "furthermore; nevertheless" from this sentence:しかも敵との間合いはキープしたままだ。  Nevertheless keep just within range of the enemybut I am confused by this usage I saw on alc.co.jpしかもなお悪いことに  worse stillRikaichan tells me that なお has a very similar meaning to しか yet here they are used together when I feel that just しかも would suffice.Could somebody explain this please
I came up with a bunch of nouns, so I'm thinking this is a suru verb.Closest thing I came up with is 築庭する。 (chikutei suru), but it translates to landscape gardening.Is there a more common usageThank you! :)I read somewhere in an example sentence that it could be niwashi suru, but when I looked up niwashi (gardener) it didn't have the noun listed as a suru verb so I am unsure :P !
Rather than alternative readings (as seen in manga etc.) I mean deliberate use of a more complex kanji in place of a simpler one, or use of kanji when kanji would not normally be used. A few examples:赤く腫れた目 掠れた聲(Smile by BUMP OF CHICKEN) 聲 used instead of 声; 'hard' kanji used in other words.微睡みの淵で目蓋に揺蕩う(空想メソロギヰ by 妖精帝國) Words that the goo.jp dictionary has an 'x' next to the kanji for... 是程多くの眼がバラバラに  何処に行けば良いのですか  此処に居れば良いのですか  此の先も現在(いま)も無いだけなのに…(アイデンティティ by 椎名林檎) Lots of kanji here, notably for いる、ない、この and それ.日々淡々と腐にふけながら...(Diabolos by DIR EN GREY) This appears to be a bit of kanji wordplay; 腐 is read 'ふ’ here, and appears to have no real meaning unless you look at the lyricsThis (in my experience) appears to be ubiquitous, even for songs targeted at younger audiences (e.g. a 少女時代 song used 侮る, and I know at least one native speaker who can't read that - maybe a rare case). But of course natives are exposed to so much kanji, so can it be assumed that they can handle pretty much any ateji or rare kanji thrown at themAnd what is the effect that the artist is trying to achieve I have been taught so far that using kanji unnecessarily comes across as either pretentious or overly formal (such as 有り難う御座います and the like)...宜しくお願いします！:)
There's a reasonable number of kanji that have on-readings like めい・みょう, へい・ひょう (possibly modulo voicing), etc. For example:平: 平均【へいきん】 vs. 平等【びょうどう】兵: 兵士【へいし】 vs. 兵庫県【ひょうごけん】明: 不明【ふめい】 vs. 明朝【みょうちょう】京: 京阪【けいはん】 vs. 上京【じょうきょう】令: 命令【めいれい】 vs. 律令【りつりょう】Is there some historical reason for this, or is it just a coincidence that all these kanji have -ei and -you readings (My guess is that it has something to do with sound changes in Chinese resulting in borrowings at different times coming with different on-readings; am I right)
What is なり means in the following sentence, as far as I can guess it's close to the second one here.「少なくとも、いきなり挑戦される可能性は低い。その間に、戦う準備なり勝つ方法を考えていかないといけないが…」Some sort of translation:"At the very least, the possibility of us being challenged is low. In  ths time period we have to think about fight preparations and the  way to win."
The literal translation for "資料共" seems to be "total" (Google Translate) or "Documents" (Rikaichan).How would you parse it and interpret it in the context of web conferencing It's supposed to be the equivalent of "web conference".
Recently I've been listening to some Japanese radio stations online. I heard somebody sayお願い出しますa couple of times. I'm now hearing it sometimes in other places.Can somebody tell me what it means I can get search engine results with pages that use it but rikaichan doesn't translate it as a phrase, just the two components.Could somebody explain it to me please
Listening to an ancient rip of Escaflowne soundtrack, I wanted to add artist information to one file. I managed to identify some things from context and matching guesses to dictionary entries, but not all, and the scan is low-quality.　So then I got curious and wanted to find the actual kanji and their meanings.The song in question is nr 17: "If You".* 作詞: ACEILUX is, I guess, lyricist.* 作曲 is composer, but I can't identify the second word: [something]曲.* 菅野よう子 is Yoko Kanno. That was the easy part, with two ひらがな and some anime knowledge.* The last could mean singer, from context, but I didn't find the actual kanji using jisho.org, and the name is just illegible (to me).So basically, I'd love it if someone who actually knows kanji could identify them for me, and maybe give a romanized version of the last name.
So I was watching something last year that involved a visit to 浅草神社.  Along the way there were conversations over what was the preferred way to read the name for the temple—either using the kun readings (あさくさじんじゃ) or on readings (せんそうじ).The next bit struck me as a bit odd, though, when they got on the topic of the temple's 雷門.  I'd always assumed that it was straightforward: らいもん.  As it turns out though, it appears that the proper name for it is a mixed kun-on reading of かみなりもん instead.  Is there any particular reason for thisPicture of the gate in question, for reference:
I am currently studying Japanese, and one of my approaches for studying is by translating applications (since I also make apps for a living).How do I correctly translate "pull down to refresh"Which of the following is the most correct oneリフレッシュするために引き下げてくださいリフレッシュするために下へ引いてくださいリフレッシュするためにプルダウンしてくださいOr do you have a better translation
I would translate it to "Death is dishonest." and Google translate seems to concur.However, Jisho.org where I got this example from, says it means "Death is preferable to dishonor."
Ok, so I've been reading よつばと recently, and I've been seeing a suffix coming up that I cannot seem to find a meaning for. It's not in any dictionary, and I'm not sure if it's a name suffix, or some obscure grammatical marker I've never heard before. Here's an example:おばあちゃんちから帰ってきたら夏休みも後半って感じするなーWhat does the ち after おばあちゃん indicate Is it actually doing something in the sentence, or is it a soft version of ちゃん That's my hypothesis, but I'd like confirmation.
If someone asks, てんぷらをたべたことがありますか？I read that you can answer with なんどもあります. However, I thought it would be たくさんあります. They both mean, "I've done it many times." Right
I think ていた/ている is often used in the following context.A：Bla Bla Bla  A：話、聞いてた？  B：ごめん。聞いてなかった。ちょっと、ボーッとしてたAnother contextA said something to B before he left, but B didn't hear it.  B: Aさん、何か言った？Cは聞いてた。Aさんはなんて言っていたのかな？  C: ええ、今の聞いていなかったの？I think てた/てる might refer to a particular period or time, but I wonder if た is possible in the same context.Will 聞いた and ボーッとした ever be used here
Most of the time when I'm composing e-mail in Japanese it's either:A friendly, informal e-mail to a friendA request for tech support or similar customer serviceWhen composing these e-mails I tend to want to use 拝啓 and 早々, as I was taught for regular letters in class, but they feel far too formal or stilted.  I've occasionally used こんにちは as an opening, but due to the nature of e-mail that feels like it may or may not be appropriate depending on the time it is received.What is the typical practice for phrasing openings and closings in these e-mailsNote: Saw this when prepping, but it doesn't cover what I was looking for.
I'm an amateur runner and I'm struggling a bit with Japanese vocabulary on the topic of running. The phrase that gives me special trouble is "go for a run". I'm not sure how to convey the meaning of running as training in Japanese. Let's say I want to sayI go for a run every morning.So far I tried:毎朝ジョギングしている。  Well, in English jogging is a slow run, not really training. Is it the same in Japanese毎朝走っている。  Is 走る suitable here Isn't it just describing the action of running, not conveying the idea of training毎朝走りこんでいる。  Someone told me 走りこむ is more suitable to describe training. Is that trueWhat would be the best phrase to describe "going for a run"
I'm not sure which way to say something like exit/leave/depart/get off/escape is most appropriate when the thing I want to get off is the system of expressways in Tokyo called the Shuto 首都高.I'm not sure that any of these would be right:出発する 下車する 残す 終了するには
Looking at the answer to this question, it seems that both 行かせられる and 行かされる are valid forms of the causative-passive of 行く. I've only been taught the first usage, so I have a number of related questions regarding the difference between the two.Is the second form a contraction of the first Is there any difference in nuance between the two Is the impression that they give when used any different between the twoCan all 五段 verbs follow this pattern For example, could 読ませられる be replaced with 読まされる If this usage is due to a contraction, is there a similar pattern for 一段 verbs For example, would 出させられる be able to be replaced with an alternate versionWhich usage is used most frequently And is the same usage used in spoken language as in writing (such as in novels)
I have the following sentence to translate for class.岩田先生は、退職なさるまで全世界で貝の化石の御研究をされていて雑誌などに記事をお書きになられたりテレビで放送された教育番組にも出られたSo far I have the following.Professor Iwatauntil he honorably retiresis honorably researching bivalve fossils throughout the whole world andhonorably wrote articles for magazines etc also honorably appeared on the educational program that was broadcasted on TVI am having an issue with the お書きになられたり. First, it seems to be either doubling up the honorifics (normal) or using the passive and I am not sure why. And then there is the り part.  I know the たりたりする structure for "doing things like ... and ...". But the rest of the necessary structure doesn't appear to be there. Can anyone explain what it is saying
I have the following sentence to translate for class.森田さんは、ヴァージニア州立大学を卒業してから日本の映画の会社に就職することになっているSo far I have the following.Morita-sanafter graduating from Virginia State Universitybecame getting a full time job at a Japanese movie company.That することになっている seems strange to me. I would expect するようになっている which is a structure we recently learned. Can anyone explain and maybe give a better English translation
First, I came across this sentence using と in a way I've never encountered before.ピノキオはうそを吐くと、鼻が長くなります。My translation: When/As Pinocchio tells lies his nose becomes longer.After a little research and based on the context of the sentence I figured this use of と must mean 'when' or 'as' as opposed to the 'and' meaning but then I started wondering what the difference is between this 'when' and the 時【とき】 'when' and the たら 'when' in terms of usage.
I am studying an JLPT book on listening, and in two questions very close to each other, the grammatical forms ~たところで and するところだった came up. My book defines ~たところで as giving an impression of giving up because something is perceived to be impossible. An example they give is:走{はし}ったところで...My rough translation is, "(we won't make it) even if we run."My book defines するところだった as meaning something was intended, but it did not happen. An example they provide is:危{あや}うく、だまされるところだった。My approximate translation is, "that was close - we were almost tricked."Both mean something won't happen in spite of intention...This sentence came up in a question:お伝{つた}えするのを忘{わす}れるところでした。And apparently it means that the speaker did not forget to tell someone something.First, I got a little confused about which of the above two variations on ところ was being used, but either way, it seems like it's saying the person did not forget in spite of intending to. Intending to forget something seems a little weird, though, so I think something isn't adding up.Am I right that ~たところで and するところだった are similar in meaning Do they have anything to do with intention And does 忘{わす}れるところでした have anything to do with intending to forget
Here is a small passage from my Japanese Bible, where a king is summoning his servants.さて、彼は...帰って来ると、...[僕]{しもべ}を呼んで来させ、...。 最初の者が...。二番目の者が来て...Why is it referring to the second servant as 二番目の者 instead of the more intuitive (at least to me) 二人目  Is this derogatory somehow, or is it essentially relating [僕]{しもべ} to a 番人, and 番人 are simply counted with ～番Are there other acceptable times to count people this way

I was just wondering if there was a Japanese euphemism analogous to "slurred speech".
When talking to native speakers, I find that I'm often corrected for picking the wrong prefix when using words from the ko-so-a-do series (as in これ、そちら、あそこ、どんな、etc). My confusion mainly involves ko-so-a (the do prefix being simpler since it  indicates a question).What I've been taught is to choose based on a concrete or abstract idea of proximity, which is simple enough for the following particular series:これ: thing close to in-groupそれ: thing close to out-groupあれ: thing distant from both in and out-groupwhich also works nicely for the その、この、あの series. But I find the following difficult: Quotation of oneself or another person:彼女は{そう、こう、ああ}言いました。　Talking about location of oneself or another person:Xは{ここ、そこ、あそこ}で旅行している間に、...Emphasis of some property:{こんな、そんな、あんな}に美味しい魚を食べたことがないって。Those are maybe not the best/most natural example sentence, and the particular choice here is maybe not so relevant. Rather, I am interested in a more general description of how to make these types of choices in an abstract context where proximity is not well-defined.
How to call a picture where due to a camera handling error or inopportune subject move, the subject is not at the intended place (for instance center of the picture), but instead at the edge of the picture, or even out of the picture.For instance, I take a picture of someone but the camera slips in my hand and the resulting picture has the head of the person cut off.In French it is called "erreur de cadrage".If there is no such word, how to call the action of rotating the camera to place the subject at the intended place in the pictureI would say "フレーミング失敗" but I guess it does not sound natural.
I've started to program for android recently and one of my side projects is to make a simple app for learning basic japanese vocabulary and I've been wondering what's the correct way to display furigana between these two.1.2.Is one more standard than the other, or are both just as fine
Ok, I've come across a few expressions involving the word わけ　（訳）such as わけではない, to indicate that something differs from a notion the listener may have; わけがない, to indicate that there is no sense in something, and just ending the sentence with わけだ to indicate a conclusion. I was wondering how many more of these わけ expressions there are, and what they are.
Ok, so I've been having trouble with a passage. It's mostly written in kana, and I can get most of it, but because of the kana, I have no idea what a certain word is. At the beginning of the music video for the Gorillaz music video for Clint Eastwood, it says a line from Dawn of the Dead in Japanese and then in English. Here it is:すべての死体は死にきれているわけではない。人々はそれらを殺し、そしてまた起きあがって殺す。In English, of course, it is:Every dead body that is not exterminated gets up and kills! The people it kills get up and kill!Of course, I understand the general meaning of the Japanese version, because I have a translation. The last part is easy:人々はそれらを殺し、そしてまた起きあがって殺す。When people kill them, they get up again and kill.But the first part I don't understand. I know すべての死体は, and I know 訳ではない, but since it's written in kana, I can't tell at all which きれて is being used. Is it the 〜て form of 切れる Is it the potential form of 切る I don't know why you'd be cutting them, and I don't think it's 着れる (because zombies don't spend much time picking out clothes). Secondarily, I'm unsure of the use of 死に here. Is it being きれて'd towards death, or is it 死に as in the other word for death
Often, I can't hear ん in words. Most recently I've seen this in 攻殻機動隊.Examples:もう少し詳しい検査をしてみないと何とも言えませんが、おそらく外的な要因は見つかりそうもありません...要因 sounds like よういしくじれば、Spring-8の4倍の税金をかけた橋を…Sounds like ぜいき何か途中から犯人のメッセージが一人称から三人称にすり替わってしまったような感じでI hear はんにん just fine, but then I hear いちにいしょう and さんにいしょう総監暗殺予告の件で任意同行してもらうぜ！任意 sounds like にいい to meThe latter example I also heard in the drama お天気お姉さん(in episode 9).①任意です｡②任意というには無理がありすぎる！This is probably the single best example of it. I don't hear anything like someone intentionally trying to produce a sound(edit:That is, a sound between に and い in にんい). So is this a silent letter Is it a quirk that Japanese people are conscious of Is it an accent What allophone is this Anything else I should know about itThanks for the help!
So we all know that most (all) countries' names can be written in kanji as well as kana. And occasionally kanji from these names are used to represent the language of those countries. For example, we can see 「独逸」の「独」 here:「ドイツ統一の中心人物であり、「鉄血宰相（独: Eiserner Kanzler）」の異名を取る。」How is 独 read in this context Is there a consistent rule that applies to all similar instances (米, 伊, 英, etc.)
This question already has answers here:                                            Is the kanji/kokuji “taito” (たいと) with 84 strokes legitimate and ever used                                (2 answers)                            Closed 5 years ago.Back in the day, my friends and I derived much amusement from the kanji that is read 「たいと」, which consists of three 雲 and three 龍:What actual purpose did this kanji serve The Japanese Wikipedia article for it says:日本で苗字として用いられたとされる国字。But the fact that this says 用いられたとされる suggests to me that this is somehow vague, unclear, or disputed. (Personally, it strikes me as an almost comical kanji, and I can't imagine anybody using it seriously.)
In wondering how to expressing the act of picking one's nose in Japanese I came across the following term or terms:穿る / ほじる / ほじくるI got the feeling from WWWJDIC that the two hiragana are synonymous but differently sounding readings of the one kanji term. And further that the kanji spelling itself is not used currently.Is this correct Or are ほじる and ほじくる different in some way Should 穿る be used or avoided

Improve this question                    I am unhappy with the translation of grammatical 専門用語{せんもんようご}. The technical terms used to describe English and Japanese grammar should never overlap. I see words such as 名詞{めいし}=noun、動詞{どうし}=verb、形容詞{けいようし}=adjective、 carelessly interchanged.English grammar that does not exist in the Japanese language:関係代名詞{かんけいだいめいし}、過去分詞{かこぶんし}、接続法{せつぞくほう}、etc.Those grammar structures (relative pronouns / past participles / subjunctive mood) don't exist in Japanese. Therefore, those words can be strictly translated.  Japanese grammar not in English:使役形{しえきけい}、形容動詞{けいようどうし}、助詞{じょし}So, those words can be strictly translated to English: "causitive form", "na-nominal", "particle".Now, both languages have parts of speech that are similar in idea such as 動詞{どうし}/verb、形容詞{けいようし}/adjective、and 受身形{うけみけい}/passive voice. But, they are not the same!動詞 = "verb"yeah. Well sort of. But "verbs" have participles and "動詞" do not。Based on that alone, 動詞 should not translate to "verb".  形容詞 = "adjective"Sure. That is the idea, but 形容詞 are inflectible. Adding "-ly" to many adjectives is sort of like an inflection that creates adverbs, but not always. 形容詞 is the general idea of an adjective, but it is not an "adjective".So, aren't these better translations:"動詞" translates to, based on surrounding context, "Japanese verb" or "English verb"."verb" translates to, based on surrounding context "日本動詞{にほんどうし} or "英動詞{えいどうし}"Basically, "動詞" is translated as "verb", but it is not a "verb". They are very, very, similar. However, I can put a "verb" into 12 (or so) tenses. A "動詞", only into 4 tenses. So, they are not the same. Linguistics is a science, and all science needs strict protocols to follow. Does anyone understand what I am rambling about
This question already has an answer here:                                            Where does the verbal form しとく come from                                (1 answer)                            Closed 6 years ago.I came across the phrase やめときます in alc.co.jp, which is apparently translated to things like "I'll pass" or "I'd better not."It didn't appear as a stand-alone word in the dictionaries I checked, so I'm wondering if it's a contracted form of two other words.Just for the sake of making a guess...I'll guess that it's 止め (imperative form of 止む) and 説く.
I'm reading a children's book and this silly shrimp says ここで寝ましょう... but there's no one else around... If ましょう is a way to state that what you are saying is subjective not objective, and depends on your volition/understanding... then why would you say it to yourself.Is it like when someone says "Well I guess I shall go to bed then" out loud to no one in particularBONUS:Are there any other contexts where you are only referring to yourself when you say ましょう　しよう etc.   I think I saw someone say  "これを買いましょう" to affirm their decision, as in "I shall buy this one".
OK , so I am a huge fan of Kill la Kill, and I looked up how to say "Fear is Freedom, Control is Release, Contradiction is Truth". The whole line in Japanese is:「恐怖こそ自由！君臨こそ解放！矛盾こそ真理！それがこの世界の真実だ！服を着た豚ども！その真実に屈服せよ！」Now, this Japanese is pretty simple, and I totally get the meaning (obviously, since there's a translation, but I mean that I understand how the language here works). However, I'm not sure what こそ is doing here. I know that it emphasizes the previous word, but is that enough to form a statement Can someone explain what it's doing here, and the proper use of itAlso, secondarily, I'm wondering why ども is required here. I was pretty sure that it was used to mean "both", so why is it needed here, where she is not addressing both pigs in human clothing, so much as a whole crowd of them
I always wondered about the meaning of this name in Japanese, but couldn't find much on Google. Can someone tell me what it meansUPDATE: 茶々{ちゃちゃ} was a concubine to Toyotomi Hideyoshi in the Sengoku Period.

I've been living in Hokkaido for a while now, and there are plenty of dinky buildings on flat surfaces that have ハイツ stuck on the end of their names.

I'm reading a short story 「かえるくん、東京を救う」 by Haruki Murakami. I found a passage where 非 is attached to two nouns, I guess to give them the meaning of opposition.ぼくは純粋なかえるくんですが、それと同時にぼくは非かえるくんの世界を表象するものでもあるんです。ぼく自身の中には非ぼくがいます。I know I'm reading a literary work so words can be made up but is it a normal practice to attach 非 to words this way How to translate that best into English Is "anti-" appropriateI am a genuine Frog but at the same time I'm the symbol of the anti-Frog world.There's anti-me inside of me.
What is それ in 「俺もそれを強制しないようにしている。」 I think that the author says something like this - "...and I'm trying to not force her to do it(しっかりとした料理) too." Also is it correct to think that 「めんどくさい」 is saying the sister of author, who doesn't want to cook普段は８割くらいジャンクフードやカップラーメンのみで構成されているウチの食卓なのに、今日は珍しくしっかりとした料理を作ってるみたいだ。いつもは仕事で疲れてるから、そういった食事でも特に文句は言わない。ズボラってのもあると思うが、この家の維持費は、みんなねぇさんが働いたお金でやりくりされてるし、勿論俺の学費、食費、小遣いもそうだ。多少「めんどくさい」っていって食事が簡略されるのは仕方が無いことだし、俺もそれを強制しないようにしている。Some sort of translation of the whole sentence:"It couldn't be helped that she's saying "it's a bother" and as a result  our meal is simplified, and I'm trying to not force her to do  it(しっかりとした料理) too."
I just heard a sentence this morning - "how much money do you have"お金、どれぐらい　ある？I have always been taught "how much" is どのぐらい so hearing どれぐらい has caught me off-guard.As I recall we use この with an object, and これ when there is not one.So...お金、どれぐらい　ある？どのぐらい　お金が　ある？Is my understanding correct
I understand that 教わる【おそわる】 is the intransitive of 教える【おしえる】 (to teach), however I'm not sure how to use it properly outside of possibly in an adjectival context (e.g. 授業で教わったこと).  In practice, what is the difference between 教わる and any of the myriad verbs for "to learn" (習う【ならう】, 学ぶ【まなぶ】, etc.)

"いくらですか？” seems like a common phrase taught to all students of Japanese But, instead of saying "いくらですか？", I always used to go honorific and say "おいくらですか？".Is adding 美化語{びかご} to "いくら" wrong Could it ever be wrong After all, you cannot ask yourself questions. Why is the honorific "おいくら" not really taught "それはいくらですか？" sounds aggressive and "in your face"
When I was still in Okinawa I learned how to say "cheers" / "乾杯{かんぱい}".You can either say just karii or you can use the extended version I pefer karii sabira.My question is how to write it I have found things saying katakana is best and others saying hiragana is best, but I'm also not sure the best way to write the long "i".かりいさびらかりーさびらカリイサビラカリーサビラThen while I was looking up just a bit earlier I was surprised to find at least one way to write it in Kanji!嘉例佳例This is just the karii part, so the other options would be the same for the sabira part.
This is a question how to read long complicated sentences, and by default how we should translate them because you can't really be sure you have understood something if you can't say it in your mother tongue.It took me a while to work out what the writer was saying in the sentence below. I may still be wrong but it consists of a very long sentence ending in a question (in bold). I turned this in to one short question followed by an explanation of that short question.Is this the right way to do itBackground: This is an essay on Ralph Emerson, an American philosopher who said that people spend too much focussing on the future. They should live for moment. He drew a comparison to   a rose which is no less for not being in full bloom all its life.一本のバラがそうであるように、自分が今ここに生きていることが、自分や神と言った人間を越えた大きな存在に、無条件で喜ばれていると気づく時、歯を食いしばっても力みが抜けて、前を向く勇気と力が、穏やかな喜びとともに、心の内側から沸いてくるのではないでしょうか。そのように気づくことが、エマソンの言う「今を生きる」ことのように思えます。Just like the rose, is not living for the moment the time you become aware of the pleasure of an existence which transcends yourself or a person such as a god When you are gritting your teeth and losing your strength, the power and courage to go on comes with that serene pleasure aroused in your heart.  It seems that  this awareness is what Emerson meant when he talked of "living for the moment".(And please feel free to improve on my "flowery" translation. I am still not sure why 喜ばれている is passive.)Source: 中上級日本語、April 2014
According to WWWJDIC, 歯止め is used as follows:歯止めをかける; 歯止めを掛ける (exp,v1) to curb; to halt; to apply brakes; to put an end toThe English translations have a pretty good correspondence with the imagery, especially if you consider 歯車.Consider the opposite action:To get things moving; to get it in drive; to weigh anchor; to find purchase; to stop spinning wheels; to find traction; to [actually] get started; to get underwayWhat would be a Japanese expression that corresponds 取りかかる, 緒に就く, 切り口, and 糸口 all come to mind, but they're still not quite right. The physical lurch when a vehicle or mechanism starts delivering power is the key to all of these English expressions; I would like to get as close as possible while staying within natural expressions.
When I was in Okinawa drinking sake I asked my host what the Japanese word for the sake cup was and was told:お猪口{ちょこ}Then today I went to the Nezu Museum in Tokyo which currently has a collection of sake utensils on display. Every single cup there bore the label:さかづき in the rubi and either 盃 or 酒盃 for the kanji.So I was originally going to ask what the difference is between おちょこ and さかづき but on looking up the latter for the right kanji to use in this question I was bombarded with these variants:杯(P); 盃; 坏; 巵; 卮; 盞; 觚; 觴; 酒盃(iK) 【さかずき(P); さかづき; うき(盞)】So it seems that the exhibit was using neither the preferred/popular kanji nor the preferred/popular pronunciation!What am I to make of all this Which word should I use for sake cup Why would the museum go with an uncommon variant Are there nuances
I was translating some lines earlier and I ran into a snag after the speaker said this:その言葉は重くて、遊びで戦っているのではない事だけは俺にも伝わりました。My main problem comes from the 遊びで戦っている part and I'd like to confirm that I'm reading this right.What I'm seeing is that the speaker's saying that that he understood, from a mentor's words (that he overheard a few seconds ago), that they are fighting despite not liking itAddendum: Or it also mean that they're not fighting as a game/for the hell of it Because the whole point of this scene is that the speaker has realized that everyone around him has a reason to why they're fighting in the first place.Is this interpretation correctThanks for the help.
According to this answer, "This made me laugh" would translate literally into Japanese as:これが僕{ぼく}を笑{わら}わせた。However, the same answer explains that this would be an odd thing to say in Japanese, because the Japanese language tends to avoid using an "inanimate subject".As far as I know, in English we don't have any preference for whether or not a subject is animate or inanimate, though I could be wrong about that. I don't know how English works, I just think with it, and maybe I make unconscious habitual choices.In any case, I have no conceptual model for this inanimate/animate subject distinction, and, as far as I can remember in all my years of studying Japanese, this is the first time it's ever come up for me.How strange is a statement like これが僕{ぼく}を笑{わら}わせた Are there examples where the animate/inanimate distinction would lead to unparsable statements, or is it just mildly awkward sounding"This made me laugh" in English is a perfectly acceptable statement, but are there parallels in English to the Japanese distinction between animate and inanimate subjects that would help me conceptualize what is happening in Japanese
I'm reading through Tae Kims grammar guide and have just got into the last section. It says that である is the formal state of being.Can anyone tell me...why is this It would seem logical to me based on what I've learned that であります shouldbe the formal state of being. Does this mean something differentWhy is である all you need for this formal state of being
This is my understanding:  "どうしようもない" is a complete sentence. (There is nothing that can be done.)"noun + もない" is the sentence structure.  therefore: "どうしよう" = "noun""どうする" is a sentence ending with a verb (ie. not a noun).Is "どうしよう" a noun Is it the same part of speech as "どうする" &lt;--- question #1 If "どうする" = [part of speech] = "どうしょう", then "どうしようもない" is not grammatically correct. A verb cannot be the subject. So, there are 3 ways to change a verb to noun:(#1) "する事"(#2) "する物"(#3) "するのparticle"  "noun+もない" needs a noun as the subject."どうする" surely is the subject in "どうしようもない", but "どうする" is a verb.so, using method #3, we use a particle to change "どうする" into a noun. The particle is "も".  Therefore, is the phrase "どうしようのもない。" grammatically correct
In this question, we are presently trying to better understand the function of the は that happens here:当時{とうじ}母{はは}がどんな気持{きも}ちだったのか、子{こ}どもの私{わたし}には知{し}るべくもないことだった。meaningwhise, we are all agreed that the sentence means:As a child I had no way of knowing how my mother felt at that time.(I'm just going with ssb's translation).My question here is: can the は after 子供の私に be removed or does that make the sentence ungrammatical / Is this は just a topic marker a topic marker and a contrastive marker or something further
I have the following sentence to translate.行ってほしくないと言われたが新聞記者になりたいので国際交換瑠学生の試験に受からなくても行くことにしたSo far I have the following.It was said ... doesn't want ... to go buthe wants to become a newspaper reporter sohe decided to go even if he doesn't pass the international exchange student examI am having trouble with that first segment. I think the てほしい structure is used to say you want someone to do something for you. So I don't get who is not wanting who to go. If the subject just didn't want to go, I would expect 行きたくない.
硬{かた}い, 堅{かた}い, and 固{かた}い all have very similar meaning and can be generally translated to English as "hard, tough, solid, stiff". Yet it seems that different kanji are used in different situations. From what I could gather, the differences might be:硬い is used especially for stone or metal (e.g. 硬い石),堅い is used for wood (e.g. 堅い材木); it also means stiff, formal (e.g. 堅い言葉),固い means stiff, not flexible (e.g. 固いカラー); also means stubborn, unyielding (e.g. 固い約束).Am I right There seem to be spellings used for wood, stone or metal, what about other substances Are there situations where those kanji are interchangable or maybe the word is written using hiragana as かたい
Over on this awesome answer about old and unused katakana forms, I notice that among the examples is the word "valve", written as ヷァルブ. It has a small ァ character in addition to the ヷ that precedes it. What puzzles me is that I can't imagine how ヷァルブ would be pronounced any differently than ヷルブ. Maybe the small ァ does the same thing as ー, but then why not write it as ヷールブ Also, I'm no expert on katakanization of English, but I wouldn't think extending the vowel sound in "valve" would be the right way to convert it.ヷァルブ might be an archaic way of writing "valve" that is no longer in use, but it reminded me of a store I pass by on my bike now and again, called サァラ麻布{あざぶ}. I've never been interested in the furniture they sell, but the name has always caught my attention. They write the English version of their name as "Sala Azabu". If I had seen the English first and someone asked me to write it in katakana, I'd have simply gone with サラ.What is the small ァ character doing in these instances How is サァ pronounced differently from サー or サ
I have this sentence in my JLPT practise book:テレビでもパソコンでも、なかったらなかったでなんとかなるものだよ。It's part of a review question about the grammatical form ～たら～たで, which I understand to mean something close to "whether or not". One example they give is 電話{でんわ}に出{で}たら出{で}たで, which I think means "whether or not the phone is answered". Perhaps I am wrong about this grammatical form.With the sentence above, I have a vague semblance of parts, but they are not coming together. It's something like, "Television or personal computers, whether you have them or not, you'll manage somehow"... I know that なんとかなる is "manage somehow", and もの in this case is probably referring to some reason or matter.My current, unsatisfactory, translation seems way too vague to be right. What exactly does this sentence mean
In a recent question, we talked about using sentence-ending 〜だと after a verb, quoting something you found surprising.  The example given in the linked question is as follows:Ａ「なんでもします！」  Ｂ「なんでもするだと!」I'm curious what variations だと can take with this usage.  I can think of four, substituting です for だ and substituting って for と:だとだってですとですってWhich of these variations are possible with this usage  Did I leave any variations out(Unfortunately, I'm not sure where to look this up.  For some reason, dictionaries don't seem to list だと, even though its usage seems to be different from a simple combination of だ and と.)
One aspect that contributes to the very high legibility of the Latin alphabet is that the letters have ascenders and descenders which creates a characteristic silhouette for different words. This way, a word can even be read when the top or bottom 50% is cut away. Additionally, it speeds up the reading.In Japanese, all characters have the same height and no ascenders or descenders. Sometimes, Kanji are set bigger than Kana which improves legibility. But writing kana with ascenders and descenders is uncommon.I saw it written that way on a beer ad in the Tokio metro, ハ was as big as x, some characters were descending like p and some ascending like h. I unfortunately do not have a photo of it and forgot which characters were higher and which ones lower.Is there a preferred way of setting the kana like this Which kana should be x high, which ones cap high and which ones descending and which ones ascending"That concept doesn't exist in Japanese". But it is being used and does improve legibility. We don't have to do something the way we always did.
I don't get what するとみた and よくばって　means in this sentence : よくばってかなり時間オーバーをするとみた。As for the context : the speaker is waiting for someone to get out of a room. He just said : まる1日ちょうどで出て来るとは限らんぞ。Rikaichan tells me that 欲張る means "to covet, to lust for" but that doesn't help much...And I wasn't able to find any information on するとみる.Thanks for your time.
Can somebody help me with the translation for実際にうつ病やアルツハイマーの治療として、女性患者に化粧やヘアチェンジを実践することもあるくらいです。お化粧はテンションをあげてくれるお薬でもあるんですね。I came up with thisDid you know (or truthfully), as a treatment for depression or Alzheimer's, female patients will practice using make-up or change their hair colour Cosmetics are a medicine that can heighten your tensionI'm really not sure about the second sentence.
I've come across two different words for "to dry" in my readings: 干す【ほす】 and 乾く【かわく】.  I've seen both used to refer to things drying out (e.g. 「白妙の衣干すちょう」 from the 2nd poem in the 百人一首  or 「涙は乾いた」 in the case of the latter).  I've also seen the related 渇く【かわく】, but that seems to be limited to topics related to thirst (e.g. 渇いた喉).Can anyone provide some insight into when each is appropriate
This is the kind of simple question I'm often too embarrassed to ask, because I should probably know this by now. But here goes...I was ordering something at a cafe, and I noticed some slightly awkward English on the menu something that made me laugh. It wasn't super funny or anything, it just caught me a little off guard. The cashier noticed me laugh and looked puzzled. So I pointed at the text and said:これを笑{わら}わせた。This happens all the time where I speak off the cuff, and then after the moment has passed, I realize I almost certainly said it wrong. Unfortunately, unlike other cultures, in Japan people rarely call you out. The cashier didn't look at me like "what the hell did you just say", she just smiled. Leaving me unsure if I basically spoke complete nonsense and she was being nice, or that maybe I was close enough and she couldn't be bothered to offer any adjustments.Passive and causative verb forms and the right particles to go with them have always been a source of trouble for me.I think I should have said:僕{ぼく}を笑{わら}わせたI am the thing being made to laugh, so it's acting on me, so I take the particle を. However, I want to make  the thing I'm pointing at the focus of my sentence, not me. So, maybe I should have said:これで笑{わら}わせたIn a sense, I was made to laugh by this thing I'm pointing at. It's a shortened form of:(僕{ぼく}に)これで笑{わら}わせた。I often turn out to be totally wrong, so, am I wrong again What would be the best way for me to express, while pointing at the text on the menu, "this made me laugh"Also see this question and answer about the causative and passive forms of 笑 for related information. A joke is an interesting edge case, because, as explained in answers below, a thing has no animacy, so it doesn't "make" people laugh, but a joke is the result of actions between people, so in a sense, the joke us a proxy that can be said to "make" people laugh.
My former teacher made us really pay attention to kana stroke order and stroke types (とめる、はねる、and はらう). Yet when it came to kanji she only made us study the stroke order. I've noticed that other people also disregard kanji stroke type. Why is that Is it because of the sheer amount of information (It's easy to remember a few kana stroke types while the same does not hold true to kanji.) What do natives have to say about this
I'm currently working on a translation of a song ("故" by Gremlins) and I have run into something quite strange... While it is not unusual for Japanese lyricists to use kanji with a different meaning than what their singing suggests, or otherwise be creative with their lyrics, I cannot find a connection here, or even understand why he would use these kanji together.The lyrics goes like this:愛が故、枯れる花弁。哀しき月明かり。息を沈め、空溶かし、今艶を求む。降り注ぐ優しき愛で、あなたを愛憎しむ。亡きを見つめ、飛び続け、尚、供膳を望む羽ばたいて。I am almost a hundred percent certain what he says is 'kuzen wo nozomu' but while the reading makes sense, I don't actually know what it would mean Nozomu looks sligtly different to me too, but that could be the small font in the pamphlet, I am not sure. I haven't been able to find the kanji I see it as anywhere...Does anyone have any suggestions The theme is very traditional, so there could be some classical or outdated kanji use involved, but I have no clue.
I was browsing through the webpage of Japanese radicals on wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_Japanese_kanji_radicals)I noticed74 - 月and130 - 肉bot entries are referencing in the most right column to the respective other radicalI looked furthermore into the KANJIDIC2 kanji-lexicon file and it seems like these two kanjis-radicals are seemingly randomly assigned to kanjis.According to this dictionary, the Kanji 育 has 肉 as radical (which it obviously has not, its 月). I made this observation in many places (I assumed all open dictionaries rely on the same public Kanji dictionary)&lt;literal&gt;育&lt;/literal&gt;&lt;codepoint&gt;&lt;cp_value cp_type="ucs"&gt;80b2&lt;/cp_value&gt;&lt;cp_value cp_type="jis208"&gt;16-73&lt;/cp_value&gt;&lt;/codepoint&gt;&lt;radical&gt;&lt;rad_value rad_type="classical"&gt;130&lt;/rad_value&gt;&lt;rad_value rad_type="nelson_c"&gt;8&lt;/rad_value&gt;&lt;/radical&gt;Does anyone know the (historical) background of this 肉／月 radical interchangeability
Can Xの担当 have both of these meanings If so, then without context to disambiguate the two meanings, is one of the two more commonly used For example, how would you translate the sentence Xの担当を決めたら？To me, it could be either "How about you decide who is in charge of X" or "How about you decide what X is in charge of" If both are grammatically valid translations, then is one of these more commonly used than the other, or do you have to completely rely on context to decide which one Also, this is a vague followup, but does the answer to this question also generally apply to the construction (noun)の(verb) Does NのV mean "something that N does V to" (N is subject) and "something that does V to N" (N is object)
I don't get what 少しでも and と mean in this sentence (from a manga) : 人々の多くは少しでもターゲットになりにくそうな僻地に身を隠そうとムダな努力を始めていた。I remember reading that the conditional と couldn't be use with the volitional form so I guess it relates to 始める, but I have no idea what AとBを始める would mean...My guess as to a translation (eluding 少しでも):Many people started to make useless efforts to hide in remote places that looked like they couldn't easily become targets.Thanks for your time.
I've seen multiple language books, videos, etc. refer to this great, wonderful, magnificent general-purpose counter known as つ.  The problem  I've also seen multiple source say that つ doesn't work with numbers greater than 10.  Which means I can't personally take this very seriously, and unfortunately, language manuals tend to just skip over any explanation of what you're supposed to do with numbers greater than 10.Maybe they just mean that you have to change over from the ひとつ、ふたつ、みっつ counting system to the いち、に、さん counting system, but if that's so, there's no way to tell from the way that language manuals tend to word this.  So what do you do for general-purpose counting after 10 (or before 1)
I'd like to apologize for not being able to do xyz.Rather than just saying 「すみません、何々ができません。」, could I say something like:何々ができなくてしまいます。Or is しまう always used with a positive te-form verb
I have seen and been taught many words meaning "feeling", but what is the difference between the words, and where are they usedI have done a bit of research myself and have come up with these meanings. Are they correct Could someone please give a more detailed explanation具合 - health related気分 - mood気持ち - inner/emotional feeling感じ - outside/perceived feeling感覚 - 感情 - 意識 - 情 - 情意 - 心持ち - Are there any others I should know about
I have the following sentence in my JLPT practise book:当時{とうじ}母{はは}がどんな気持{きも}ちだったのか、子{こ}どもの私{わたし}には知{し}るべくもないことだった。My faltering translation is something like, "How did my mother feel at the time, she couldn't have known it was me."I'm unclear on the implications. It seems to be that the mother's feelings are unclear because of not knowing who the speaker is, but who the speaker is and how the mother would express it don't seem logically related to me. For example, if she shouted because she was angry, it wouldn't matter who she thought she was shouting at for an outside observer to determine she was angry.How does knowing who the speaker is and her feelings at the time connect I feel because I don't have a logical interpretation of the implications, my translations doesn't feel correct.What would be a more accurate translation than mine
Background: if you have a noun, the easiest way to convert it into a verb is by gluing a する onto the end of it. Examples of this abound, ranging from old Sino compounds to recent English borrowings. Sometimes, a novel 五段 verb can also be constructed from a non-verb. Examples of this include:グーグル　→　ググる ("to Google; to search")メモ　→　メモる ("to make a note of")びっくり　→　びくる ("to be surprised / startled", I think)サボタージュ　→　サボる ("to slack off; to skip")写メ【しゃメ】　→　写メる【しゃメる】 ("to take a picture with a mobile device")Observe that all of the verbs thus formed are ラ行 verbs. Can this process only give rise to ラ行 verbs, or can it also produce other types of 五段 verbs, e.g. カ行 or サ行
Does it make sense to talk about サ変名詞 as being 自動詞 or 他動詞 If so, surely some are 他動詞：車{くるま}を運転{うんてん}する。日本語{にほんご}を勉強{べんきょう}する。庭{にわ}を散歩{さんぽ}する。  But, what about 自動詞 Perhaps this posting of mine from awhile ago describes 自動詞としてのサ変名詞 (but maybe not)？ More likely, I have insufficient vocab knowledge to think of even one.  And, in a broader context, I am interested in if, in a transitive sentence (regardless of if it is サ変名詞 or not), with a specified direct object, must "を" always be the final 助詞{じょし}  thank you.
My company is developing an iPhone game that will be for sale in the US and Japan.  There is a share button that allows people to text message, email, Facebook, and twitter their friends about the game.  In english, the button just says "share".  What would be the appropriate replacement for this in Japanese that makes sense culturallyI am trying to use the culturally correct word.  I have found 分かち合う.  But I believe this word more accurately means "dispense."分け合う is what I believe I should use.  I just want to make sure it is correct and makes sense so no one is offended.
I don't understand  the meaning of ~つもりではいる in this sentence :そしていちおう手加減してやるつもりではいるが殺されてしまっても負けとなる。And, although I'm planning on going easy on you, you will also lose if you happen to get killed.I'm familiar with the ~つもり+である construction and I remember reading somewhere that でいる could sometimes replace である (not sure about that).So is it でいる + は (and what difference is there between である、でいる and ではいる)Or is it で (て forme of だ) + 入る and in that case, what does はいる mean in that contextOr something else entirely
The subtitles don't explain this pun/joke at all in the episode 87 of Space Brothers anime, but I'd like to figure out how it works.There's a lot of repeating "arumi can" and "aru mikan" in the pun. The pun is obviously about an aluminum can, and if the orange can stay on top of it, but I'd like to know exactly what's going on with the sounds.Here's the youtube video I just made with all the puns: http://youtu.be/vVsskPeb_VAPlease, help me identify the words that make these puns.
In my JLPT textbook, I have this sentence:彼{かれ}は国民{こくみん}の信頼{しんらい}を裏切{うらぎ}った。それゆえに、権力{けんりょく}の座{ざ}を追{お}われることとなったのである。I think this sentence means, "He betrayed the trust of the people. As a result, it was the case that he was chased out of his seat of power." "Seat of power" may be overly literal, it's probably more like his seat in the Diet or something, but that's not the part I'm concerned with.It's the 権力{けんりょく}の座{ざ}を追{お}われること part. From the overall context of the sentence, I'm guessing the guy was chased from the seat. But, from the grammar, because of the を particle that points directly to the chair, it feels like it should mean the seat itself had been chased.Am I right that it means the guy was chased from the chair If so, why does 座{ざ}を追{お}われる not mean the chair got chased If I'm wrong about the meaning, then what does it mean
Consider the verb pairs 表【ひょう】する and 表【ひょう】す、or 訳【やく】する and 訳【やく】す。I realize the distinction may be academic(for example, either way the ます form is always spelled 訳します), but what is the functional difference between these pairs, and when is one used over the other
This is a loose follow-up of my first question here on JLSE. I tried to check gogen-allguide.com and 大辞林, but couldn't find anything definitive. Unfortunately I don't know any other resources for checking etymologies for (native) Japanese words.So, my question is: What is the etymology of 宵【よい】 My guess would be 夜(よ)日(ひ).
Here is a sentence taken from a manga:その節は私にたくさんのエネルギーを提供して頂いてありがとう。Thank you for having provided me with all that energy at that time.I don't get why 私 is used with the particle に instead of が (or not being used at all). The way I see it :AがBにCを提供する。A provides B with C.BがAにCを提供して頂く。B is (receiving the favor of being) provided with C by A.Is it the use of ～てありがとう that swaps the particles Literally, something like:AがBにCを提供して頂いてありがとう。A is thanked by B (who is glad) for being provided with C.
Please go easy on me if this seems too basic and obvious, I'm a beginner.I always had the impression that there were counters that went with the native Japanese numbers and counters that went with the Sino Japanese numbers.But now I'm wondering if I'm wrong and that only the Sino Japanese numbers are used with all counters except for some exceptions:～つ always uses native Japanese numbers:ひとつ、ふたつ、みっつFor counting people, only "one" and "two" use native Japanese with ～り and all other numbers use Sino Japanese with ～にん:ひとり、ふたり、さんにんFor some reason I find it hard to search for this and what I do find seems to be poorly worded and convoluted such that I can't extract this little fact from the discussions easily at all.
Yesterday my (also non Japanese) friend had a headache and we had to buy medicine in Japanese.So I looked up how to say "headache" and add it to my vocabulary.I found the word 頭痛{ずつう} and I suppose it could be used in sentences like 頭痛があるBut when I told my friend about 頭痛 he said "no that's not right." He said it's 頭{あたま}が痛{いた}い so you would make a sentence like 頭が痛いだ.Obviously they both use the same characters but in different ways. Is the second sentence more colloquial Is 頭痛 more technical Are they both just as common
I am looking at a Japanese map of the early 19th century. It contains a printed comment that I am trying to find translation for. It does not seem to be modern Japanese so I am wondering what kind of (outdated) Japanese this is. (See Image)
Could someone explain what this word means It seems to describe a man who will do anything a woman he likes wants him to do but it is not that obvious from the E&amp;J defintions and picture below, which I have borrowed from the book "Onomatopoeia."The best clue from the definition is the word だらしない but the meanings of that do not seem to fit (slovenly, womanizing, weak). The key English word, "spoony" seems to exist only in  Japanese dictionaries.態度、身なりなどにしまりがない様子。とくに、男性が女性に対してだらしない態度をとる形容に多く用いる。  Describes a loose attitude or appearance. Often used to describe a man's spoony attitude toward a woman.
In Japan I often felt いいえ or 違う is not the best choice, when asked, if I don't carry something with me. Like at the airport security lady asked me, if I there were any forbidden objects in my luggage. I can't recall the question, but it ended in ない？ I felt lost for a second and she tried to help me out with a correct answer and said in a confirming tone ない, and I used her tip and said ない！I used that couple of times in other situations. Is this okay to say it like that or should I produce a better lengthier sentence, like 何も持っていない
I just came back from Japan, it is my first time, so I found myself in the situations, that I wasn't prepared for.At the convenience store I noticed natives tend not to say much to the staff at all, but I just want to confirm that I understand it right.First when I come in everyone shouts いらっしゃいませ - I know I'm not supposed to answer, but I still throw some こんにちは, since I just feel strange not to answer.I walk around and workers occasionally say いらっしゃいませ again and bow, so I say こんにちは and bow too, but native buyers seem to ignore いらっしゃいませ + bow combo. Is this fine and politeThen I bring products to the cash register and say こんにちは again and I really want to say something more, but can't find words and keep silent. I get some polite phrases thrown at me and presented with a number to pay. I say ちょっと待っててね and look for coins. So my coins are lying on the plate and I want to say "that's it", "I'm done", "please take my money" or something, but I really can't find the words and I just make some gestures waving the wallet and hands...I can go on, but in short I really felt I'm not following some predefined step-by-step actions and not using common phrases, I say too much hellos and bow all the time.When I leave any form of "Goodbye" seem not appropriate, looks like past-tense "Thank you" is what natives say or not saying anything and just silently walking out is good.In your answer I would like to see an example of a common dialog, tips when to bow and when to say nothing.よろしくお願いします。
Having been on the receiving end of Japanese hospitality quite a bit in the past week, I'd like to know the best way to thank people for it in Japanese.I've found several words for "hospitality" but don't know which is closest to English:款待{かんたい}持{も}て成{な}し厚情{こうじょう}I also wouldn't be surprised if the best way to thank somebody in this way in Japanese might not even involve one of these words but rather be phrased very differently to the English expression for language or cultural reasons.
I was reading a guide to 刑事ドラマ and 時代劇場. Most of the definitions follow the format:真犯人：本当の犯人。  盗人・盗賊：他人の物を盗む人。However for one or two words such as 「罪人」 it says:罪人：犯罪者**のこと**。例：友人のことを罪人扱いするなんてひどい！My 大辞泉 dictionary tells me 罪人＝罪を犯した人。つみびと。- ie a person not a "こと”What is the nuance of こと here　Why does it not just say:罪人：犯罪者 [例：友人のことを罪人扱いするなんてひどい！]
I'm working with a translation program, trying to translate the following sentence correctly:The attacker may use a cross-site scripting attack to do this.The program gives me:攻撃 者 は 、 クロス サイト スクリプティング 攻撃 を 使用 し て 行 う こと が でき る 。I don't see the direct object 'this' from the source sentence translated. If this translated sentence followed a sentence mentioning the nature of 'this' (as would normally be the case), would the sentence seem natural (i.e. implied direct object referring to previous sentence) Or does it seem like something is missingI hope I made myself clear, it's kind of hard to explain what I mean...
I thought I might add a word to my Japanese vocabulary that means as close to "to wander" as possible in English.In the English Wiktionary three Japanese words are mentioned but only one has an entry:彷徨う / さ迷う - both read as さまようぶらつくうろつくAre there some subtle differences between these words Is one better as a general translation of the English word If there are multiple senses or connotations I'm most interested in one with positive associations of exploring aimlessly without a plan, mostly on foot.

Improve this question                    上代特殊仮名遣い【じょうだいとくしゅかなづかい】 is a Nara-period practice in which two distinct versions of certain syllables (called 甲類【こうるい】 and 乙類【おつるい】, and denoted by subscript 1 and 2 in Latin script) were consistently denoted using different manyogana. For example, the word we now write as 上【かみ】 is /kami1/, which could be rendered with the second syllable as 美, while 神【かみ】 is /kami2/, which could be rendered with the second syllable as 尾. The Wikipedia article states that "the phonetic difference [between the two types] is unclear", so it looks like this isn't a solved problem. Even so, I would like to know what we do know about the phonetic differences between the 甲類 and 乙類 syllables (if we know anything at all).
Wasei-eigo and most Gairaigo (especially in a text or sentence as opposed to being by itself) is usually written in Katakana (イメージ, ジュース, スマート,パンツ,アベック). However, there are times that have seen some in their original Romaji form (image, juice, smart, pants, avec) even in a Japanese sentence, ex. 彼女のpantsです; juiceが好き; ジョーンはsmartですよ; 数々のavecを見た; etc. Is this common or incorrect What does it mean if you do this as opposed to using Katakana
There's already a question that discusses にかんして vs について but I found more terms that are more or less the same to me. All phrases seem to be some kind of topic marker that can be roughly translated to "regarding" or oftentimes "in" but I couldn't find a dictionary that discusses nuance or usage.Sample sentences from Tatoeba/EDICT:に関して心理学に関しては、彼は専門家だ。 In the matter of psychology, he is an expert.私たちはこの問題に関して合意に達することが出来るだろうか。 Can we reach a consensus on this issueに対して彼は私の質問に対してうなずいた。 He nodded in response to my question.彼はまだあなたの行為に対して腹を立てている。He is still angry with you for your conduct.において復讐において、恋愛において、女は男よりも野蛮である。 In revenge and in love, woman is more barbarous than man is.教育において試験が大きな役割を果たしている。 Examinations play a large part in education.について法廷は彼のその殺人容疑について無罪とした。The court acquitted him of the charge of murder.過去の動作については過去形を用います。 "Past tense" is used in connection with actions in the past.における中東における現在の情勢は、緊迫した政情不安となっている。 The current situation in the Middle East is a time bomb of tensions.彼の発見は輸送における革命をもたらした。 *His discovery gave rise to a revolution in transport. *Related:にかんして vs について において vs における

I've noticed that there are 2 ways (at least, maybe more) of writing ふるさと (home town, birthplace):古里故郷Am I correct Are they interchangeable Is one used more often than another
I do know that there are many questions like that all over the web and some on japanese.stackexchange as well. Nevertheless, as far as I can remember I could not find any that explained how to choose the right kanji when there are multiple choices (I mean: 飛ぶ "fly" vs. 跳ぶ "leap"; 分かる (the generic one) vs. 判る "distinguish" vs. 解る "understand", and countless others like 暖かい・温かい, 下ろす・降ろす, etc.).The only place where I have found some explanation is in the MS IME for Japanese. But it is not very convenient because I am not always on Windows and when I do handwriting I do not have that aid.So I am asking whether you know a book, a paper or whatever else that will describe the differences between those words.
I have just started learning Japanese, so if it's possible, please explain fully and clearly with the knowledge that I am a complete beginner in regards to Japanese grammar and vocabulary. At this point, all I know is the hiragana, katakana, and various kanji (I know Mandarin). However, Japanese grammar is so different compared to English and Mandarin. I would greatly appreciate an explanation of the Japanese text:それで？ いつになれば俺のお嫁さんになってくれる？This was a dialogue in a game (I believe), however I don't know the overall context of this text.　The text was a bit blurry, so I'm not sure if it was ば　or ぱ* it is ば. Please correct my attempt at translation. To my understanding, in English it is something like:And so　When to become my bride...　do for me/let me have（And the "I" is a male） I believe he is talking to a female.  Is it about a man asking a woman to be his bride Or something similar I'm very confused.
みたい as in like (someone)If I want to say "I like people like that woman", is it enough to simply say: 女性みたいな人が好きです。Or do I have to specify the "that" part by putting it like this:あの女性みたいな人が好きです。Also, is it allowed to use を instead of が here if it ended with a verb (好き is an adjective if I remember right)
How are Japanese company division, section or  department names usually translated to English e.g. 「システム開発1部ソリューション１課」 Does it translate it to System Development Department 1 Solution Section 1
I'm a bit confused about ～としたら and its exact usage. What is the difference between this and other structures expressing "if" (～なら, たら-form, etc.)For example, let's take a sentence from one of my textbooks. If I used ～なら, does it have the same meaningその話が本当だとしたら、うれしいです。その話が本当なら、うれしいです。Another example: do those two sentences express the sameここでライオンに出会ったとしたらどうしますか。ここでライオンに出会ったらどうしますか。
On the surface, many Japanese-English dictionaries define both する and やる as "to do", with little extra context.  Offhand, I know the following:やる and する are not interchangeable when it comes to する verbs (e.g. × 死亡やる)やる also has a number of additional senses along the lines of "to give", especially where the recipient is an inferiorSetting aside the second point for now, what's the 使い分け for the two words in the context of "to do"
Good Day!I am currently translating a Japanese document and I encountered a problem.I can't find a way to parse 従がって強制 in this sentence:この文書はChartis SDLCによるHigh Level Designフェイズに従がって強制されている。I currently have:This document __ in the High Level Design Phase according to Chartis SDLC.Thanks. :)
I've been trying to find out the difference between these four lately but whenever I look up any of them in a Japanese Dictionary, the only thing on the page is the other three options with no explanation.Is there any way to separate them by nuance Also, for example, if I was to say: オレンジジュースが欲しいですか。それとも、コーヒーが欲しいですか...why does it sounds like it is all inclusive The combination of the particles "と" and "も" kind of makes it sound like you can have both at the same time. Sort of like 両親とも教師です。Or is it saying "Both at the same time are an option"
I am aware that some Japanese words can be written in either kana or kanji and that the rules about it are not set in stone. This has already been discussed in some questions and answers here (e.g. Usage of kanji for words usually written in kana) but my question is more specific.My question is about why sometimes the same word would appear once written in kanji and once written in kana very close to each other. For example, in Haruki Murakami's story I'm reading now (「かえるくん、東京を救う」), there's two different way of spelling of 何/なに and 僕/ぼく within the same short paragraph. This is a continuous utterance by the same one character in the story.みみずくんがその暗い頭の中で何を考えているのか[...][...]彼はなにも考えていないのだと僕は推測します。ぼくには説明のつけられないことです。Why is it spelled differently like that Does it have any meaning Is it just style The sentences with 「考えている」 are very similar to each other, yet 何/なに is spelled differently.The same difference in spelling is not limited to those words or this paragraph. It happens throughout the story and affects different words.UPDATEI feel that the answers below, while helpful, didn't really provide the ultimate answer to my question (or maybe such an answer just doesn't exist). I especially feel that concentrating on ぼく written with kana to mean childish language is not on the mark as the context of the story doesn't suggest that (I don't blame the helpful people who answered the question for that - they don't know this context).I can also add an example from another story 「蜂蜜パイ」 from the same collection of short stories. Again two different ways of spelling are in the same passage, close to each other, spoken by the narrator this time.[...]今度は左手を袖の中にひっこめた。  それはすぐに袖の中に引っ込められ、[...]
Could anyone please help me translate this I have only gotten a hang of basic sentences but this one I just cannot seem to understand. 疑いはいらない。それだけが真実  Utagai wa iranai. Sore dake ga shinjitsu.I am mainly confused about what function それだけ has in this sentence.
My friend and I were talking, and they had an interesting question. How do you establish that something implies something else in Japanese - specifically in the form A implies BThe research I've done has given me the form:A は B を[意味]{いみ}する。But this feels very strange. From what I can tell, that translates to "A does B's meaning," which isn't really what I'm trying to say.For instance, I tried translating: "My title implies that I am a doctor."Which came out to:私のタイトルは、私は[医者]{いしゃ}だということを[意味]{いみ}します。This seems like an odd and roundabout translation, especially with the use of だということ. How could this be said better Is there a standard way of saying "A implies B"
When would one be used I don't understand the difference between them.
I'm working with a computer translation program and the output I got was this:ぞれは一般的です。I'm trying to determine whether this is a correct translation for 'That is common.' Alc gives  誰でも知っている［やっている・使っている］一般的 when I look up common, which has me thinking that the sense of the sentence is wrong.The source sentence is: 'This type of implementation of the &lt;do&gt; tag on mobile devices is very common'.
I have read about the different uses of the different particles in Japanese but often become confused as to how it should be translated in different sentences. In other words the actual intent of the particle sometimes looks ambigious to me. Now the particle と has atleast these four uses:1) Quotation particle. It could be quoting a thought or speach.2) Conditional particle. It expresses natural cause and effect statements only.3) List of things. It can be used to express the word "and" for an exhaustive list of things.4) With. Expressing relationship between two things, translated as "with" in English.Now often I get confused which way the particle is being used when we have sentence before and also after the particle.If I have just one sentence ending verb after the particle like 書く、思う、話す、言う、then I know we are quoting something. If we have list of nouns seperated by と then we know that here we have an exhaustive list of things. The problem is that while this is true, the particle is used in more complex situations as well with in paragraphs and then sometimes I cannot make out how to translate it.Could you elaborate on how to know for sure which way the particle is being used
I'm learning how to introduce myself and am trying to figure out the basic grammar. I know that in Japanese the subject is often left off if it's clear what is being spoken of. I'm not too sure, however, whether it's unambiguous in this instance - do I need the subject for '(Senkou wa) bungaku to kogaku desu' Here is my passage:わたし の なまえ は ハリエット です。二十 さい です。さんねんせい です。ぶんがく と こがく です。しゅっしん が オｸランド です。Sorry, I know very little kanji.I have a few more questions. I'll put them below, but let me know whether I should remove them and make separate posts.Is 'bungaku' correct for an English major, or should I say 'eigo' Does 'eigo' make it sound like I'm studying English linguistics / English as a second languageCan I say 'bungaku to kogaku sannensei desu', or do I need to have separate clauses for my year and majorIs 'shusshin ga okurando desu' correct I've never encountered this phrase before now, when I was trying to find a translation for 'My hometown is Auckland'.Thank you for any help!
I recently boasted to a native speaker that I can pronounce Japanese with a high degree of precision, while he has trouble with pronouncing the "L" sound in English. Later in the discussion he stopped me and insisted that I was mistaking a Japanese pronunciation. He said: '黒海{こっかい}’ is pronounced differently than '国会{こっかい}’(1) I don't believe him. Is there really more than one way to pronounce "こっかい”, or any other word Every word can be written in kana, and kana pronunciation is not ambiguous(2) Is it even possible for Japanese to have the concept of a heteronyms A heteronym must be written the same way and pronounced differently. But, almost every Japanese word can be written two different ways: kana and kanji. Without a unique way to write a word, heteronyms don't make senseIs this a valid assertion: "The Japanese language does not support the concept of 'heteronyms'." maybe this page needs to be updated and improved http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Japanese_heteronymsthank you.

Two Japanese-fluent characters in an English novel I'm reading are talking about a specific heart problem one character concealed from medical exams. That character is requesting the second character keep this secret, lest they be kicked off the mission.The second character drops briefly into Japanese:"Watakushi no doryo wa, wakarimasu," Nicole said kindly, changing into Japanese to show sympathy for her colleague's anguish.Both characters are fluent, and I believe the writer was as well. One of the problems here is whether "doryo" should be written どりょ or どりょう - this would help with translation. However, none of the translation services I've tried actually seem to translate this in any way which makes sense. The closest I've gotten from Google has been "magnanimity" - but I don't think this makes contextual sense.What is the meaning of this statement, and how should "doryo" be written in hiragana

I was talking to a friend and he said he didn't like AKB48! I'm shocked, because AKB48 is so popular in Japan!

Because I am half-Swedish, I usually joke about this to other people. But now, I don't really know how to say it in Japanese!Maybe...話すのとき、歌のように聞こえる。。。

What do Japanese young people exactly mean by 「セクハラ」Do they think it is negative, or only slightly negative, or not negativeI've often heard Japanese university students throw around the term 「セクハラ」 as something which they accuse each other of or remark that someone did to them, but do not seem to be implying behaviors that are illegal, an unethical violation of human rights, or particularly offensive or negative (like the English definition of "sexual harassment" would). The Japanese casual use of this term does not seem to mean unwelcome bullying or coercion of a sexual nature, sexist language, promise of reward for sexual favors, sexual abuse, or sexual assault.  I have heard it used involving a girl acting as if she is reaching out to touch another girl's chest but doesn't go through with it.  I have heard it used when a girl pounced on the back of a boy and kept hugging him from behind despite his protests.When I tried Googling 「セクハラ」 I only found websites defining it in a serious and legal way.I want to explain to my Japanese students that they should be careful with this term when speaking with internationals or abroad, as it is not appropriate in English to lightheartedly refer to oneself as inflicting or undergoing any sort of harassment.  I think I could explain this better to them if I can better understand what they mean by the term.Thank you!
I know that the traditional Japanese style pubs that serve food as well as drinks are called "居酒屋".But once a few years ago in Yamagata city, and last night here in Kagoshima city, I ended up in a kind of place where there are many small stalls, not really strong permanent buildings, sharing an area, perhaps sometimes even sharing common walls but I'm not positive on that note. Each stall is basically like an izakaya serving drinks and food with only a small number of seats for customers. Some have an additional one or two tables just outside the stall.The area could contain a dozen or maybe twenty of these stalls.Is this whole area referred to as "izakaya" too Are the individual stalls "izakaya"s Or is "izakaya" only for the more permanent pubsIf there not specific terms dedicated to these areas and establishments, how would you normally talk about them in Japanese I'm interested in words or phrases for both the individual establishments / stalls, and for the area which has a collection of them.
So there's a character in a manga that says this:空想だけで何でもできちゃう奴を見ちまうと 何にもできねえ方がどんだけ平和だろうと思うぜNow the 方 in the text has the furigana of ほう. So if I'm not mistaken that means "way/side/direction". But it seems that the furigana makes more sense as かた, so it would mean person. So with that said, how is the phrase 何にもできねえ方 supposed to be translated/understoodLink to source

The English word "funny" means "something that makes one laugh". What is/are the closest Japanese word/words that match the meaning and the nuance of the word "funny" Two possible matches are 楽しい【たのしい】 and 面白い【おもしろい】. However, 楽しい is more like "fun" and 面白い is more like "interesting". There is also 可笑しい【おかしい】, which in my experience is often used with negative connotations. The word "funny" can also have negative connotations, but is usually positive. Another possible match is 滑稽 but this seems to have the sense of "extremely funny".
When I was learning about 持ってくる【もってくる】 in college we did some roleplaying to practice using it.  When my turn came up it was a husband and wife, with a line along the lines of the following:あなたはビールを持ってこい。(Context: I was playing the husband, saying this to the wife, played by a fellow classmate.)Deciding to use my broader vocabulary and try to make the dialogue sound more natural, I decided to try substituting お前 for あなた.  This produced an extremely unpleasant look from my professor, with a request to see her in her office after class.  Upon arriving in her office, the lecture basically amounted to "I don't know what kinds of things you read on your own time, but don't ever use that word again!"Was I seriously misusing the word, was she overreacting, or was it a bit of both
I've got a question about this part - それらの音が、世界の中心にあることを思い知らされ. I cannot understand why it's used passive form verb（思い知らされる） and それらの音が. If I'm understanding correctly, the ones who "make you realize something are those sounds"So, is it a mistake here, some sort of "author's stylistic" or I'm just misunderstanding somethingいつもは車の音や街の音にかき消されてしまう、世界の囁き。それらの音が、世界の中心にあることを思い知らされ、だから、人の世界の不在を強く実感してしまうのだ"The world's whisper, which is always erased by the sounds of cars and  streets. Those sounds makes you realize, that you are in the center of  the world, that is why..."
I don't know what の頃【ころ】 means in this sentence. I know ころ means 'about' or 'around' but I still don't understand its use here. ロンドンに来たばかりの頃【ころ】、私は「Chip Butty」を知りませんでした。My best translation: I've just come back from london and I didn't know what a Chip Butty was.

Apart from learning Japanese language, I've also started learning Japanese calligraphy (書道). I have a question about 草書 style (cursive style in English) calligraphy.Most 草書 style kanji seem unintelligible to me as they look very different to more readable normal 楷書 or 行書 styles. Can an average Japanese person read 草書 style If yes, do they learn it  (in school or elsewhere)As a sample, I'll include one of my attempts - sorry for not best quality and teacher's markings. Can that be understood by an average Japanese personNote: my question is not about what is written above. It's a question about readability of 草書 style in general.

This answer got me wondering how relevant the presentation in 万葉仮名 is to finding a 漢字 for a given word.As far as I understand, 万葉仮名 are used largely for phonetic value. Knowing that some word was written with some combination of 万葉仮名 would only carry any significance if words were written consistently with the same characters. Do texts in 万葉仮名 indeed choose 万葉仮名 consistently or is a lot of the choice a stylistic choice on part of the author
One thing I've never fully gotten a grasp on is the 〜はる form of "敬語", and I have some questions about it.Is it official 敬語 recognized by the 文部省, or is it just more of a regionally accepted politenessWhat regions even use this form commonlyWhat is its politeness level, and how does it compare/fit it with 丁寧語・尊敬語・謙譲語I was once stopped in Osaka by the police (because my bicycle was clearly stolen &lt;/sarcasm&gt;) and they used it toward me - どこで買わはりました？Which はる is this, and how did it evolve to this usage of politenessApologies if this is too many questions for one topic.
I was wondering what the difference is between 経験 and 体験 I've come across both terms a couple of times, and I know they both mean 'experience', but what is the difference between the twoBased on the kanji, I would guess that 体験 relates more to a personal experience Maybe it's only used for your own experience
Out of all sentence ending particles, I cannot really pinpoint what や means. I don't meet it often (or maybe I don't have enough experience or exposure) and in situations which don't really explain themselves. Also, is it a real particle anywaySome examples I recently found (from books):「くつろいでくれや」「それが実はアイロンではないからや」I hope those examples make sense without the context. I know that those kind of particles are hard to explain but any explanation is welcome.

I was recently watching a few videos about 橋本環奈｛はしもとかんな｝, and I came across an introduction (if it can be called that) that I've never heard before. Whenever she introduces herself, she finishes with, 「神様、仏様、環奈様！」(example)I did some research, and found a blog post which mentions it's usage as a chant at Japanese baseball games, but I had trouble finding any other information.So my question is, when you say it yourself, does it have the same meaning as when it is used as a chant I can translate it literally, but what does it really mean in both cases Are there some implications to it, or can I use this construction myself when I feel like being a little facetious
Last week I've stumbled upon a japanese song and have been struggling with the translation ever since.

I'm reading Murakami Haruki's ノルウェイの森 and, although I've come across many sentences I haven't been able to grasp too clearly, I recently came across one that was also funny to pronounce. Can anyone help me make sense of why Murakami might have written the following sentence as he did私がここを出てったって待っててくれる人もいないし、受け入れてくれる家庭もないし、たいした仕事もないし、殆ど友だちもいないし。I understand the general meaning/feeling of that sentence, but cannot seem to understand why he would have written 「出てったって待ってて」. From what I can gather it should be something like: 出て行ったって待っていて but that rases a question, what's that extra って doing next to the 行った Normally that would imply that someone else referred it to the speaker (eg. 出て行ったと言って待っていて) but this does not seem to be the case here.Would someone be so kind as to break it down for me pleaseThanks!

I was recently told by someone that you cannot use the polite form ～ます and ので; that is, ので must be used with the plain form. (Specifically, he was saying that 「勉強していますので」 was wrong, and had to be changed to 「勉強しているので」.)That sounded a bit dubious to me when I heard it, since I've seen plenty of sentences which involve ～ます verb and ので. So I went and checked online a bit. The majority of results I found were perfectly okay with using ～ますので, but a couple seemed a bit strange.This page downright says "don’t use –masu at the end of the verb", but doesn't explain why.I wasn't able to fully read this entry, but it seemed to talk about what I'm asking. Could someone just give a brief summary of what it talks aboutSo was the person who told me you can't use ～ますので mistaken, or is there some deeper commotion about this that I'm not aware of
I was trying to see how much of the writing on the signs in the park I could make sense of today and found something of interest.A sign stating what not to do in the park covered not littering and in that section was the turn of phrase タバコのポイ.I could find the meaning of ポイ online but so far not its origin. It means "throwing away" or "littering".As it's in katakana I tried to think of an English word it might be based on but couldn't think of anything. Of course not all katakana words have origins in English.A local friend suggested it could be one of Japanese's famous "onomatopoeia" words. But it seemed to me that just about all of those I'd come across are two syllables with reduplication, and written in hiragana.So from whence ポイ
As I understand, both よ and よる mean 'night'. I guess that the difference might be purely idiomatic. In this sense: What are idioms where only one of them is correct What are idioms where you can use either If you can use either, is there a difference in nuance
The sentence in question isそれはとってもいい話【はなし】だ。Which is translated as "That's a really nice story". I don't understand what だ is doing at the end though. 話 seems to mean story with or without it and Google translate gives me the same translation for the full sentence regardless. だ doesn't seem to be a particle either. So what does it mean here and does it act on just the noun or the whole sentence
In English there are a few idioms that are variants on the phrase,I don't really have a horse in this race, so...which essentially means "I'm not invested in the outcome of the current debate/issue/conflict."It's not difficult to imagine a non-idiomatic translation like 「結果はどうあれ、私には関係ない」, but that is pretty direct and lacks the softer indirectness of the original idiom.What equivalent idioms exist in Japanese to choose from for this
I just started trying to read the Japanese translation of Hermann Hesse's Siddhartha. I've struck a problem in the first sentence that my native Japanese speaking friends can't seem to help me with.... その友でバラモンの子なるゴーヴィンダ（典尊）とともに、生い立った。Both the English Wiktionary and WWWJDIC say 生{お}い立{た}ち is a noun.As far as I can tell, ～った is the plain past ending, as in わかった "(I) understood".What am I missing Is it something to do with this noun 生い立ち not really being a noun but rather some special kind of noun phrase compound made of two verbs (maybe even another 連用形) that has a meaning as a compound but can still have verbal inflections on the second partAt least this is the best theory after going over it a few times with a local friend and searching the web. It confuses Google Translate just as much as it confuses me (-:Before this my previous best theory was much more convoluted based on nouns and -na adjectives being basically the same so this noun becoming a past tense -na adjective - but that idea just seemed too crazy!
Is there kanji for しか as in 商品がひとつしかありません。
So this is from the manga Kochikame:Basically the guy on the ground was asking the cop directions while the cop was listening to a horse race on the radio and found out his horse lost.Anyway, in this sentence what does "スって" mean The closest I can find is "吸う," like he was absorbed in the race, but is that rightNext, "頭にきてる" is another phrase I'm unfamiliar with. This link says it means mad, so is this a set phrase or what word is きてる coming fromThen finally, what does "だてに" mean The closest I can find is "伊達" which seems weird in this sense. And "ぶらさげてる," in this context it means like his gun isn't hanging from his holster, rightLotta questions there, so I appreciate any help I can get, thanks!For accessibility purposes, I've included a transcription.  The angry policeman says the following:競馬で　スって頭にきてる時にゴタゴタぬかすと　本当にぶっ殺すぞ！だてに拳銃をぶらさげてるんじゃねえんだぞ！And then the man on the ground says:わっわかったす！
What's the 2nd kanji in the image belowI know that the first one is for oni, the second is 'mushi'.Can't seem to figure out what comes before 'mushi' though !
There's a famous old song that's actually the only ever Japanese language song to reach #1 on the US pop charts: "上{うえ}を向{む}いて歩{ある}こう".This is both the title of the song and a frequently repeated line in it.向{む}いて is the -te form of 向{む}く, meaning "to face".My understanding of 上{うえ} is that in Japanese it's a noun even though it's usually translated to another part of speech in English, such as "up".It seems odd from the point of view of an English speaker that "to face", "to look toward" would be a transitive verb requiring a direct object.Is that in fact what's happening or have I got it all wrong trying to parse this phrase due to my English speaker's intuition and my limited knowledge of JapaneseIs what I'm seeing more of a quirk of the verb 向く or is there something about the particle を that I haven't learned yet Or maybe it's all about the 上 in this case

This is partly inspired by the recent question on words with both types of kana.I am referring to words such as:39=さんきゅう＝Thank you  4649-&gt; よろしく、46 in internet slang  5963-&gt;　ご苦労さん  I know these are often used in telephone numbers (so for example a florist would try to get a telephone number containing 8787, 花花） It is part of modern vocabulary not something covered in text books.

Recently, I was talking with a friend regarding the 常用漢字表 as specified here I noticed that the 送り仮名 property of kanjis is not specified. She was a little puzzled, but concluded that the 文部省{もんぶしょう} does not standardize 送り仮名。Is this trueThis might be similar to the stroke count issue. Only the 教育漢字{きょういくかんじ} have official stroke counts as explained herePlease consider these examples:話し、話飲み物、飲物  So, for example, in theory could I write "表れる" or "表われる" or "表る" I think the convention is "表れる". Even though the conventions are very well-known and pretty much implicitly standardized, there really is no "correct 送り仮名" for any kanji, right
If I were to introduce myself, which would be betterはじめまして、あかみです。どうぞよろしく。はじめまして、あかみです。よろしくお願いします。How would you introduce yourself Any better recommendations instead of 1 &amp; 2 !Thanks :D
I'm not really sure, but after looking at some example sentences in Jisho.org, I came to the conclusion that in order to say, for example, "Out of all of the people that I know", you would say 「全部の知っている人たちの中で。。。」But is 「全部の知っている人たちのうちで」also correct Also, why do we use 「で」instead of 「に」in these sentences and do we even have to put a particle after うち
This is one area that sometimes dings me on tests.  While I can generally figure out what is meant from context, I only know a handful offhand.The question here is twofold:Is there a specific name for this category of wordsAre there any references that specialize in this vocabulary
In English when somebody offers you something or invites you somewhere you can just say "yes" or you can answer more enthusiastically in a pretty standard colloquial manner like this:Would you like to go out for dinner on Saturday nightI'd love to!Do you want a bowl of this soup that I just cookedI'd love to!I've asked a local but he doesn't really understand the nuance I'm trying to capture and offers me phrases that are more like the literal translation of "I want to eat too".Is there something colloquial and enthusiastic that's better than what my local friend has suggested
Obviously many Japanese words consist of kanji characters plus hiragana since the latter are used for okurigana:食べる水割り鷹の爪Recently I'v started to discover a few words that use kanji characters plus katakana too:段ボール紙パックBut I can't think off the top of my head of any words that are written with a mixture of hiragana and katakana. Are there anyFor the purposes of this question I don't include katakana + する since they are special and can be seen either as a single word or as pairs of words.Since "word" can mean many overlapping concepts, for the purposes of this question I mean word in the sense that dictionaries often have a dedicated entry for it. (Linguists call these lexemes and listemes.)
I English I can ask somebody if they've experienced or sampled a food or drink, or even an activity with this verb:Here try this and tell me if you like it.I tried koregusu once but I didn't like it.You don't have to eat it but at least try it.I like spicy food so I really want to try taka-no-tsume.You can't say you don't like tequila if you never even tried a good one!Non-food/drink examples:Did you ever try scuba divingI tried hitchhiking once but I prefer to travel by bicycle.I'm having trouble finding a word, phrase, or pattern, to express this sense of try.(I know it overlaps with the other senses of try in English.)These are the closest Japanese terms I could find.

Another question from me. Reading a text, I stumbled upon the following sentence:では、テレビがあれば、万事それで済むかといえば、そうではない。As always, stay safe and have a good day.
大辞泉 gives the following definition for 愛機【あい.き】:日ごろ好んで使い、大事にしている写真機などの機器。また、愛用の飛行機。Meanwhile, the 大辞林 第三版 gives the following definition:使い慣れて，大切にしている写真機などの機器。また，愛用の飛行機。Also, 明鏡国語辞典 (thanks, @snailboat) has:飛行機・カメラなど、大切に使っている機械。All three of these definitions appear to focus on cameras and airplanes (though they all do also have a など suggesting that other related things could also be called 愛機). My question: is 愛機 only used for these particular devices Would it be alright for me to call some other device (like a car or a computer or a razor) an 愛機, or would that sound weird (Basically, I'm wondering why these definitions identify specific examples of devices rather than using a generic word like 機器.)
Lately, I've been wondering about the meaning of a past tense verb connected to 上で, like in the 3 examples below:両親とよく相談した上で、留学することにした。家を買う場合は、十分調べた上で、決めた方がいい。よく考えた上で、返事をするつもりだ。What's the meaning of 過去形の動詞＋上で
The sentence is taken from a manga in which the character kills people at a TV station in order to threaten the world :おはよう世界の諸君...これからほんのわずかな時間だけ...Hello (ladies and gentlemen of the) world... for only a very short time...テレビにおジャマさせてもらう事にした。The first thing I'm not sure about is if テレビに is the agent of もらう and something like お前たちを is implicit: I received the favor from the television to let me disturb you.The second is　the combination of させてもらう and 事にする which to my understanding means "decide to" : is it a way of being ironic like I decided the TV would kindly let me (kill them and) disturb you guys.Thanks for your help.
I already know hiragana and I am teaching myself katakana now. Both are essentially two different versions of each sound, but I am wondering if there are actually any functional differences between the two. I know what each is used for (mainly native vs. foreign words, plus others) and I obviously know they (mostly) look different.My question is if any individual katakana are used differently than hiragana, for example differences in pronunciation, characters that aren't really used, or ones that act differently in certain scenarios. A list of any such differences would be useful to refer to as to learn them properly and avoid making incorrect assumptions based on my knowledge of hiragana.This question can work both ways, also asking for any differences in hiragana from katakana.
I've heard this story from several foreigners in Japan:I hired Japanese Company A for a service. I didn't like Japanese Company A, so I went to Japanese Company B in the same industry and tried to hire them instead. Japanese Company B refused to do business with me because I was already a client of Japanese Company A.What is the name for this practice in Japanese Is it called 企業連合Is this legal in Japan Is there some kind of law which prohibits this practice What is the law called Is it called 独占禁止法EDITTo be clear, this is a question about Japanese vocabulary. If I can get an answer about the vocabulary, then I can research the law. If anyone has any links to articles on this subject, that would be very helpful.
I was wondering, I learnt an う lengthens the sound before it. When I learnt the word みずうみ I thought it is a long u and saw it as a whole new word, but I noticed みずうみ exists of 2 words:　みず (water) and うみ (sea), the u does not function as lenghteing the ず but as the first syllable of うみ. I am a bit confused here: Do you say "mizu umi" or "mizuumi" as one word (with a long u)Thank you in advance!日本語の学生より。
To be clear, I'm talking in this case about double negatives originating in Japanese, not ones that are being translated into it.When I was in college, one of my professors taught the class to use [疲]{つか}れていなくない in place of 疲れた, explaining it as a face-saving measure by at least putting up appearances of saying you're not tired.  Is the resulting 〜なくない ending standard or valid  If so, is this practice at all common, or is was the professor passing on her own idiomatic usage  If it's relevant at all, said professor grew up in Osaka.
According to Genki, expressions of desire ( -たい sentences such as in the examples below) which use the particle を can also use the particle が interchangeably, and besides stating that, they give no further explanation. From what I could tell from searching around it seems that が appears to be a more natural choice (I could be wrong though). Does using を vs が imply a change in meaning Is one particle preferred over the other in these types of sentences Can they be used interchangeably 100% of the time or are there exceptionse.g. 映画が見たいです and 映画を見たいです, both of which should mean "I want to see a movie".
Closed. This question needs to be more focused. It is not currently accepting answers.

In a previous question about コーヒー割り I learned that 割り is a form of the verb 割{わ}る "to dilute".Now I'm trying to understand the grammatical process by which this 割り form of 割る can be added to nouns such as 水 and コーヒー.I've learned that 割り is the -i form, conjunctive, continuative, or 連用形{れんようけい} form of the verb. In fact it turns out that I keep asking questions about this form from different angles, not realizing it's the same thing each time!Now when I look up Wikipedia to learn more about this form and how it is being used in コーヒー割り I actually find that -i forms are usually used as prefixes.So this must be an "unusual" case since it appears to be being used like a suffix. What is this particular use of the -i form How can I understand and use constructions of this type generally
The other day after washing my hair I decided to add the Japanese word for "dandruff" to my vocabulary. It turns out to be an interesting word.It has only one pronunciatation, ふけ (fuke), but two kanji spellings and I got the impression from WWWJDIC this word isn't usually written in hiragana (correct me if I'm wrong).雲脂 literally "cloud fat".頭垢 literally "head grime".But ふ and け are not among the usual readings for 雲, 脂, 頭, and 垢.So are both spellings ateji Or what is actually happening By the way I can't seem to type them using my Windows IME.I also note that these Japanese terms don't seem to share anything in common with the terms for "dandruff" in the other languages Japanese often has many factors in common with:Mandarin 頭皮屑, 头皮屑 (tóupíxiè)Korean 비듬 (bideum)Okinawan いりち (ʔirici)This makes me think it was a Japanese word already before Japan borrowed kanji from China and the characters were applied for meaning, which would make it a case of ateji. But this is just a hypothesis for now that I can't prove.
Last week I learned to use あいだ and あいだに to express things that happen at the same time (are parallel) or things that happen while other are occurring. But I noticed that all the examples on the book (みんなの日本語 - 中級１ - Lesson 8, pp. 82) as well as the exercises and their answers use past tense, like this:電車に乗っているあいだ、本を読んでいた。食事に出かけているあいだに、部屋にどろぼうが入った。As I understand, in this grammatical pattern あいだ is used sort of like a "while". But can this be used to express things that are happening now or will happen in the future, while others occur For example, is this correct:あなたが映画を見ているあいだ、私は買い物に行きます。  (While you watch the movie I will go shopping)みんなが遊んでいるあいだ、私は働いています。  (I'm working while everyone is having fun)
I have the following to translate for class.病気になって  頭と首が痛くて  熱もあったので  銀行の隣の病院に  行かされたThis is what I have so far.I became sick and  my head and neck hurt and  I also had a fever so  to the hospital next to the bank  I am not sure what 行かされた means. I would understand 行かれた (went, passive). Is this simply a typo, or does it have some meaning I am not seeing
I always interpreted 何 as "what" and "どう" as more of a "How or How about" and thus was under the impression that if one wanted to ask "What will you do" or "What did you do" you would say 何をしますか and 何をしましたか respectively.However, I've recently started to come across どうしますか in Genki 1 which I naturally interpreted as "How will you do" but in the sentence 冬休みはどうしますか　it seems like it would be translated more as "What are you going to do for your winter vacation" Is this correctIn the above sentence would どう be interchangeable with 何 such that it's 冬休みは何をしますか  In the context of this sentence would they mean the same thing if interchanged In what ways is 冬休みはどうしますか different from  冬休みは何をしますか. Are there any small differences in the meanings that I'm not interpreting properlyThanks!
On the following reddit thread:http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/21l6aa/meaning_of_自分も信じてもらえなくなるってことだ/the following sentence was posted, with a number of people trying to interpret it:1.人の親切や発言を信じられなくなったらそれは自分も信じてもらえなくなるってことだI could not understand the point in question well enough to translate the sentence, but then a native speaker stated that perhaps there was a typo or a "creative use" of Japanese, and offered the following version as a more typical sentence, though different  in meaning:2.人の親切や発言を信じられなくなったら、それは自分も信じられなくなるってことだThis sentence I was able to attempt to translate as :A. Once you start losing the ability to believe in other people's words and kindness, you won't be able to believe in yourself.B. If you get to the point where you lose the ability to believe in other people's words and kindness, you won't be able to believe in yourself.A translation attempt for the original was the following:1.人の親切や発言を信じられなくなったらそれは自分も信じてもらえなくなるってことだIf you become unable to trust in other people's words and kindness, they won't be able to have trust in yours either.Do you believe the original sentence to be flawed or unnatural If not, does the translation make senseIf the first sentence is too unnatural or flawed to bother with translating, then how are the translations for the revised second sentenceIf the original sentence makes sense, can someone explain the use of 信じてもらえなくなる clearlyThank you, and apologies for the large number of questions and rambling nature of post.

About five nights ago I went out with a local friend to a traditional Okinawan club in Naha.We were of course drinking 泡盛{あわもり} (awamori) with water and ice.But the girl working there had a drink with us and poured in a bit of a can of coffee into her awamori.Tonight I'm trying it myself in the guesthouse after asking the owner if it's a normal thing here and not just a peculiarity of that girl in the club.He tells me it is popular in Okinawa and called コーヒー割{わ}り (kōhī-wari). Indeed I get Google hits and it seems the same is done with condensed milk in place of the coffee and/or 焼酎{しょうちゅう} (shochu) in place of the awamori.None of the hits were in English or if they were don't provide much information. There's nothing in Wikipedia or WWWJDIC.I don't understand why the name uses ～割り which seems to mean "split" or "divide" This makes it sound like the coffee is "cut" or watered down with the spirits.What am I missing Could it be one of those Japanese abbreviations where half a word is missing
This is my first question here and I'd like to ask something that has been bothering me for a while.Some words written in kanji can be read using both onyomi and kunyomi of some of the kanji and the meaning of the word stays the same. An example can be "every month" - 毎月 which can be read both まいげつ and まいつき. If such a word is written only, how does one know how to pronounce it For example when reading a written text aloud.EDITIt seems that the question is not very clear/too broad. Let me narrow it down and ask specifically about 毎月. Don't worry about any other words.If I have a written sentenceこの雑誌は毎月出る。How do you know to read it:この雑誌は毎月【まいげつ】出る。orこの雑誌は毎月【まいつき】出る。
Here is an example from the comic GANTZ. (This should be fair use of the image at least in the US as it's for scholarly commentary.) It's easy to tell that emphasis is being added, and the speaker is marveling at what happened, but it's not clear what it expresses exactly.
i know 逃す is like let someone escape (but you tried to prevent it),and 逃がす is let someone escape (but you didn't try to prevent it)How about the causative form of 逃げる, which is 逃げさせる？
This post is inspired by Tokyo Nagoya's comment in できる vs ~えます form for “can”, “able to” asking why everyone was writing 出来る in kanji in their responses.As I mentioned in my reply to his comment, I know my personal habit is to use kanji wherever I can ― both to reinforce what I know and to remind myself of context sometimes (heck, I even find myself annotating some texts to add kanji now and then...).  That said, I'm aware that there are some points at which it becomes ridiculous.  Nobody uses the kanji for パン, for example, and [天麩羅]{てんぷら} is usually rendered in [交]{ま}ぜ[書]{が}き.  I also find myself in the minority on some usages, such as [出来]{でき}る and [下]{くだ}さい.Are there any set rules or style guides determining when it's appropriate to use kanji vs. kana
The following sentence comes from 中上級の日本語 magazine for february: 新聞記事は、記者がコツコツと取材をしてデータを集め、それをもとに出来事を調べたり、関係者の話を聞いたりして書かれています。It is grammatically correct but I find the change from active to passive voice, ie from extensively describing journalists' activities in the active voice to connecting those activities to the topic of newspaper articles in the passive, quite jarring. Is this just because I am not a native speaker, who would find this quite natural, or is it just not very good writing (Given that this is a magazine for students of Japanese you would not expect bad writing in the explanatory passages by the magazine's staff.)
I've seen よろしく written out as 夜露死苦 on a couple of occasions where it's being used sardonically.  At first I thought it was just authors having fun substituting characters that sound the same, but it appears that EDICT actually has it listed as part of its entry on よろしく.  Is this just a case of a community-edited resource picking up junk along the way, or is there really some history behind this combination
I've always known the Japanese word for "chopsticks" to be (お)箸{はし}.Today in my usual practice of reading everything around me I looked up what was written on the wrapper of the disposable chopsticks that came with my supermarket bento:おてもとI was firstly surprised to find out that it's another word for "chopsticks", and secondly on looking up WWWJDIC that it has many variants:おてもと 《お手許; お手元; 御手許; 御手元》 (n) (uk) chopsticks (often written on the paper wrapper)From this I can see that it's usually written on paper chopstick wrappers and that all the kanji forms are uncommon, but nothing else.I'd like to know the origin or history of the term. Does it have any other current uses besides on wrappers, was it more common in the past And why does it have so many variants Obviously the initial お is the honorific that can also be written 御, but what about the two possible final characters 許 and 元
Can Intransitive verbs be used in Meirei form, Volitional form,  ください form and other formsAccording to my knowledge, Intransitive verbs are just used to state facts. So these forms should not exist. If I am asking someone to do something, the expression should use the transitive form of the verb.But in one anime (Bleach episode 114), when the hero sees his inner monster take over him, he says something which sounded like 「消えろ」. The English translation was given as "Disappear!"But 消える, which means "to go out; to vanish; to disappear", is an Intransitive verb. This makes me ask the question, can I use such forms with Intransitive verbsTo summarize, which of the forms work with Intransitive form and which don't Thanks in advance!

Plain and simple. The Jisho definition "by no means; never!; well, I never!; you don't say!" doesn't seem to coincide with any of the sample sentences I find either on Jisho or Tatoeba. Can someone please shine some light on the meaning and usage of this wordありがとうございます！
As per a "中学{ちゅうがく}漢字{かんじ}ドリル" textbook used by native speaker students in Japan, this is the 音訓 readings specified for "肉" and "皿":  肉音：  ニク訓：　none given皿音：　none given訓：　さら  Yet, at denshi.org this is the information provided:  肉、皿。So, I trust my textbook. Native speakers get to decide the specs of their own language. But, I'd still like to double check this. In fact, I don't ever want to use denshi.org again. A native speaker I trust says the site is managed by non-native speakers. I continue to use it only because it gives we quick response times (and out of habit).(1) what is going on with those readings 肉 and 皿 Which source is wrong  (2) what is the official character dictionary that native speaker scholars use A name, and a link, would be very useful to me.

I wonder if there is a certain meaning of 見 that isn't immediately obvious or straight-forward. 見捨てる and 見殺し both carry this idea that, through inaction, something bad is allowed to happen. There may be more that I haven't found, but I'm assuming there is a connection etymologically. It may be simply the idea of sitting back and watching these things happen, which makes sense to me, but I'd like to know if there is more then that.
I started playing the Japanese version of Ocarina of time and noticed that navi is spelled as ナビィ instead of just ナビ. I know that you can combine e.g. フ and イ　for フィ, but the one in ナビィ seems redundant.
Perhaps a dumb question, but something that I was wondering and couldn't find a clear answer via search. Since 校 is the kanji for school, why do we also need the kanji for learning 学 to say "school" (学校) As a westerner, it seems as though schools always involve learning. Is there some difference in nuance I'm missing Is there perhaps a historical meaning for 校 that is more like place of training or practice, which evolved into school
When a Japanese-language sentence is written out in all katakana, it's supposed to be either stilted, robot-like speech or something to simulate ALL CAPS.How is that with hiragana Does it make te text look like it was written by a nine-year old when all kanji are written phoneticallyAre there nuances in meaning when the same word is written in kanji or in hiraganaRelated, but not containing the answer I'm looking for: What does it mean if a sentence is in all-kana

Last year's JLPT tests were made available for download recently, and so to gauge my progress and plan what to study I decided to take the N2 test.  I'm right at the threshold of passing (58% overall raw score), so this is in large part an effort to try and figure out how to pick up some points in a section that is killing me.Specifically, it's the section of the test where they give you a sentence with four blanks and a star in the third blank.  Your objective is to put the clauses in answers 1-4 in order and choose the number corresponding to the starred spot.  Unfortunately the answer key only said which one was the right answer, so in the spots I missed I've got little way of telling where I went wrong.The first question, and my accompanying logic when I took the test, are as follows.  Please help me understand where my logic is off.問い１： 不調だった山中【やまなか】選手がついにゴールを決めた。彼に__ __ * __相当あったはずだ。したらというプレッシャーは「もし、またミスしたら」At the time I seem to have arranged them as 4-2-1-3, however the answer key said the correct answer was 2.  In light of that, would 3-4-2-1 be correct  It seems like 2 has to come after 4 on account of the quotative particle と, but that's all I've got with certainty here.
Here is the sentence :人数が多ければそれだけお前達が有利になる。I've difficulties finding information about this word. From the examples I read, it seems to me that, when used after a clause ending in ば its meaning is similar to the ば...ほど construction :人数が多ければ多いほど前達が有利になる。The more people there will be, the more advantage you will have.Is this what それだけ means in this case And if it is, does it have the same meaning in other constructions
Follow up question to this one : Sentence structure and meaningAbout this sentence :「ただしお前達の相手は私一人でいい。」It seemed to me that in Tokyo Nagoya's answer, でいい sounded a lot like でもいい : " Meaning-wise, however, 「でいい」 adds much more [than だ]. It expresses the speaker's agreement to the fighting rules that could possibly be disadvantageous to him. In other words, the speaker is already very confident of his victory as he speaks. "So I did a bit of research and found these : Is 「でいい」 the same as 「でもいい」http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar/mustThe first link says that でもいい has a sense of "something is better out there, but you settle for less" that でいい doesn't have. The second link says that "In casual speech, 「～てもいい」 sometimes get shortened to just 「～ていい」."So is でいい just the familiar abbreviation of でもいい or are they 2 distinct (though similar) structures with different nuances
I have a question about this character: 雨 I know each kanji has so many pronunciations, this is pronounced "ame" but it has other pronunciations, could you please tell me when to pronounce it "ame", when to pronounce it "ama" and when "u".
here is an extract from a manga that gives me troubles : (|| = column breaks in the manga)ただし||お前達の相手は||私一人でいい||一対一で闘い||私が勝ったら||次の者が||また　私と闘うのだ...First : can you confirm that there are 2 different sentences :ただしお前達の相手は私一人でいい。However, I will be your only opponent. ()And一対一で闘い私が勝ったら次の者がまた私と闘うのだ...We wll fight one vs one and, if I win, the next person will fight with me again....And that 闘い is equivalent to 闘って there (Which sounds weird to me because I learned that it had a litterary use only and the character is speaking informally the rest of the time, using だ instead of です, 楽しませてくれ, instead ot 楽しませてください and so on...)Assuming I'm right until there, I don't get what the first sentence means (especially why いい is used instead of a simple 私一人だ, but I found a lot of 私一人でいい occurences on google so...)。Or I'm wrong and で is the てform of だ and いい modifies 一対一で, and I don't understand it either : Fight a good  one vs one)Or, (thinking while writing), I'm wrong again and 闘い is just a noun and not the equivalent of 闘って and there is an を particle ommited after 闘い and いい modifies 一対一で闘い and then :ただしお前達の相手は私一人でHowever, I will be your only opponent, andいい一対一で闘いを私が勝ったらIf I win a good one on one fight,次の者また私と闘うのだ...The next person will fight with me again...
In my JLPT practise book, there is this sentence:学生{がくせい}時代{じだい}は学費{がくひ}だ合宿{がっしゅく}だとお金{かね}がかかり、就職{しゅうしょく}したらしたで給料{きゅうりょう}だけで生活{せいかつ}できず、親{おや}に頼{たよ}ってしまい申{もう}し訳{わけ}ない。I'm really just wondering about the part that says 学費{がくひ}だ. That seems like a strange place for だ. I feel like it should be や, as in "(things like) school expenses and lodging". But is ～だ～だ another way of listing things I don't think I've encountered it before if it is.
In my earlier question "Line of code" in Japanese I was trying to figure out a word for the following sentence:余計【よけい】な行【ぎょう】を抜く【ぬく】と状況【じょうきょう】が直った【なおった】。 "Once the unnecessary lines were removed, things worked properly."In the exchange that followed, it was pointed out that while the intended meaning is discernible, it has a distinctly translated-into-Japanese feeling.  What is a better way of  expressing my intent per the translation above
I'm looking at this table of classifying 漢字 into the types 象形文字、指事文字、会意文字、形声文字 (and 転注文字 and 仮借文字, but I'll focus on the first four for now).I like the idea of 見 "to see" being an "eye" on "legs", and the table agrees and classifies it as 会意文字.I also like the idea of 光 (and its traditional variant 灮) "to shine" being "fire" on "legs", but the table disagrees and classifies it as 形声文字.I appreciate that 火 might also play a phonetic part in 光, but can't help think that 火 was at least chosen partly for its meaning, too.Some of a longish list of other characters, listed as 形声文字, which I'd like to mean more:花 "a changing grass"  時 "temple bells announcing the time of day"  島 (or 嶋) "a mountain, where only birds live"  雪 "rain/downfall, which you can hold/catch in your hand"and my all-time favourite 漢字 (if only it were 会意文字):  風 "insects (mosquitoes) hiding in an enclosure"Am I imagining meaning where it doesn't exist or is this classification just speculation (or the classification scheme simply too rigid)
I came across this sentence written by a native speaker:(1) "学年{がくねん}ごとに学習{がくしゅう}する漢字{かんじ}が決められています。"  To communicate the same meaning, I would have said:(2) "学年ごとに学習する漢字が決まっています。" #1 is passive voice: "The kanjis that are studied each academic year have been decided."I interpret #2 to mean "The kanjis that are studied each academic year are decided."  Is that right If so, can I extend that idea to:"机{つくえ}の上{うえ}に載{の}っている。" &lt;-- same --&gt; "机の上に載せられている。"...[more verbs that have transitive and intransitive forms]
One of the cards in a Hanafuda deck looks like this:The character that looks like の is actually , a hentaigana for ka derived from the kanji 可.  The card says あかよろし, not あのよろし.According to Wikipedia, the meaning of the inscription (which is also on one other card in the deck) is unknown, despite the fact that the writing on another "poetry ribbon" card in the deck are known to be the name of a town.Is this accurate Can anyone with more knowledge of Japanese culture and language venture a guess as to what it might have meant Can anyone provide a more reliable, possibly Japanese-language source to back up the Wiki page
I've been doing a bit of work with rendering 縦書き【たてがき】 in HTML, and was having a running internal monologue in Japanese about how things were progressing when I hit on a missing word: "line" as in "line of code".  Trying to think of possibilities I came up with 列【れつ】 or 線【せん】, but neither feels right.  Perhaps just the import ライン instead  Can anyone shed some light on thisFor context, the sentence in question is余計な＊を抜くと状況が直った。
Often the weather forecasts will say something like晴れ　[後]{のち}　所により曇り　→　Sunny/Clear; later Partly CloudyIn English, most weather reports use more precise with time ranges, like (early/mid/late) morning, noon, (early/mid/late) afternoon, (early) evening, night time, late night, and I think most people have a good approximation of when these ranges cover (some likely overlap).Morning: 5:00-12:00  Early: 5:00-7:00Mid: 7:00-10:00Late: 10:00-12:00Noon: 11:30-13:00Afternoon: 12:00-17:00  Early: 12:00-14:00Mid: 14:00-15:30Late: 15:00-17:00Evening: 17:00-20:00  Early: 17:00-18:30Night Time: 20:00-24:00  Late Night: 22:00以降But the "later" that [後]{のち} uses seems very vague.  When I hear it, I usually think "afternoon on(ward)".  Is there an exact range it covers, or even an approximation that most people understand  Or is it basically when the new conditions start
I often hear questions where a phrase marked with は is moved to the end of the sentence:今の音は何ですか？何ですか、今の音は？I heard the second sentence above in the anime となりの関くん.  A student has just made a loud sound in the back of class, and the teacher asks this question out of irritation.My question is, how is an inverted question like this different from a sentence with basic word order  Does it differ in terms of emphasis
I had thought that for writing long vowels in Japanese, that small kana was mostly used with hiragana and ー was mostly used with katakana.I was actually thinking of asking whether there were exceptions but then when I looked up a word I'm interested in lately I found all these spellings in WWWJDIC:すげーすげぇすっげえすっげーすげえすっげぇNot only are there variants with ー and ぇ, but also え!In general, how do I know when to use whichAlso do I need to know which is needed to type them Assume I know how to type them if I know the spelling, but consider also the case where I've heard a new word in speech and don't  know the spelling yet. (Please don't tell me that's a software issue with nothing to do with Japanese.)
I've noticed だと showing up after verbs for a while now in various forms of media, such as blogs, anime, regular TV shows &amp; also when speaking to Japanese people. However, I was originally told that this grammar is incorrect, as だと can only be used after nouns - so what is going on hereAn example from a manga/anime called Prince of Tennis: Character realises he is about to get beaten up by another character - in a bid to stop it happening he says: なんでもします! To which the other character replies (angrily) なんでもするだと！？
I'm thinking about translating a recipe in Japanese and I'm kind of astonished that there isn't a wikipedia page for psyllium seed husk powder, but there's a brief one for psyllium. I'm not sure if it's even available in certain stores in Japan but I'm just curious. Upon googling, I've seen both エダウチオオバコ and サイリウム used for the plant itself. ( Example: http://www.wakasanohimitsu.jp/seibun/plantago_psyllium/ )But how do go about on describing it as a powder I guess know the name of the plant but the powder is from the husks of the seed...This is an example of how it's sold in the US:Although it's used as a laxative "緩下剤" - that's not what I'm really using it for. Its other use is being a water binder for gluten-free recipes: http://www.thedailydietribe.com/2013/01/5-ingredient-mondays-easy-french-bread.htmlm=1
Our professor gave us some problems where you are suppose to circle which statement the person is more likely to say. Below is an example.おまわりさん    よく道を聞かれます。    よく道を聞いてもらいます。I think this means the following.Policeman    I am asked for directions a lot.    I often have people ask me for directions.However, I don't see how one of these is more likely than the other. Is there a nuance I am missing
How does putting a の at the end of a sentence change the meaningFor example, here are some sentences:明日何時に来るの What time will you come tomorrow  昨日何を食べたの What did you eat yesterday
The character "⇔" is used in the definitions in 国語{こくご}辞典{じてん} to specify antonyms. I have questions:(1) Is "⇔" a formal character in Japanese syntax Or, is it sort of an ad-hoc way to specify antonyms At least 2 online 国語辞典 use "⇔" in the same manner, so it looks like a formal part of Japanese syntax.(2) But, my hardcopy 国語辞典 uses the "↔" character (the filled-in version). So, if both "↔" and "⇔" are formal syntactic characters, they seem to have the same properties. Both "↔" and "⇔" are really only used to specify antonyms merely as a convention (perhaps because of a historical reason), right  The characters would never be used in any other context to specify antonyms, or anything else, right If there are any good websites that have the rules of Japanese syntax, I'd love to have them. I've never really studied syntax.
In English we can express in several ways the idea of foreigners learning English, or teaching themselves something.My title isn't totally clear so I'm looking for the name of the topic, not what you call a person who's doing it.For instance, here are some of the common ways to express it in English:General, but on your own:Self studyTeach yourselfSpecifically language learning, with our without a teacher:English for non-native speakersEnglish as a second languageESLWhat is the equivalent topic called in JapaneseFor instance, what might be on the sign for the section in a bookshop in Japan with Japanese textbooks for English speakers
In my JLPT textbook, it has a section explaining the verb form [Noun]が[Noun]なだけに. By way of explanation, it says that this means, "unlike other things, [Noun] is special, so..."I'm having a hard time reconciling this explanation with the examples given.Here is one example provided:A : 部長{ぶちょう}に連絡{れんらく}しなきゃいけないんだけど、時間{じかん}が時間{じかん}なだけに電話{でんわ}はまずいよね。B : そうね。とりあえずメールだけ送{おく}っておいて、明日{あした}の朝{あさ}報告{ほうこく}したら？So... on A's sentence, we need to contact the department head, but "unlike other things", time is "special", and so it would bad to call It's just kind of nonsensical to me. B's sentence only confuses me more, because apparently we can email tomorrow and that's fine... so it's bad to call now because it's too soon, and better to wait and send an email To soon howAnother example given:状況{じょうきょう}が状況{じょうきょう}なだけに、家族{かぞく}の許可{きょか}をとっている暇{ひま}がない。とにかく手術{しゅじゅつ}を始{はじ}めよう。In this situation I at least understand what's going on. We don't have time to wait for permission from the family, we should start operating. Okay, but why Because the circumstances are "unlike other things" What other things are we comparing to Other options for trying to help the patient Other circumstances the patient might have been inIntuitively, to me it seems like in this case the way to think of 状況{じょうきょう}が状況{じょうきょう}なだけに is that it conveys an idea similar to, "the circumstances are what they are." In other words, we've got what we've got, so there are no other ways of dealing with it. But that's just my feeling and I've let my intuitions on Japanese grammar mislead me before.What exactly does [Noun]が[Noun]なだけに mean
When Dr Who is translated into Japanese, do they translate police box as こうばん I've seen こうばん in Japan, and they aren't anything like old British police boxes, so if that's how it's translated, is that confusing to a Japanese audience Or do they use some other term
i think my understanding of these two is getting better though i have a question about this sentence:新しい合金が開発された。医療用や通信用など、用途は広い。the が i think i get. it is because the new alloy is new information. the question i have is about the は used. what confuses me is that i recently read about this kind of construction:象は鼻が長い。it was explained as the nose being its own subject rather than a possessive. that is why the second part confuses me now because if anything i would think the second sentence would be constructed something like this:(新しい合金は)用途が広い。where the new alloy is now the topic as it has just been introduced as new information in the previous sentence and its uses are the subject much like the elephant's nose is the subject in that other sentence.is it a case where once you introduce something, you can kind of skip a step in the next sentence and talk about a feature of it using は for instance if you were to say something like... 象があります。鼻はながい。
死に馬にむちを打つ    -    beat ［whip, flog］ a dead horseAfter reading the sentence above, I was wondering when it's appropriate to use 死に to describe when something(or someone) is dead instead of using 死んでいる or 死んだ.
Is it possible, without any context, to tell whether 一二三 means "one, two, three" or "one hundred twenty-three"In English, this kind of ambiguity would be removed by adding spaces between each digit: "1 2 3".Is this even an issue in Japanese
This question came up from a previous SO postKatakana ダメ to end a sentence - emphasis全ての敵を倒す必要はないが、逃げてばかりではダメ。It is not necessary to beat all enemies, but you can't run away all the timeThe question was raised that this is similar to using ～ては　(いけない・ならない).ダメ gives it a harsher or more colloquial feel.Comparing all three in the same sentence, what are the differences in their meanings
服 by itself means "clothing" (e.g. 服を着る), and there are also some related derivative terms like 私服, 制服, 和服, 洋服, etc. On the other hand, you have words like 征服 "conquest", 克服 "overcoming", 承服 "compliance", 服従 "obedience", which I have broadly classed as being related to the idea of "submission". How did 服 come to have these two seemingly-unrelated meanings Is this a purely Japanese innovation, or is it like this in Chinese too
(I never thought I would ask one of these questions and even considered if it was off topic but this is a very distinct feature of the language as it is really used. Is it due to some characteristic of the language I don't know)I am to referring the condensed sentences/phrases that appear in the corner of the screen or as very concise versions of the what the newsreader is saying not the 字幕 that can be switched on and off or the "ticker-tape" style on BBC or CNN, which is always about a different subject. See link below for examples.I have not noticed this elsewhere in the world and wonder, does it date back to a time before 字幕  for the hard of hearing became very standard (25 years ago) or could it even be because people may not recognise the "chinese words" in the reporting unless they can see the characters (which would be good to know because I have the same problem!). The visual nature of the characters certainly lends itself better to subtitles than say roman alphabet.Link:https://www.google.co.jp/searchq=テロップ&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yZ8zU4_nD8fIlAXT6ICYBQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDUQsAQ&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=929
In the following sentence (from the Legend of Zelda guidebook I am translating) this sentence appears when talking about fighting enemies.My question is about the purpose of ダメ at the end.全ての敵を倒す必要はないが、逃げてばかりではダメ。From this SO questiondame written as katakanaI think that ダメ is simply adding emphasis. Otherwise, it makes no sense to me:It is not necessary to beat all enemies, escape is no good ()How do you all translate the sentence
I read that "Keri" is a verb suffix used to denote the realization of something, and is also poetic- I was wondering if anyone knew where it came from, kanji etc. For more context it was used with ari- like otoko arikeri. I think it was meant to mean "there was a man."
I came across a situation where I went to a volunteer class wearing a mask since I have a cough. My sensei told me "お大事に", and I did not know what to reply.In this case, should I just say "はい"Or is there a more appropriate response
What is the difference between 研究所 and 研究室 Do both mean a research institute
I often see って being used to mark a topic, such as in the sentence 新宿ってどこ？ I'm aware that this is more colloquial compared to the topic marker は. Other than the formality aspect, are って and は completely interchangeable in meaning when used like this
I'm puzzled by the bold part of the following paragraph which occurs in my Japanese learner's version of 雪女:二人は毎日、川まで来ると、渡し守に船で川の向こう側へ運んでもらった。  山から帰るときは、また、渡し守に船で川のこちら側まで運んでもらうのだった。My current understanding of this の+copula construction (my textbook calls it "extended predicate") is that it explains an action or statement based on the current context. So in this context perhaps it makes the storytelling more lively by directly answering a hypothetical question that the reader will ask after reading the first sentence ("but how will they get back"). Is that the purpose of this constructionA related question is: why is the sentence not written as follows山から帰るときは、また、渡し守に船で川のこちら側まで運んでもらったのだ。After all, the action (receiving transportation) took place in the past, and the story is read in the present. Or it the case that the extended predicate always "captures" any past tense of a preceding verb
I read that the kanji 金 ("gold") can be pronounced both as kon and as kin.When should it be pronounced kon and when kinIs there any rule about picking one or the other
The following is attributed to フジテレビHP／経済新聞. I wonder if someone could explain the grammar around the と (I think  it might be an "abbreviation" of として but it is very difficult to find an explanation of this.)総合司会タモリ(森田一良、６８歳）は..地元で「変人」と面白がられていたのを、ジャズピアニスト山下洋輔らに見い出されて１９７６年に芸能界[に]デビュー[した]。The MC Tamori (Kazuyoshi Morita, 68)'s act as an amusing eccentric was discovered in his home town by the Jazz pianist Yousuke Yamashita and his entourage. He broke into the entertainment world in 1976.(Items in [] were added to expand this extract beyond its newspaper style. The translation is mine so please feel free to offer improvements.)Revised translation based on feedback (further comment welcome):MC Tamori (Kazuyoshi Morita, 68)'s act was discovered in his home town by the Jazz pianist Yousuke Yamashita and his entourage  where the locals who got a kick out his performances had named him "henjin" ("the eccentric"). He broke into the entertainment world in 1976.
Given my understanding, it seems like "どちら" has the exclusive meaning of "which one (of two)" and "どれ" means "which one (of many)". Does どっち include both of these meanings Also, do all of these strictly mean which one instead of which ones Is there a different word to use when you want to say which ones
Just started learning Japanese again. My college offers no class on this so I am learning on my own. I have been using Rosetta Stone on and off again for a while now.One thing I have noticed is that Rosetta Stone uses は and を in basic sentences such as:おんなのひとは、おちゃをのんでいます    This sentence gives the Romaji:  onna no hito wa ocha o nonde imasuNow I knowは = ha  を = woWhy would they use those in place of わ and お
I always thought ちゃんと meant "properly" or "exactly", but I begin to think that its meaning is broader, more like "as it is supposed to be" or "as you're supposed to do" because in some sentence it seems to me that "properly" don't fit at all.The context is A gives a bag of food to B, and B says :だけどいいのか？お前の分もちゃんとあるのか？Assuming I get the meaning of ちゃんと right, I don't know whether the question is about ちゃんと :But, will it be okay Is your portion supposed to be in there too-&gt; Implicit meaning : Are you sure you don't want to keep your portionor about ある :But, will it be okay Is your portion in there too as it is supposed to beImplicit meaning : Are you sure you didn't forget to put your portion in thereThe context seems to lean strongly towards the first interpretation. Thank you for your time.
Is there any difference between 学習する and 習う
Why are we using から and not を in the following sentence:出て行く：同居している恋人が家から出て行って、別に住むようになる。I ask because the normal particle with 出る is を (eg 家を出る) so why do we have から here My dictionary has the following sentence:部屋から出て来なさい｜Come out of your room.Do the 行く・来る verbs which normally take から in some way dominate over other verbs related to the action if the other verb is intransitive
This is probably fairly basic but, not being a native speaker, I'd like to confirm if my understanding of grammar of the following sentence (from 中上級日本語, Feb'14) is correct and what is natural. In the following sentence I would have expected the subject to be the speaker and the object of the transitive verb 受け入れる (to requite), to be their feelings (気持ち), however their feelings take が and are therefore the subject: 失恋：私の気持ちが相手に受け入れてもらえないこと。Is this possibly because もらう is in potential form () or is it possibly because the sentence is nominalised by こと () what is the norm here and when would を be appropriateNotes:1) "An Introduction to Adv Jse Spoken Jse" tells us that for expressions of desire，mentioned in the comments,  for the ~たい construction が is "normative" but "を" is also used in actual conversation.2) Makino's Dictionary of Basic Jse Grammar tells us that for ~たい　form of transitive verbs either is fine but が is preferred if the degree of desire is high (perhaps a similar principle applies here).
how best to say that a kanji such as 句 has ONLY 音読み , i.e., there is NO kun-yomi.読みは音読みのみI want to tag posts at https://www.facebook.com/kanjirecog to indicate this without using romaji or English ... is のみ the best way to say ONLY here
The structure strikes me because the underlying transformation seems to be like this:[　あなたが　]　[　この文の　　～ところを　]　[　おかしいと　]　思う[　あなたが　]　[　この文の　　＿＿＿＿＿　]　[　おかしいと　]　思う　ところは～Another similar example is:[　僕が　]　[　君の　　～ところが　]　好きだ[　僕が　]　[　君の　　＿＿＿＿＿　]　好きな　ところは～This structure is unusual because the adjective 君の does not modify anything after transformation. The grammatical word order should have been:[　[　僕が　]　　[　＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿　]　好きな　]　[　君の　]　[　＿　]　ところは～Here is my question:Is it possible to say, 僕が君の　好きな/好きだと思う　のは、そういうところだ (I suppose no).Apart from と思う and 好きだ, are there any other verbs can be used in this way
I know that you use と for complete lists, and や for incomplete ones, but when would you use xもyも instead of xとy or xやy Doesn't も usually replace は or が Why is も used for lists at all
There are two 訓読み readings of 歳: とし and とせ. Looking at はたち (二十歳), a reasonable hypothesis would be "ち is a contraction of とし". I know very little about sound shifting in Japanese. Is とせ more recent than とし Is /si/ -&gt; /se/ (or /i/ -&gt; /e/) a common phenomenon
A well-educated speaker of Hindi (a modern descendant of Sanskrit) who doesn't have any special training in Buddhist (or Hindu) liturgy would probably be able to more or less understand the following short mantra. (As far as I can tell, this particular one isn't actually used outside of Shingon, but that shouldn't matter for the purposes of this discussion.)Namah samanta-buddhanam bhahThe Japanese equivalent of this appears to be:ノウマク・サンマンダ・ボダナン・バクWould an equally-educated speaker of Japanese without any special training in Buddhist liturgy be able to understand that mantra (or any such mantra; no need to focus on this particular one) Or is all this Sanskrit-derived Buddhist stuff more in the realm of a foreign language which one would need to learn separately

Improve this question                    I see the Japanese symbols, but never asked myself how hard is to write using these symbols. It seems very inviable. How do you guys do when writing at Japanese Is it really harder than, for example, English or Portuguese. I mean, the amount of writing required to express the same sentence.
It seems that Japanese has far more loanwords than any other language I've heard spoken. I understand that English is far-reaching and a global language, but are there many known reasons that English has had a huge linguistic influence on Japan in particular
I have an ornament, the picture, and I do not know what it means. I'm not even sure if it's Japanese but any help would be gladly taken.
Most people who've taken a Japanese 101 class know the 10 native Japanese numbers (一つ、二つ・・・十).  It's always seemed odd that a system would stop at 10 when so many things in life need larger numbers.  Are there in fact native Japanese numbers greater than 10
I thought I knew this but it has just been explained to me in Japanese class and now I am totally confused.I had always  thought と was "and" but apparently it more usually means "or"; when you want to use "and" you should use し at the ends of words Is this rightOr is し only for reasons Surely there are cases where its borderline if you're giving reasons
One of the listed meanings of the 推量の助動詞 「む」 on Wikipedia is that of 反語, which I understand to mean "saying the opposite of what one means for rhetorical emphasis" in this context (as opposed to just a literal "antonym").I have seen uses of most of the other meanings of 「む」 in my (limited) study of 文語, but have not encountered 「む」 used to mean 反語. What would an example of this look like
I've heard that should not put 一 before 千,百,十, for example, we can say:千円 or 百円 or 十円but not:一千円 or 一百円 or 一十円But we can and must say:一万円So my question is: Is it correct And why it's ok only for 万
To outline the context, this is from a Legend of Zelda videogame guidebook I am translating.I'm pretty sure the meaning below is that you should not worry about not being able to control the character (Link) at first because you will soon get the hang of it. But why does it end as 心配なく  I usually use 心配ない (さ) to say "don't worry" but why is this なく Is it some kind of slang-y variation of ない 誰もが初めて触るWiiリモコンとヌンチャク。最初は慣れないかもしれないけれど、あっという間にリンクを思いどおりに操作できるようになるので心配なく。
I assume that 死んでられない is 死んでる in the negative potential form, which means it would mean something like "I can't be dying" or "I can't be dead". Can anyone help me understand this better
I have a question about カンペキに in the following sentence. As far as I can guess it modifies the whole 「思ったとおりの仕上がり」, but grammatically I cannot understand why. Well, 仕上がり is a noun, so wouldn't カンペキな be correct hereお母さまを真似して作ってみたんだけど、カンペキに思ったとおりの仕上がりなの"It came out perfectly just like I thought it should!"
I've been reading into a little bit of more advanced grammar and am trying to get my head around the causative and the passive form. (yes yes N1 people. That's not actually advanced.)The causative I think I can grasp and the passive form makes sense when English examples are given. Using them and recognising them in practice will of course be a different matter….but anyway.One confusing thing was the similarity to the potential form. I saw a question elsewhere on this site which said you could tell the difference the bulk of the time since with the passive there will be a に。Which is fair enough.But then we come to the causative passive form. Which means someone made me do something (why does that need to be passive) and it made me wonder…is there such a thing as a causative passive potential formWhat I mean is how would you get across sentences such as “It is possible that she may make you eat her cooking” It strikes me that the double passive/potential makes this a somewhat iffy proposition.
人の手を刺す　　　　　　　　stab someone in the hand.  人の手に短剣を刺す　　　　　stab a dagger in someone's hand.What's the direct object in the second sentence Is it just 短剣 or 人の手に短剣 I ask because in the first sentence the hand is stabbed (手を刺す) and in the second sentence the hand is also stabbed but  短剣を刺す would make me think the dagger should be the one who's being stabbed(even though that would make no sense at all).  So did I make a mistake thinking just 短剣 is the direct object in the second sentence or is there another explanation
As well as the several other kinds of Japanese alcoholic drinks I seem to have found two words which both mean the drink known in the west as "saké".Now I know 酒{さけ} can be used for many kinds of alcohol in Japan. I thought the Japanese word for what us westerners call "sake" was 日本酒{にほんしゅ}.But just now another traveller came home to the hostel with some Japanese alcohol. One had the label 清酒{せいしゅ}, so I looked it up, expecting it to be for a different Japanese alcohol I didn't know about before.But the definitions on the English Wiktionary and WWWJDIC seem to be the same for both words. Is there a difference Is one a special kind of saké Or is one word more generic or more old fashioned etc
I have seen this term used a lot in many different ways.「さあ、忘れましょうその未来が」 saa, wasuremashou sono mirai ga — in this sense, I assume it means "come".But I have also seen it used as「でもさあ」 demo saa — which I would assume means "well you know" or some other expression. Would like to get some more clarification on this word.I know it is informal to use. But the actual meaning and when it is appropriate to use it would help.
I know that 私たち means "we", but in what sense Does it simply mean the last two people talked about Or does it always mean the speaker and the listener So say I'm talking to Shota about Sawako, and I sayさわこはしんせつですから私たちはともだちです。Is it clear that I'm talking about Sawako and me when I use 私たち from the context, or does the word necessarily imply I'm talking about Shota and mePlease reply in kana or kanji with furigana (私 is fine.)
In cases such as [第二次全世界戦争]{だいにじぜんせかいせんそう} or [第二次]{だいにじ}スーパーロボット[大戦]{たいせん}, is [次]{じ} effectively just acting the way a number followed by st/nd/rd/th would in English
I've been doing some researching on kanji characters, and was wondering if there were cases where already-existing characters were used as the final 新字体 form of a character.To clarify, I'm not talking about cases where several kanji were blended into one (like how 辨, 辧, and 瓣 all merged into 弁).  In the context of this example, I'm asking if 弁 already existed as a separate character in its own right, with its own distinct meanings.To use another example, were 閒 and 間 two separate characters prior to 1946, or was there only 閒, which was then simplified to 間Unfortunately I don't have access to a dictionary from that era to verify this on my own.  Does anyone else know the answers to this, or where they could be found
I have the following in a Zelda guide book I am translating. It is talking about being faced with a problem and trying various ways to solve it (you know the Zelda games).I am interested in "むちゃな". There is no kanji but I believe it is 無茶な. This is a videogame guide book and the target audience is teenagers I believe, from looking at what kanji is used and not used.そう思える場合は、大抵そのとおりなのだ。　あまりむちゃなアクションを要求されることはない。This looks to me like "bad tea" (which could mean "absurd" in a way).Is this the correct kanji, and is it common to use this kanji or is hiragana preferredDoes anybody know the origins of this Does "bad tea" really mean "absurd"if the next line helps:これまでに覚えたアクションと、ゲットしたアイテムを使えば、ほとんどの謎は苦労せずに解けるはずなのだ。
For years I have been saying それが人生{じんせい} in Japanese to mean "such is life" / "c'est la vie". In fact English has a few other ways to express the same thing, and so do the other European languages I am familiar with.Well my Japanese friends and acquaintances always understood, seemed to enjoy it, and never corrected me.On my current trip to Japan I also learned 仕様{しよう}が無{な}い as having a similar meaning, perhaps literally more like "it can't be helped".But only this morning for the first time have I been told that the first one is not actually a set phrase in Japanese, that it's merely the literal translation of the English (or French) phrase into Japanese.So is it true that only 仕様が無い is used in idiomatic Japanese or is it just that the person who corrected me just isn't used to それが人生 even though other people in other parts of Japan, or people of other generations, might use it in their normal speechAnd what about other ways to express this sentiment Since I originally asked this question people have added other variants in comments:世の中はそんなもんだ人生ってそんなもんだよIs one any more idiomatic, natural, Japanese-sounding Is this a sentiment Japanese actually express at all
I'm steadily learning the language, but sometimes I find these little things I can't really grasp. Today doing some reading for fun I found this particular sentence:彼奴め調子にのってやがりますから、我らでこらしめてやりましょうThe part about “彼奴め” and the “のってやがりますから” is the one giving me the most trouble. I can get a basic grasp of what it's trying to convey, but I want to be able to learn how to utilize that construction correctly in the future should I need to.Could someone please share some insight on it The context is referring to a group plotting against someone.
You know, as in situations that are clearly not crises.I've looked around but can't find an answer.
I'm having difficulty translating this particular sentence into English, and even thus understanding it fully. 私は成田空港で外国でも使えるけいたい電話を借りて来たから、問題がないよ。My best attempt at a translation:I had a problem at Narita Airport because I had to rent a mobile phone to use. I don't know how to translate the 外国でも bit and have it make sense nor am I sure about translating the 来た either.
I understand that you can use だい in the sense of "very", to emphasise すき and きらい. So だいすき is "very loved" and だいきらい is "very hated". Can だい be used for the same meaning in any other words Can you use it to modify all adjectivesPlease reply using kana (kanji with furigana is fine.)
I was reading a comic and came across the following usage of 勝 which confused me. この試合でオレを三橋に勝たしてくれ！I know what it means (Help me beat Mihashi in this game), but I'm not sure about how to parse "勝たしてくれ". "くれ" looks like it comes from "くれる", and I want to say that "して" is the connective form of "する", yet I've been completely unable to find a noun or suru-verb "勝た" in any of my dictionaries. The other possibility I considered was "勝たして" came from a verb "勝たす", but once again I couldn't find any such verb. What's going on here
I'm just wondering what does the word "ぶつまね" (or also ぶつ真似 as turned up by a google search) mean I tried guessing from the context of some 10 example sentences but still can't come up with the meaning of the word.My original sentence is this one:「先輩っ。ひっかけ問題はひどいです」ぶつまねをするテトラちゃん。The girl in question is tricked into answering "yes" to a question of whether a given calculation is correct. The answer she had been given is almost right except for a single number in it.Thank you in advance.Example sentenceshttp://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/examples/jn2/193338/m0u/
Okinawan definitely has a particle equivalent to the Japanese subject particle が.But I can't seem to find something like the topic particle は or the object particle を.Then again I only have limited materials and they're in Japanese, which I can't really read very much of.So I'm not sure whether this is a big difference between the languages, or there are such particles but I just can't find them.Information on these particles in any of the other sister languages of Japanese is welcome.(For the purposes of this question I'm only asking about these three particles that show the major grammatical roles of the nouns, I'm not asking about any of the other particles for now thanks.)
I have always struggled to understand the volitional form and translating into English.From a videogame guide I am going through, translating, I have this title:時には自分を疑おう”疑う” meaning "to doubt / mistrust". The meaning of the title is surely not "let's doubt ourselves" but probably more like "doubting yourself..."But then why is the title not 「時には自分を疑います」  For context, here's the start of the bodyある謎にぶつかり、解決方法がひらめく。　ところが　実際にやってみるとうまくいかない。
How is the title of the well-known cartoon となりのトトロ supposed to be perceived in JapaneseWhat is the device behind the トトロ Is it alliteration, word-play or something else
"I don't know how to use honorific language."敬語の使い方がわかりません。"Do you know how to make a flight reservation"飛行機の予約のし方を知っていますか。The above two sentences were taken from my homework -- which were graded by my sensei, so these should be the correct translations. My question, however, is why is it that in the first example, を is used, and in the second example, が is used Is it due to the fact that "わかりません" in this case is being used in the form of an ability (Potential forms use the が particle.)
I am complete beginner and I've got a question that I wish to ask you: When negating an i-adjective (-くない), should we, as in the affirmative form, omit the declarative "だ" For example, is it "あのゲームは楽しくないだよ！" or "あのゲームは楽しくないよ！". Thanks!
I just wanted to make sure that my understanding is correct.When saying Chapter 22, Act 22, or Episode 22 (basically parts of a larger piece), it normally starts with 第22 (or 第[number]) and then the counter. Right And 第 is another way of saying 目 Basically -th, ie.: fifth, sixth, second, first, ninth. So all I need is the counter for the word I'm using. For instance, the counter for "chapter" is: 章. And the counter for "episode", according to this thread, is: 話.Is my understanding correct
"Lorem Ipsum" is used as a place holder when creating designs or formatting media that will have actual text and functionality.  QuestionI would like to know what the Japanese equivalent is of this (if one exists) and or what ancient Japanese texts can be used in a similar fashion to produce "text that looks like actual text, but isn't understandable to the average viewer". Basically the same as Lorem Ipsum.
I'm a beginner in Japanese. At my classes I'm taught like this: とまる / とめる is a pair intransitive/transitive verb.This I understand and can memorize a table of such verbs.I can't help, though, notice a certain phonetic change pattern in all those pairs. To this pattern in my classes I was given no explanation.I wonder if there is any theoretical grammar explanation of that pattern for those Japanese verbs. Unfortunately, I'm not aware of any good Japanese theoretical grammar textbook. (In my native language and in some other languages I know transitive/intransitive is a lexical, not grammatical category, so I wonder, if that transitive/intransitivre explanation for Japanese is correct at all)
Recently, the が particle has been a little iffy for me especially with adjectives.Some nouns when modified by an adjective can seemingly use が　and は interchangeably while others cannot, is this correct Can you guys confirm my understanding here and elaborate/explain some of the nuances I may be misunderstanding.So, from my understanding the following 3 examples are grammatically correct and translate as follows. However, is there any fundamental difference between example 1 and 3 where one sentence uses は while the other uses が  What kind of situations would one use が as opposed to は in these types of sentences1.) アイスクリームが美味しいです　-&gt; Ice cream is delicious2.) アイスクリームのほうが美味しいです -&gt; Ice cream is more delicious3.) アイスクリームは美味しいです -&gt; Ice cream is deliciousHowever, there seems to be a subset of adjectives like 好き, 嫌い, 上手, 下手 and so forth in which は would be inappropriate and not make sense. Is this correct4.) アイスクリームが好きです -&gt; I like Ice cream (appropriate usage of particle, が）5.) アイスクリームは好きです　-&gt; I like Ice cream (doesn't make sense needs が） Thanks!
The Okinawan word for "Okinawa" is ウチナー, for "person" is チュ, and for "Okinawan" (person) is ウチナーンチュ.I'd like to know where this ン comes from between the part for "Okinawa" and the part for "person". Standard Japanese 日本人{にほんじん} doesn't seem to have an equivalent.Could it be a reduced form of Okinawan ヌ, the equivalant of standard Japanese のCould it be an "epenthetic" sound added in certain kinds of compound wordsOr something else entirely
On this site, when asking about でしょう・だろう, as well as ましょう etc, I have been told that it is a combination of the verb's 未然形 and the 推量 particle "う". However, I have never been able to find anything on it at all, I was wondering if anyone has read about it, seen any other examples of it and could link me to those.My question is, is this う particle realThe reason I ask, is because it would be easy to understand 泳ごう for example as 泳が + う which would mean that the action of swimming hasn't happened yet, but you are making a guess that it will.BONUS:Could this う　particle be related to the fact that all verbs end in う
As the title says: What does やっちまえ mean
A couple of days ago I purchased an old book published in 1908.It uses a strange orthography I haven't encountered before. Everything that is not in kanji is written in katakana, including particles, inflections, etc.Was this the normal way, or one of the normal ways, of writing Japanese at that timeThe book is a handbook of the Okinawan language for Japanese speakers. All the Okinawan is written in katakana while all the Japanese is written in Kanji plus katakana. So it could be that the author of the handbook made a stylistic choice because of the type of book and didn't use the normal Japanese orthography of the day.Here's a tiny sample:My camera is terrible at macro shots so here's my attempted transcription:和泉{イヅミ}屋ニテ　買ヒマシタ。
I'm currently reading the novel 「学生街の殺人」by 東野圭吾, and on page 230 the following sentence is spoken:「商店街の会費を臨徴して作ったんだろう？まさしく背水の陣だな」The character is referring to all shop owners of the district having pooled together money to set up a big Christmas tree in the vicinity in hopes of more customers.For some reason, I cannot determine the meaning of 「臨徴す」.　It would make sense to me if it was only 「徴す」, but why is a 「臨」prepended in this case
I recently created a web app called Kazu which aims to help speakers of Japanese and English learn to read numbers in both languages.I found a web page which said that 'for numbers over 1万, "1000" is read as いっせん.So, to be consistent with 一千万{いっせんまん}, I used 一千億{いっせんおく} and 一千兆{いっせんちょう}.I'm also using いっせん where 1000 appears in other parts of the number, so 1万1000 comes up as いちまん いっせん.I've tried to clarify with 2 native speakers whether these are the best choice for the app, and both of them said "it depends on the person", but they also said せんおく sounds better than いっせんおく — except when there's a counter word like 円 or 個.Now I'm really confused. If you had to choose one "best" pronunciation for 1000億 and 1000兆, as in my situation, what would they be What would you say for numbers like 1万1000 Should I change my decision
I found the following sentence in a document relating to this webpage:「お客さまの声室」受付時間を2012年11月3日（土）より以下の通りに変更いたします。My initial guess is that 「お客さまの声室」 is some kind of feedback room where costumer concerns are voiced out and catered for, but I'm not sure because I can't find an analogous meaning of 「声室」anywhere.Is "Customer Feedback Room" accurate Or if I'm wrong, what is the room for
I was browsing fairly random old questions to see if I could learn a few little things ( I could) and stumbled across this one-The topic is the restaurant, or the conversation is at the restaurantI understand the main thrust of the question OK. That's not my problem here. Where I am slightly puzzled however is in the く after 新し.はなしの種に、新しくできたレストランに食べに行ってみた。I realise this is an idiotic question however I am very very bad at grammar. Even with English it is only after I spent a few months teaching the stuff that I learned what simple things like nouns and verbs are. I want to get from the stage of reading and understanding towards understanding every little thing in a sentence however.I understand this く is something to do with 新しい　being a い adjective　But...thinking about it I can only recall 新しくない as a reason for a く to interlude. But that clearly isn't the case here.Why is this く necessary Why would 新しいできた not do

Just for a little bit of context:  There's a flyer about a Japanese church's beach retreat that's been sent around, and I'm trying to translate it for practice.  That being said, the flyer has been attached to an e-mail, and some of the earlier stuff in the e-mail seemed to be talking about how a couple of the details about the beach retreat haven't been figured out quite yet.Take the following sentence:でもリトリートがどんなものかは、スケジュールをご覧になって頂くと、一番分かると思いましたので、未完成ながらも送らせて頂きました。I'm having a little bit of difficulty with this.  I've put together what I'm hoping is at least kind of close to what's being said:However as for a lot of the retreat's details, since I saw the schedule, and since I figured it had all the important stuff on there, it's going ahead and being sent around, despite not quite being finished just yet.I know that some of the wording style is my own, but if I really knew how to translate the above, I wouldn't have affected the wording like that; this is largely to try to plug some holes in real quick while just practicing.Also I noticed 頂く being used more than once; I know that the speaker generally wouldn't ever use it to refer to their own actions, but I really had no idea where it fit in.What does the sentence above really say, and is there a pattern of difference between my translation and the real one  Thanks!
Those expressions mean respectively to pass and to fail an exam. I have the feeling that those expressions convey something that is not in the neutral verbs to pass and to fail. That is to say that 桜{さくら}咲{さ}く seems to mean "to pass with flying colors" and 桜{さくら}散{ち}る to fail but the person who fail is a bit disillusioned because of his/her failure.Are those guesses right And could they be used in a general sense of "to success / to do well" and "to fail" at a task or are they reserved for exams.I did some research and it seems to be that those expressions are used exclusively about exams (and especially university entrance exams) and nothing else.According to my research, the expression was coined by the Waseda university in 昭和３１年(1956), if you passed their exams your telegram reads サクラサク and if you failed it reads サクラチル. Some other universities borrowed a leaf out of Waseda's book and it seems that each university has its representative way to express "to pass" and "to fail" at their entrance exams (cf. this link)
What does the ぬ at the end of 立ち specify I can't find a verb that is just 立ちぬ, is this some kind of special form Can this be done with other verbs as well風立ちぬ, for reference, is Miyazaki's new film's name.
In today's endeavour to augment my ability to read onigiri labels I came across this in Naha, Okinawa:きざみ角煮Google Translate does a terrible job:Boiled angle incrementsWWWJDIC has an entry for 角煮: stew of cubed meat or fish (esp. pork belly or tuna)But I'm stumped by きざみ. Google thinks it means increment and WWWJIC has "shredded tobacco; notch; nick", which doesn't help much.I've also tried Goo, Wikipedia, Wiktionary. I wonder if there's a wiki or other resource specializing in Japanese food terminology as this is a particular interest of mine.
I know that もらう has the meaning of 'get' or 'receive', but I am confused with it when it is used in the sentence below:面白いのでたくさんの人に読んでもらいたいHow do I understand the auxiliary verb 'もらう' in this sentenceCan anyone help me translate the sentence to English, please
I found out there is a special kind of Okinawan tofu called 豆腐よう.According to EDIC/WWWJDIC it can also be written as "豆腐餻" and "唐芙蓉"."餻" seems to mean "cakes, pastry", but considering that this is from Okinawa, that it's not usually written in kanji, and that the other kanji spelling is totally different, it could also be an ateji for a word from the Okinawan language.Do we in fact know the origin of this "よう"
Today I bought a hundred year old book in a secondhand bookshop in Naha, Okinawa. It's a handbook of the Ryukyuan language in Japanese, though it has both Japanese and English titles there is no English inside.This is how it describes itself in EnglishBeing a Guide to Conversations in the Standard  Luchuan, to which is added 琉語解釋 written  by Giwan Chōho the last Statesman  of old Luchu,  1916The Japanese I've shown it to could not guess what 琉語解釋 means. The first two characters are obviously an abbreviated way to say "Ryukyuan language" (琉球語 would be unabbreviated) but the last two characters baffled them.Since this book is from the prewar era it must use 旧字体, older kanji forms before the simplified characters were introduced and many other characters were more or less deprecated in the language reforms / standardization.But another strange thing is that the book does not use the usual English terms "Ryukyu" and "Ryukyuan" but very Chinese-looking terms "Luchu" and "Luchuan".This makes me wonder if this particular phrase might actually be Chinese rather than Japanese
In Japanese, I have encountered 3 words for selecting or making a choice (so far).選ぶ彼はよい奥さんを選んだ。He chose a good wife.選択それでも、早期の退職を選択する人は多い。Nevertheless, many are choosing early retirement.選定例文の選定がまずかったです。 The choice of example sentence wasn't wise.(Sample sentences are from JDIC:ED)Are there any differences between the three Or are they generally interchangeable
Some Kanji characters are written slightly differently in the Mincho/Gothic typefaces or handwriting. Ones that come to mind are 令、心, and these have been discussed before  [1].This font-dependent variation is consistent when the character occurs as a sub-element of another character (e.g. as in 冷).Today, I encountered the character 賭 (as in 賭け, 賭博) that looks like it's consists of the sub-elements 貝 and 者. Interestingly, the Mincho font on my machine puts one extra stroke on the top right of the 日 on the right hand side.I was puzzled because the character 者 by itself doesn't show this variation. Thoughts[1] Why are there two versions of the kanji for 冷
I know the form ている, but is there any other form like just てる without an い between  This is the sentence that I'm confused with :写真の右に写ってる小物が気になります。なんやろね？
What is the difference between うまい and 美味{おい}しい when talking about food I suppose they can be used interchangeably in most cases, but when should I prefer one to the otherI've seen a number of examples where うまい is translated as "sweet". Am I correct in my assumption that one should refer to, let's say, spicy food as 美味しい but never with うまい Edit: in this assumption I must be confusing あまい vs. うまい when kanji is used.
Another traveller in my guesthouse in Naha thinks his local friends taught him a special local word for "cheers", that might sound like "kuri" or "kali".But the Okinawan owner of the guesthouse doesn't know this word. He doesn't speak Okinawan fluently but he knows lots of words as both his parents were speakers and he's in his 50s.In any case, I don't mind if it's a word from ウチナーグチ or just modern local slang used by young people.
In the Japanese exclamation:待ってろよ！What function does ろ have and how should it be translated to EnglishI've searched everywhere, but I can't seem to find a decent explanation. The only thing that came close was a website telling me that the て-form could sometimes be replaced by a ろ, but that's not what's happening here..
I'm studying for level N2 of the Japanese Language Proficiency Test and have a question about 限り.I find in my book that 限り meaning "as long as" can be preceded by adjectives, but in A Dictionary of Intermediate Japanese Grammar they say you can´t use adjectives before 限り.  From page 84:Adjectives cannot precede kagiri.*面白い限り続けるつもりだ。 (Acceptable form: 面白いうちは……）(As long as I find it interesting, I will continue to do it.)*上手な限り誰でもいいです。 (Acceptable form: 上手​{だったら／であれば／なら}……)(As long as the person is good at it, it doesn't matter who does it.)Can anyone explain to me if I can use adjectives with 限り
I'm working out my Japanese by trying to read everything around me, including food packages.On my milk carton written inside a large arrow pointing to the spout is "あけぐち" in hiragana.Obviously this is equivalent to English "open here", "pour here", "spout" etc, but I want to understand it literally, piece by piece, to improve my grammar knowledge and ability to make my own sentences, etc.So is this a noun phrase made up of just 開{あ}け and 口{ぐち}Is the ～け okurigana for some kind of verb ending Does it maybe change it from a verb to a noun so that it can enter into a compound with ぐちIt seems not to be regarded as a word in its own right as its not in EDIC. Surprisingly Google Translate offers only "akeguchi"!Or am I totally off the mark What would be ways to translate it into English very literally
In the context of real estate, what is an "オウンキー"I understand that it literally translates as "own key", but having a word for that seems to be like needing a word for people with only one head. Is it to distinguish from people who live in a place, but don't have a key to access where they live
Can somebody please explain for me the meaning of ばかり in とばかり思って, as far as I can guess through the examples it means something like "そう思ったんだけど、実際に・・・・・・".僕たちはずっと、彼らは一生安泰だとばかり思っていたんだけど、君の話によると、見た目より大変だな。We always thought they had it made, but from what you say, it's harder than it looks.彼はつい最近入った新人だとばかり思っていた。I thought of him as being a fairly recent newcomer.「いえ、ただ、こちらの晩餐会で振る舞われた料理のことは、皆が絶賛していたものですから。　だからあなたも真剣に取り組んでいるものだとばかりーー」Well, it's just that, everyone highly prised the food which was on this banquet. And that is why I thought that you're putting all your efforts into it, but--btw, I found one more sentence with some sort of interesting(at least for me) ばかり usage -「 あたしは、形とばかり並べられた陶器のティーセットに手を伸ばす。」, I understand that the meaning would be something like "the teacups was lined up just for show", but what is the point of putting と before ばかり　in this case
This is an example sentence from a set of learning materials called Kanji Odyssey 2001:北極にはシロクマなど陸上の動物がいる。南極には陸上の動物はいない。My question is about the bold. I understand the には I think because it is showing contrast between the two locations. I feel like the は at the end has to do with contrast as well... but I don't know Can you contrast the same thing And if so why aren't there two は's, why is one a が
How can I write the name Aimad in JapaneseAimad (عماد) is an Arabic name which means 頼みの綱 in Japanese and "mainstay" in English, written Aimad or Imad in French and Emad in English.It is pronounced [[ʕemæ:d]].Similarly, مجدو  which is Majdou in French and pronounced [[mædʒdo]].To listen to the sounds for those two words, you can try this website,just copy and past the Arabic written for Aimad and Majdou and choose Arabic as the language.
I've been reading up on the uses of the particle から, particularly when it is appended to the -te form of a verb where it takes on the meaning similar to "after [verb], [sentence 2]"However, when building this complex sentence I realized I don't really understand how a sentence should be built. For example, these are two variations of a sentence I came up with:ご飯を食べてから一緒に公園でさんぽしましょ。  "After [I] eat breakfast, let's go walk in the park."ご飯を食べてから公園で一緒にさんぽしましょ。  "After [I] eat breakfast, let's go to the park for a walk."Both of these sentences look correct, but the second sentence doesn't seem natural to me because it mentions the park before the noun "Issho". What would be more proper, and is there a pattern I can follow

For those (non-natives, etc.) who maybe aren't familiar, knock-knock jokes are one of the lowest, most basic forms of American "comedy".  They follow this format:A:  Knock, knockB:  Who's thereA:  [Something]B:  [Something] whoA:  [Dumb punchline]Here's an example:A:  Knock, knockB:  Who's thereA:  "Boo"B:  "Boo" whoA:  It's just me, you don't have to cry.　→　さぁ〜〜〜むッ！  注：「"Boo" who」とは「Boo hoo」の同音で、「Boo hoo」とは英語の泣き[喚]{わめ}きの擬声語。You can make up just about anything and fit it into the format of a knock-knock joke.So does Japanese have some similar ubiquitous format for making easy "jokes"
I took up an interest in Japanese and I have to say I'm enjoying the language overall.I've been reading online resources and have no problem with normal Godan or Ichidan verbs since they have rules you can follow.However when I look up verbs in the dictionary such as cooking, painting, etc:[料理]{りょうり},　[絵]{え}None of the online resources I've found tell you how to deal with these. There are a lot of words that don't end like the regular verbs.What do I need to learn to to begin forming sentences likeDo you cookAre you cooking
We've learnt that お is used for 訓読み and ご is used for 音読み. I want to know why we use お上手 and お電話.  Why can't we use ごじょうず and ごでんわ？
I saw in my Deathnote manga the sentence, 何か欲しいものはない？I also saw in my game I'm playing in Japanese "これらの絵でどれか気に入るものがありますか".I was wondering, why do どれか and 何か seem superfluous It seems like they add nothing to the sentence because if you remove them it still has the same meaning. 欲しいものはない？ for example. Does 何か just add some sense of non-specificity I guess it is because we are always told that どれか and なにか are nouns that I am confused, because it seems here they are working more like adverbs.I was wondering if perhaps the fact that we are told that 何か = "something" that I am getting confused... because my theory is that 何か is the "some" and もの is the "thing".Thus 欲しいものはない would be "There a thing you want" whereas 何か欲しいものはない would be "There isn't ANY thing you want"Anyone have an answer
While I know that 詳しい and 詳細 both have unique meanings, there are some cases where I am not able to tell the difference between them. Here are two I've stumbled upon:Adverbially:我々の研究計画を詳しく述べたパイロットはその光景を詳細に述べたAdjectivally:彼はパーティーについて詳細な説明をしたもう少し詳しい説明をしてくださいIs there a difference in nuance, or are they virtually the same
As far as I understand, the following two sentences functionally mean the same thing, "It's not easy" and "It's hard"やさしくないです。むずかしいです。My question is, do these statements have any subtle nuances Do the Japanese have a preference for either negating an adjective or using its opposite adjective, or are both methods used indiscriminatelyPlease reply using kana only. すこしかんじがわかります。
「～と言{い}いました」and「～と言{い}っていました」basically the difference between します and しています.
For example, I'm trying to make sense of the following phrase:二回後システムWhen literally translated to English, becomes:Twice After SystemI have also encountered a similar phrase:システム第2回Can both phrases mean "System Version 2" If no, what makes them different
As I understand it てある is rather different to ている in that it refers to a resultant state rather than an ongoing action.However I wonder, what then is the practical difference between a resultant state and a past actionFor example,昼ごはんを作ってある (昼ごはんは作ってある)昼ごはんを作ったboth mean “I made dinner” right Is there any major difference or is it some small nuanceWould てある not apply if you were speaking of something you did last week and thus the dinner has since been eaten whilst it would work if you were speaking of the dinner you're about to eat
Since サヨウナラ, when written in katakana it gives a more cool/deep nuance.How about ありがとう Do Japanese people choose to write it in katakana if they want the nuance of the word to look coolerIt's because I want to embroider this word on a material to express thank you. Will embroidering in katakana looks stupid
Here is the sentence (from the 日本語文法ハンドブック :疑問詞が　「が」　「を」　以外の格助詞を伴う時はその格助詞の後にそのまま　「も」　を後接させます。My guess : When the interrogatives are accompanied by a case-marking particle other than "が" and "を","も" can be added  after that particle (without changing anything else).1 : I don't understand why 伴う has a direct object though rikaichan says it's intransitive.From the examples I've seen, it seems to me that 伴う can either mean to accompany or to be accompanied by in the following way :AがBに伴う。A accompanies B.AがBを伴う。A is accompanied by B.If that's the case is it transitive/intransitive What does it mean exactly2 : I can't find any definition for 後接 (こうせつ) in any dictionary that i have except an example sentence in the 和英大辞典 which made me guess that it meant "to be suffixed by".But then, why is it :疑問詞が　「。。。」　「も」　を 後接 させます。The interrogatives let add もAnd not :疑問詞が　「。。。」　「も」　に 後接 できます。The interrogatives can be suffixed by も.Or :疑問詞が　「。。。」(自分を)　「も」　に 後接 されさせます。The interrogatives let themselves be suffixed by も.3 : Bonus point : Though I think I understand what they mean, I can't find any translation for 現場指示 and 文脈指示.Is there any "official" translation for these words

I have a long translation I need to do. It has basically talked about how the speaker's younger brother was very sick. The last sentence of the translation is the following.弟が、明日、会社に行けるかわかりませんが、  できたらもう少しゆっくり休んでもらいたいと思います。Here is what I have so far.I do not know whether my younger brother will be able to go to the company tomorrow but  if he can  I think I want to receive his action of taking the day off a little more slowlyThat last line doesn't sound right to me. "Taking the day off a little more slowly". Can anyone think of a better translation
I'm  currently trying to get back into studying Japanese. I want to take the JLPT N3 this summer. To get myself in the mode for this I am first looking at the N4 tests on the JLPT website.The reading parts and kanji comprehension are no challenge for me. I can get through the vast majority of that without trouble and where I do slip up I can understand why.Grammar however...grammar is the devil.One of the supposedly easiest questions on the test is as follows-わたしの父は中国語も英語ｘ話せますMy instinct was for the answer to be を. も means in addition, so you have to have an actual action for the も to be in addition to, rightNo. It turns out the answer is も. I fail and I don't understand the reasons. Can anyone explain why in this context を is incorrect and　も is rightIt is a bit of an unusual sentence and a break from textbook patterns of the additional も. The way I'm used to is one person says I like y/I come from z, and the other person says 私も. Its not a particle I generally see used too often in this also sense, where I see it its usually as a negative.To have the も come first like this confuses me.
For my phonology homework, we're given the nasals [n] [m] [η] and nasalized glides [w] and [j]. From the data, I've found that [n] and [m] are phonemes and [η] is an allophone of /n/. What I can't figure out is where the nasal glides fit in. They appear w̃ and ȷ̃. The exact question is this:source (section 3 on page 67)

I noticed that each time I get my haircut reservation to the day after the day conversation takes place, I hear the person on the other end changing the way he or she says 明日 from あした to あす or みょうにち, when he or she makes the final confirmation of reservation day. It happens pretty much every time I do the reservation over the phone, while I struggle to remember hearing people using みょうにち in normal life at all.It sounds like it is done intentionally as it happens every time and not limited to only one particular person, so I think it is either a company guideline or some general rule they are following.The only possible explanation I can see is that it is done to avoid misunderstanding.I know that 一 and 七, as well as 四月 and 七月 might be mistaken for each other when spoken over the phone and therefore might require clarification by using alternative readings. But using alternative readings for あした baffles me as I can't think of what あした might sound similar to given the context of the conversation.
Supposing I'm meeting a colleague's wife for the first time, I was trying to think of how to modify いつもお世話になっています to express something like "I'm always in your husband's care". Is this appropriate if so, how would I modify the phraseI've encountered the phase used where the speaker is thanking the person he's talking to on behalf of a third person - for example 息子がお世話になっています - and I wondered if it works the other way around.
Why aren't we referring to Yamada as Yamada-san in the following sentences taken from the answer to a recent question (which took them from site at:  http://www.e-hoki.com/column/current/68.html) where you are talking to your boss (課長）about a colleague of equal rank その件は、山田に御説明しました。…謙譲語Ⅰその件は、山田に説明いたしました。…謙譲語Ⅱ（丁重語）The first sentence is wrong anyway because the ごーon 説明 is unwarranted (see original question - link below) but in either sentence is it not correct to refer to others with ーさん In the second case the speaker could possibly be treating him as "part of his group" but, given we are talking to our section head, I would have thought we were all in the same group  My thoughts:Is it possibly because we are using 謙譲語 with our 課長 we therefore have to refer to our 同僚 such as Yamada without the さんIf this is the case then if we speak in neutral Japanese to our 課長, should we keep the さん？　ie:山田さんに説明しました　−　correct山田に説明しました　−　incorrect (or just a bit rough, because I don't think it is unusual)Recent question: What distinguishes 丁重語 from other honourific forms
In Kenji Miyazawa's poem "Thief", many words are left as hiragana:青じろい骸骨星座のよあけがた凍えた泥の乱反射をわたり店さきにひとつ置かれた提婆のかめをぬすんだもの　　　にはかにもその長く黒い脚をやめ二つの耳に二つの手をあて電線のオルゴールを聴くWhat does 提婆のかめ signify (I tried doing a few searches, but I can't tell if this is related to a shogi piece or an Aryadeva figure). According to this site, it refers to Datta Daiba, but that doesn't clear up the mystery with かめ.
I asked my teacher how to say "last question", to which she responded by "前の質問【しつもん】". However somehow I feel, 前の質問 refers more like "question that was asked earlier". Can anyone please explain how I can express and differentiate between the two expressionsSome examples:Type 1:The last time I gave you a chocolate, you said you didn't like them. (what happened now)Did you complete the last book you took from the libraryHave you guys figured the answer to the last question I gave youType 2:I have shown you earlier how to solve this problem.Earlier you said you like her. (what happened now)Earlier I used to do that too. (but not now)More specifically, I am trying to differentiate between references which can mean "a time in the past without any particular reference as to when", and "a specific point in past where the last occurrence of something was there".Additional Notes: I have read about using 最後【さいご】 to express "last time", but I believe it has a meaning of doing something for the last time (as in when did you meet her for the final time). Here I do not mean any of the activities mentioned above, is for the final time only.Edit: Any examples and explanation of 最後 usage to distinguish the nuances will also be highly appreciated.
I don't get why に is used in addition to は in the following sentences.指示詞 に はコソアドで始まる規則的な体系があります。Concerning the demonstratives, there is a regular system (of words, i guess) that starts by コソアド.指示詞 に は二つの使い方があります。There are two ways of using the demonstratives.On a side note, is it always Xで that is used in combination with 始まる to mean "to start with X"
I don't get why として is used instead of を in this sentence, as it doesn't seem to fit with the "as" sense that I know.品詞と無関係にコソアドとして一括して扱うのが一般的です。What I understand is this:Treating コソアド as a group, regardless of their part of speech, is common.Thinking while writing: I was assuming that として was related to 扱う. But if instead it is related to 一括して then Yとして一括して would mean by grouping them as Y. Which would mean that something like それを would be omitted in the sentence「コソアとドを」コソアドとして一括して扱うのが一般的です。  It is common to treat (コソア and ド) by grouping them together as コソアド.Am I correct
I need to translate the following.安田さんは、結婚してから家内にばかり料理をさせないで、自分も手会うようにしているそうですSo far I have the following.Yasuda-sanafter getting marriedwithout letting anyone but his wife cookhe was trying to ... also meet a hand by himselfI heard.Obviously, I'm not getting that 4th line. And the 3rd line I am not sure about. I know the following.自分 = one's self手 = hand会う = to meetMaybe 手会うis a verb I am unfamiliar with I can't seem to find it online.

This question already has answers here:                                            Do we use odd day pronunciations outside of calendar ranges                                (2 answers)                            Closed 6 years ago.Is 三十四日　read さんじゅうよっか, in analogy with 四日, 十 四日, 二十四日, or is it read さんじゅうよんにち
Is there any reason to use one tense over the other with this verb (and others like it such as 出動, as in軍隊が出動する) Based on the following sample sentences from my Apple dictionary, they seem interchangeable.財務省から研究所に出向させられたHe was seconded from the Ministry of Finance to a research institute.大学から付属病院に出向しているHe is on loan from the university to the university hospital.
I've recently learned that the particle を can be replaced by either particles は/が. However, the stress on the focus of the sentence doesn't make sense to me.My book gives this example:  ご飯を食べました。 (I've eaten DINNER; focus is on the fact that dinner was eaten)  ご飯はたべました。 (I've EATEN dinner; focus is on the fact that it was dinner that was eaten)Shouldn't it be the other way around From what I understand of は/が, the preceding word is set as the topic/focus of the sentence. So concerning the sentence ご飯はたべました。, the focus would be on dinner and not that they had already eaten dinner right
My understanding is that, strictly speaking, "honorific" Japanese 敬語{けいご} is completely different from "formal" Japanese 丁寧語{ていねいご}. Yet, I sometimes hear even native speakers conflate them:ex:「する」の尊敬語{そんけいご} ---&gt;「なさる」「する」の丁寧語 ---&gt;「します」「する」の謙譲語{けんじょうご} ---&gt; 「いたす」「書く{かく}」の尊敬語  ---&gt; 「お書きになる」「書く」の丁寧語 ---&gt;「書きます」「書く」の謙譲語 ---&gt;「お書きいたす」formal (not honorific) escalation:「だ」--&gt;「です」--&gt;「である」--&gt;「であります」honorific (not formal) escalation:「です」 --&gt;「でございまさう」Strictly speaking, am I right about this But, is the reality that the usage of honorifics necessarily means you are speaking formally For years now, I've heard the phrases "honorific Japanese", and "formal Japanese", often used interchangeably. Isn't there a distinct differenceIndeed, I've read a little Mishima, and he writes formally, but not honorifically. So, there must be a clean difference, and it's just that some people carelessly interchange those two phrases, right
I noticed that Unicode has slots for the decomposition type of kanji. I have been wondering why it has only 12 slots (and doesn't even include a slot for "indecomposable", an empty box for a character like 木).I can come up with more decomposition types, e.g. a long box on top and two small boxes on the bottom, for a character like 森.Is it general practice to only distinguish the 12 types listed in Unicode Is 森 analysed as being of something like "primary decomposition type" top (木) and bottom (林)
The second line in the first paragraph of this Bloomberg news article reads as such:「ロシア軍{ぐん}は既{すで}にウクライナのクリミア自治共和国{じちきょうわこく}の一部{いちぶ}の施設{しせつ}を占拠{せんきょ}しており、ウクライナ政府{せいふ}は軍事{ぐんじ}侵攻{しんこう}を受{う}けていると非難{ひなん}している。」　　I perceive that to mean:"Russian military forces already occupy some facilities in Ukraine's Crimean autonomous region, and the Ukrainian government is condemning their having suffered this military invasion.  I've never seen the structure "しておる" (which I assume is the structure from which "しており" is derived. Isn't "おる" 謙譲語{けんじょうご} And, straight news articles surely could not have the context for 敬語{けいご}.  But, even so, the convention in newspapers is to use "しており", instead of "してあり"I just read past "しており" and assign it no meaning. I want to change this. I'd like to have at least some meaning come to mind when I read "しており、".

Improve this question                    I've been reading this article which I can understand fine in general, but it's the last couple of sentences in which the translator gives his own opinion I'm at a loss. The article is about how Lego has been split into specific sets aimed at different genders.http://www.gizmodo.jp/2014/02/1981.htmlただ、訳者の超私見ですが、子供の遊ぶ力って、大人のメッセージ伝達力なんか軽々と圧倒してくれて、本人が興味を持てば「自分はこの商品のターゲットか」とか関係なく遊びたがるんじゃないでしょうか。Except for the first part where the translator states he's going to give us his opinion it just won't come together in my mind. I think the translator says it doesn't really matter what the person with the critique says(she picked out the lego example herself) because the children will play with the things they want to play with.It's probably wrong, but the best I can do right now.
I recently asked for a well done steak at a restaurant, while my friend asked for a medium rare. When waiter came back with two steaks, he used 「火をよく入れた方」 to let us know which one is well done. So essentially it was used as "the one cooked longer".I then tried to re-use this expression at the other restaurant in the same situation, with the only difference that now I was supposed to tell waiter what kind of steak I'm expecting (so that he could give me the right one out of two he brought). And he didn't get what I meant.I later asked my Japanese colleague about this expression and he claimed that it is not a standard thing to use 火を入れる　in such context. However, searching on the Internet gives me following examples, which reassures me that waiter from the first restaurant was not wrong:「肉にはどのように火を入れるのがいいのか？」「それはさておき、サシの多い和牛肉は、ある程度、火を入れた方がおいしいです。」Could it be that this expression when used in context of frying meat is a professional slang of some sort Any advice would be appreciated.
I would like to ask what does "しっくりきます" mean
Help me please with translating this sentence -「ああいう奴らの家庭ほど、家に帰るとぐちゃぐちゃだったりすんのよ」Maybe I’m missing something, but that part just does’t make much sense to me. My interpritation would sound some thing like this – 方２ says that she getting irrated from these guys so much, that when she comes home she is a mess, just like those guys parents which are always with them, so the translation would sound something like this –“To the extent of their family(just like their family), when I comehome I’m a mess.”But I’m having some doubts with this translation, so I would really appreciate your help.方１：「ほんとうのことです。学校でも家でもいつもひとりで、給食の時間とか運動会とか文化祭とか、みんなが楽しそうに盛り上がる時間が大嫌いでした」方２：「わ、あたしと同じだ。あたしもああいうの大っ嫌い」方２：「なんかみんなベタベタして仲良し比べみたいな感じでさ。ああいう奴らの家庭ほど、家に帰るとぐちゃぐちゃだったりすんのよ」
This question is about puns, or dajare, where at the end of a sentence almost every time there's dake ni to be heard. I'm having trouble understanding what role dake ni has in these sentences When translated literally it doesn't make much sense to me. These are all from recent anime I'm watching, for example:One is about shougi (将棋): Sugu komacchau, koma dake niOne pun was: juudou (柔道) is a sport where every person throws at the same angle, which is juu do (十度), juudou dake niThis one was about bicycle club, where when members drive, Okane ga ochite, charin, charin, chari dake niSo what's dake ni doing there Or rather how should it be translated
In English we have a generic and two directional ways of saying related things:return - doesn't imply a direction, has other uses including transitive ones (I returned the book I borrowed)come back - direction is toward speaker but sometimes toward listener, always intransitivego back - direction is away from speaker, toward listener, always intransitiveIn Japanese I know of two verbs but I'm not sure how to use them correctly:返{かえ}る戻{もど}るI'm only interested in intransitive for this question. Here's some examples, possibly not the best ones:I came back to Japan last week.I have to go back to Australia next month.I will return to Japan next year.
I'm trying to understand the phrase 「Ａを心配させるな」 by "sounding it out" in English. I can understand 「Ａを心配かけるな」as meaning "Do NOT associate/connect any worries with Ａ!!!". In my thinking, that makes sense.But, I can't think of how to "sound-out" the phrase 「Ａを心配させるな」 into English. As 「させる」 is causative, the command would seem to have to be directed at the person who is causing someone else to worry: 「田中さん、Ａについて、Bobを心配させるな。」 "Tanaka-san, do not cause Bob to worry about A." And, "Bob" is the one who is worried, and "Tanaka-san" is to whom I am giving a command. Yet, this discussion asserts that 「Ａを心配かける」and 「Ａを心配させる」 have the same basic meaning, at least in some situations.So, how can a speaker of English sound-out "Ａを心配させるな" in EnglishPerhaps:"Do not cause yourself to be worried about A."  OR "Do not allow yourself to be worried about A (by some unspoken factor)." // but this is passive voice, not causative. Most certainly I don't even understand causative/passive to begin with.
二重敬語 is presumably considered bad style (or simply incorrect).I hear/read 拝見いたしました all the time. Is it an example of 二重敬語I understood 二重敬語 to be a little more complex than "used a polite form more than once in a phrase".To be a bit more precise, I think that to express a verb in 敬語, one should make the verb polite, but only once, so thatお読みになるis 敬語, butお読みになられるis 二重敬語.拝見いたす might be fine, because 拝見 is a (敬語) noun and いたす is a (敬語) verb; or it might be a problem, because 拝見する is a (敬語) form of 見る.

Imagine wanting to tell a superior something along the lines of, "I saw/read/received your e-mail."  In Japanese, there's sometimes something with using the te form along with words like くださる and もらう to suggest a favor has been done, or something like that.  So would this be a good way to put it:電子メールを見てくださいました。As in, "I saw your nice e-mail," or something like that.Why or why not  If not, what's the proper way to go about this  Thanks!

In what situations is 魚 pronounced as 「うお」 vs. 「さかな」  I personally like 「うお」 better, but I don't know why.  Is it reserved for only certain scenarios
They both mean "ship/boat".  Are they completely interchangeable  Do they signify boats of different sizes or uses (people, cargo, etc.)  Is only 船 used in compounds to describe metaphorical "boats" of abstract usage, like [風船]{ふう・せん}
I usually hear 個 referred to as a general purpose counter (which is how it is used in Chinese) similar to hitotsu, futatsu, etc... I just read a source which claims that it tends to refer to 3-dimensional objects and contrasts with 本 in this way:ni-hon no nasu = two (long) eggplantsni-ko no nasu = two (round) eggplantsIs this correct or would "ni-ko no nasu" be better left as "two (unspecified) eggplants"
I've just noticed that the usual word for "peanut" or "peanuts" in Japanese is "ピーナッツ" (pīnattsu), but the first spelling I found, from looking in the translation table in the English Wiktionary was actually "ピーナツ" (pīnatsu).It turns out the first one has its own entry while the second one is just a redlink in the English entry's translation table. But both seem to get plenty of Google hits.Are they both correct Might they have slightly different usages, such as in combining forms or singular vs pluralSince I'm asking, there is also 落花生{らっかせい}. Is it no longer used in favour of the English-derived term

Improve this question                    I have found an old Japanese note that I would very much like to translate. Background info: I found it in an old gaming console where you're supposed to scan barcodes (barcode is at the back of the note) and it most probably has to do with that.However, it's handwritten (and my Japanese is extremely rusty), therefore just recognizing the characters (especially the kanji) is very hard for me. I have attached the photo of the note, and I am trying to transcribe it line by line. So far I have (and might still be very wrong):小 _ 生のじいちゃん (I believe じいちゃん means 'grandfather')( _ のう _ _ のみ木丑 _ の _ _ _ そ _ 土じろ )_ いババ(not even trying this one yet)I was wondering if there are any tips on recognizing handwritten Japanese Or if anyone could help me translate this
Sorry for the trivial question, but I've just started learning Japanese and thought that I should know how to write my name in hiragana. My name is Harriet.My first guesses were はリえた or はリえと. I tried putting it into some web applications: one gave me はありと (which seems like a strange way of doing it), and another gave me some kanji and the romaji 'Harietto' which I guess would be はりえっと ()What would be the correct way of writing the name 'Harriet'
If you have the name of a shop plus さん, what possibilities are there for the translation I get the sense that it can either be a formal way to speak, or it can mean the store person. 薬屋 = pharmacy薬屋さん= pharmacy (polite) OR pharmacistIs this correct Or does the さん just mean one of the two
For years I have been saying "またまた" for "see you" to Japanese people I meet. Well at least half the time, since I also often say "またね".But only tonight for the first time did anybody pick me up on it and tell me it's not right! I arrived yesterday in Okinawa for the first time.So I know a more "proper" way to say it is "じゃあまた" and considered "またね" as a bit more informal. I had always thought I picked up "またまた" from a backpacker I met either at home in Australia or in a hostel in some third country. Possibly even from staff in a hostel in Japan.So is it something I just imagined or made up myself Or is it actually used as slang by young people in some part of Japan
Sometimes I am offered something but because I'm just a beginner I don't know what verb they used.I know the proper way to say "no" is to answer with the negative form of the verb the other person used, that いいえ alone is too abrupt.Also from experience I know that the words in some languages meaning "want" or "need" might have nuances that make them inappropriate.Usually I want to say "I don't need it" or "I don't want one" in a shop that offers me a bag or a drinking straw or disposable chopsticks. But this evening while exploring Naha I discovered I had wandered into the red light district and was offered a "nice girl"!How should I correctly express "no thanks, I don't want one" when I didn't hear the verb used

ちょっと君に話しがあるI saw this sentence in my downloaded deck of cards. Does it make sense.Why does it feel like "You have a little bit of a story in you". How do you interpret this What does the に In other words, is it a target particle for the ある or 話. The way I see it it should be broken up as"君に話" 　＋　"がある"not君に話がある
One of the first things people learn in Japanese class is the old 私はケーキを食べます。Once you begin to get more experienced with Japanese you soon learn that the initial watashi wa is not good form and is always dropped. Fair enough.But I am now living in Japan, getting rather solidly into intermediate Japanese and encountering more and more ‘real’ Japanese. It seems to me that examples like I eat cake just aren’t said very often and as a result を is sparsely used.When I come to write I seem to have lots of がs and とs, a few はs, and the occasional に, but を and へ seem to not be needed so often.Am I just a little crazy here or is my observation right Is を truly a sparsely used particle In most common examples where the newbie may think to use を I increasingly see と (reported speech and the like. を is of course wrong) and に (I guess people like the vagueness of going towards something and not actually 100% doing it).
So I have been wondering from this video: http://www.youtube.com/watchv=XiWiYjW1XrcHow would one write the Katakana for this name that has an exclamation mark And how would we pronounce it Thanks!

I saw an advertisement on the train that said 世界に友達を作りたい... My Japanese friend said that the difference with "世界で友達を作りたい" is that で means like "In the world" whilst に means "all over the world".I get that に is sort of like a means of highlighting the way, direction, actors and all that sort of indirect information of an action, and not necessarily "to" as beginners are taught.  So does that mean more like "the world" is the place of the action, but the action is moving throughout it and not restricted to on definite point like で would beSUMMARY:What is the nuance of the particle に here and are there any other examples of such usage of に I've heard Xにあふれる which is sort of like it I feel.
Today I found this sentence on my Japanese textbook (みんなの日本語中級I - 本冊 pg. 70) And it didn't make any sense to me.前から２両目の電車を降りたところで待っています。I looked for 両目 on 電子辞書 and it says it means both eyes. Still didn't make any sense to me so I put it in Google Translator and the result was... well the expected one:We are waiting in the place where I got off the train two eyes from the front.Does this have any special meaning (I mean the use of 両目) or is it just that there is a mistake on the textbook and it should just be:前から２目の電車を降りたところで待っています。Which means the 2nd train.

My textbook includes numerous examples of 次第, such as following nouns in which it can be translated as "depending on", or when following the 連用形 of verbs in which it can be translated as "as soon as", but it includes another set of examples in which it follows the 連体形 of verbs and is followed by the copula です.The following is one such example:日時の変更について、改めてお知らせする次第です。(I will inform you later of any changes in the time and place of the meeting.)The only explanation that the book gives for this kind of usage is to gloss the sentence with "知らせるわけです".Looking at these such examples, it seems to me that this type of 次第です may be a type of polite language. Is this correct What are the nuances of its usage

According to my information, this postcard was sent from Japan to Russia, and probably in 1945.Needs a translation badly and nobody has seemed to care since then. I suppose that the historical kana usage can take place here.P.S.: Yes, a translation request, but definitely not the usual case, somewhat intricate, otherwise I would be able to translate it myself. Yet feel free to close it if you think that it just does not fit.
I love in Japanese, how adjectival clauses are just added in front of nouns like adjectives.The pizza that I ate = 私が食べたピザBut last night I became confused... In english we have words to link the clause to the main sentence (my grammar knowledge and terminology is pathetic, I know).a) The ball that I kickedb) The pen with which I wrotec) The building that I enteredd) The garden in which I playedLets first look at a different form of thoseA) I kicked the ball私はボールを蹴ったB) I wrote with the pen私はペンで書いたC) I entered the building私はビルに入ったD) I played in the garden私は庭で遊んだIn the Japanese we use different particles に、を、で to describe what part each word plays in the sentence.  Just like the english (with, in).When we change the english to the first form (a,b,c,d).  We use (with which, in which, that).  But from what I've seen, in the Japanese form the pattern is indistinguishable between a,b,c,da) The ball that I kicked私が蹴ったボールb) The pen with which I wrote私が書いたペンc) The building that I entered私が入ったビルd) The garden in which I played私が遊んだ庭Is that correct  It seems to lose any idea of what part the noun played in the action - it's ambiguous.  To me (b) reads: "The pen I wrote". But maybe it could be read as "The pen I wrote on" or "The pen I wrote with".Am I doing it right  Or am I missing something.  It may be that the part a noun plays in the action is never ambiguous, but I'm not sure if that's true.
I have the following translation for class.勉強しなかった悪い学生に、家で漢字を三百回書かせて、それを持って来させて、それから、教室の前に一時間立たせた。So far I have the following.Bad students who didn't studyI made them write kanji 300 times at home and.... andafter that, I made them stand at the front of the classroom for an hour. That 3rd line I am really having problems with. I see the "to make someone" structure with the 来させて. And then the て form of "to have" with the 持って. So "I made them to have this and come" Or I think て and 来る　can mean to come to a point. So maybe "so as to make them get to have this" like in an "understand this" sort of way  I just don't know...
I have the following sentence to translate for class. 頭と歯と指と耳と足が痛くて、      苦しくて、      気持ちが悪かったので、      九時半すぎに      薬局に行かせた。So far I have the following.

I noticed カラオケ (karaoke) is always written in katakana on signs/buildings in Japan, despite it being a Japanese word. Why is it not written in Kanji or HiraganaAs I understand it, the usual reasons for using katakana are things like:words with a Western origin,to emphasise a foreign/unusual accent/voice or onomatopoeia (especially in manga), orfor traditional emphasis on words that pre-date Kanji.But カラオケ is a modern Japanese word (which has been borrowed by English from Japanese, rather than the other way around), so I don't understand why it would be written exclusively in katakana
I was brushing up on some basic vocabulary. Asked what the Japanese equivalent of "the means (of doing something)", I would use 方法. However, they've used 手段. As far as I can tell, these are (fairly) synonymous. Is there a difference Are there places/phrases where you would use one but not the other
There is some discussion about "体言止め{たいげんどめ}" on the internet, but it is all in Japanese. My Japanese ability is too low to be able to read it, so I need some help.  At the least, "体言止め" refers to ending a sentence with a サ変名詞{へんめいし} and omitting the "をする". "体言止め" is more than just this, but I'm not sure what.  "体言止め" translates to "ending a sentence with a noun or a noun phrase." But, I hope a little more context could be provided.
I have recently started reading novels as a means to improve my Japanese after reaching a comfortable enough level to do so. I am familiar with the use of the non-past form (dictionary form) in Japanese narration to convey a sense of the present (the action occurs at the time of utterance) in which case it feels closer to the English use of the past tense than the present progressive, in the sense that the action is complete.My question is about the interpretation of when these verbs appear before nouns (attributive verbs). More specifically when the verb is an action rather than a state or emotion, for example :俺の肩を掴む手をそっとはずす.差し込む日差しは春のように柔らかで...倒れている俺と剣を構える兵士の間に...泣きじゃくる少女の背中を優しくさする.Now from the context as I remember it, all of these should have been ongoing actions (or states resulting from an action) rather than actions that occurred at the time of utterance (I say that because I remember clearly the action starting a couple of lines earlier in most of these cases), so it should have been something like掴んでいる手...  剣を構えている兵士... 泣きじゃくっている少女... etcAnother way of interpreting them (especially if they come up in a conversation rather than narration) is as habits, which is clearly not the case here.Can you please tell me how I should subtly understand this pattern I am reasoning based on a conclusion I reached that apart from verbs expressing states or internal emotions the dictionary form never expresses something that's ongoing right now.Thanks in advance!
Original videoI am trying to decipher:知らない方がいいって事もあるんですThe translation that is provided with this phrase is "Some things are better off left unknown." I'm trying to break this down but I'm stuck.I know that 知らない方がいい means "it is better to not know" and 〜事があるんです can describe having the experience of doing something. What I don't understand is this って construction in the middle—can anyone explain how this affects the meaning of the sentence (Did I transcribe it properly)

A sentence from 五輪書:おのづから道の器用有りて、天理をはなれざる故か。I found a question about ～ざる and ～ぬ on 知恵袋. The only answer claims that ～ぬ and ～ざる are both the 連体形 of ～ず and ～ざる is a "complementary" conjugation, to be used when the 連体形 is to modify a 助動詞.Here はなれざる modifies 故{ゆえ}, which is a noun. From the answer on 知恵袋, it seems that ～ざる is complementary, to be used when ぬ doesn't work, but here はなれぬ故 does work. Why did the author choose ～ざる Does one have a free choice between ～ぬ and ～ざる Is the choice characteristic of a particular time period

I'm studying the kanji on the Heisig's book "Remembering the Kanji" and yesterday I came across the number 56: 員 which is translated in the book as "employee". I also have a subscription on JapanesePod101 and the today world of day was: 従業員 which turned out to mean... "employee". I'm actually quite confused. After a search on wwwjdic I found out that 員 means "member" so why Heisig translates it as "employee"
To make articles as short as possible in newspapers, certain conventions are used. One such convention is that when a sentence ends with サ変名詞{へんめいし}、「をする」is omitted. Another is that the full names of companies, such as "三菱重工業株式会社" can be abbreviated as "三菱重工".I could be wrong, but I am pretty sure that abbreviated writing style has a formal name. What is itWhat are some other conventions
I'm translating an excerpt for fun, but this section struck me as odd:彼女は、口に持っていきかけていたコップを、ゆっくりとテーブルに戻すと、それっきり、放心したように、黙り込んでしまう。微速度撮影でうつした、枯れていく花のように、みるみる両眼が落ちくぼみ、鼻がそげ、あれほどなめらかだった肌の色も、揉み皮のように張りを失い、唇のあいだには、桑の実を食べた後のような、黒いおりがにじみ出る。This is how I translated that section:In mid-motion, she stopped and slowly lowered to the table the cup she had raised to her lips. And after that, as though her soul had left her, she went mute. As I watched, like a flower in time-lapse, her eyes sank inward, her nose drooped, and the color of her skin that had been so smooth, lost its tension like chamois leather. Around her lips, a dark stain appeared like that left by mulberries.My problem is, the idea of "color" losing tension or pluck (candidate translations of 張り) feels nonsensical in English. One hypothesis is that も is actually attached to 肌, not 色.What do you think

In English, we can refer to an old person using "elderly", or "aged person".

Quick question regarding the -te form of the verb もっていく (to take). From my understanding the verb is a combination between もって+ いく(to go) and as such conjugates its -te form as もっていって is this correctThe reason I'm asking is because I've seen it conjugated online a few times as もっていいて which would indicate that the -te form would be conjugating as if it were a regular -く ending verb, as opposed to conjugating as いく (to go) does (いって）.If someone could clarify it's conjugation I'd be super appreciative.Thanks!Matt
In the chapter Things that should be a certain way of Tae Kim's guide, the author states that in order to express the expectation of something not happening, one should use something like 「～はずがない」.

Several years back, I learned from a free Japanese podcast that referring to something with 'sonnano' or 'annano'  is a way of looking down on it / speaking of it as an undesirable thing.  There have been times when I've heard these terms used in sentences that sounded like the speaker was talking about something they found distasteful, but other times when it seemed the speaker had no real personal opinion on the subject.  Are these terms used to speak of undesirable things every time they are usedAre there other phrases similar that are used for the same purposeThanks so much in advance for your time and help with my question!  *^_^*

What is the particle と means in ためにと用意した, and how is it different from ために用意した初撃{しょげき}の後{あと}の陽動{ようどう}のためにと用意{ようい}した慧{けい}による「姫{ひめ}」の誘拐作戦{ゆうかいさくせん}。"The strategy of kidnapping the "princess" by/which is done with the help of Kei, is prepared in order to make a diversion after the first attack."Thank you!Context:慧「まったく・・・そのやたら無謀なところは昔とまったく変わらないな、お前は・・・」雪隆「それで、どうする？　協力してくれるか？」慧「…それは」俺の問いに慧は…。初撃の後の陽動のためにと用意した慧による『姫』の誘拐作戦。最初から第９の騎士に奪還させることが目的ではあったのだが、るる姉たちは何も知らずによくやってくれた。おかげで『姫』は争奪戦無しで転がり込み、俺は闘技場に残った筆頭騎士三人を葬る事が出来た。More context: As far as I understand the kidnapping of 姫 itself was 初撃の後の陽動のために, because before the kidnapping the speaker/narrator with 慧's help made a sneak attack and in order to not fall under suspicion, right after the attack 慧 kidnaped 姫, and while the sneak attack and the kidnapping 慧 was disguised, so nobody except narrator knew who is it

In English, we call footage that plays after the credits of a movie a "stinger".

Foreign professional qualifications that are well known have accepted translations. For example:US Certified Public Accountant, CPA, is 米国公認会計士、which is close to the Japanese equivalent. Chartered Accountant (the equivalent of a CPA in the UK, Canada and other Commonwealth countries) is  著許会計士. The kanji chosen here refer to the Royal charters under which the various CA qualifications were created. As for "private" qualifications (ie those not recognised in law)that have "Certified" in their original English names: Some use 公認 (eg Certified Financial Analyst (CFA) =公認財務アナリスト), Others do not (eg Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE) = 不正検査士)I am asking because there are some newer "private" qualifications that are known but have not yet been passed by many Japanese and based on my research do not have a commonly accepted Japenese translation:Can one use 公認 to be consistent with the English name(One example of these would be the "Certified Financial Risk Manager" set by an organisation called GARP (http://www.garp.org/frm/frm-program.aspxgclid=CLe78tKBx7wCFVDLtAodiGsAVQ), one could just say ファイナンシャル・リスク・マネジャー, to be consistent with the initials (FRM), but  公認 would be more consistent with the English name.)
So, I was playing the Japanese version of Akinator (cf. English version), which basically entails playing a sort of 20 Questions-like game - the basic idea is that you pick a real or fictional person/character, and then the genie asks you questions about the person you've picked so as to figure out who the person you've picked is. One of the questions asked about my character was this one:タイプを分けるとパッション？I guess that タイプ is English "type" as in "variety"; 分ける is "to separate / divide / partition"; and パッション is English "passion" (not sure what sense). I have no idea how this fits together to form a coherent sentence, though. What does this question meanIt strikes me as possible that this might be the result of machine translation from one of the other languages in which Akinator is available - some of the other questions I've seen appear to be of dubious grammaticality, too.

The complete sentence is this:ハンジは仲間を喰ったその巨人の腹をかっさいたI can't really understand the meaning, why is it ハンジは istead of ハンジの？Then we have 腹をかっさいた.腹 means stomach while かっさい means to cheer, to make an ovationThanks for your help.
I recognize that it's another way of saying "good night," where does it come from
I have been researching many various sites regarding advice for how to properly write lyrics in Japanese. Some say that you just write what you want;  not even syllabic structure is needed.On the other hand, I've seen documentation speaking meticulously on the specific ways Japanese lyrics should be written.  It even goes in to a more mathematical, calculating way to view how to write words for Japanese songs.I wonder if the latter is old-fashioned/customary method compared to a more modern, contemporary method.Any help, opinion or further advice on this matter would be very appreciated.
While at first I believed it was simply bound to each individual word, I've noticed that the same onomatopoeic word sometimes has と after it and sometimes it doesn't.Here's a case I stumbled upon:踊り手は つま先立ってぐるぐると回った犬が自分のしっぽを追いかけてぐるぐる回っているWhat difference does the inclusion of と make
I understand the meaning of this phrase, but I have a hard time understanding how it's constructed.In phrases like それで or というわけで you have a noun plus the particle で. This looks superficially similar, except that それが元(です) is a sentence, not a noun (or noun phrase).What's going on here Is there a bunch of other stuff being left unspoken
I'm having a little trouble parsing the usage of 「という」 when it it has meanings other than to call, to be called or to say.I often see sentences like 「いざという時, ということだ」　and 「これという問題はない」. The dictionary I use gives the definition: とりたてて言う意を表す。 But I'm still quite unsure about it. If someone could explain how that definition fits into those uses then I'd be grateful.
I've noticed a few words like these:恥ずかしがり屋{や}  寂しがり屋  怖がり屋  I've only noticed this with a few adjectives, like the ones above, and with verbs with たい:目立ちたがり屋I suppose this ending is just a combination of がる and 屋.  I thought that perhaps がり屋 might be considered a special combination, but I couldn't find it in any dictionaries.  I did find this definition for 屋 in 明鏡国語辞典, which I think is the relevant one:それを専門とする人や、そのような性質の人である意を表す。We already have a question asking whether 〜がる is limited to specific adjectives.  So I guess the question I want to ask is this: can I use がり屋 for any word where I can use がる  Or is it strange outside of those few words where it seems to be commonly used, like 恥ずかしがり屋
This appears to be some kind of adult slang term, or maybe it's internet slang, whatever the case may be I can't find a definition in any dictionary. Is it an onomatopoeia
The BOJ seems to like this word and it is translated as either "epoch-making" or "groundbreaking"Original Japanese sentence:この点、日本銀行は、1月の金融政策決定会合において、自らの判断で「物価安定の目標」を消費者物価の前年比上昇率2％と定め、これをできるだけ早期に実現するという画期的な約束をしました。Official translation:At the Monetary Policy Meeting held in January, the Bank -- on its own judgment -- set the price stability target at 2 percent in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) and made a groundbreaking commitment to achieve that target at the earliest possible time. In other places the BOJ has translated this as "epoch-making." But epoch-making events to a native English speaker would mean like ... the fall of Rome rather than a small change in the policy of a central bank.I get the basic etymology of what's going on with the Japanese but I have a two-part question arising from this:(1) Does this word's meaning really rise to the level of creating a new epoch in Japan(2) What more natural equivalent can you think of for the EnglishExamples always help!
Let's say I'm a very young child and I love dessert. After my family goes out today, my dad is going to buy us ice cream; he needs to tell my mom in front of me, without me finding out. In English, he might spell it out like:After ..., we'll go get some I-C-E C-R-E-A-M. (Eye see ee, see are ee eh emm.)Since very young kids can't usually spell well enough to make out a message like this, it's encrypted to them but not to mom, who needs the information.However, in Japanese, I feel like saying each kana of アイスクリーム would be equally obvious to the child as saying the word since, to my knowledge, kana do not have an alternative pronunciation to the sound they make.How do parents obscure a Japanese word so that a very young child will not understand it
My dictionary says this word means something like "official; public" - how does the word go from that definition to being used as a derogatory suffix for animals and people One example the dictionary gives is 熊公 how would this be any different than 熊め to express anger towards a bear I should also add that the word can also indicate intimacy and a high level of respect.
This is a prayer uttered by someone who I presume is imitating archaic speech:遍く邪悪より御身を守らんWhat is the conjugation used in 守らん It's doesn't seem like a negative which was my first thought.
Okay, according to the (monolingual) dictionary that I use, てやる is used to indicate "doing something with strong will or determination" (my translation) e.g. 飛び降りてやる! But this definition seems a little too vague for me; is there anything that it actually translates to in EnglishI've seen some sources claim that it still means "do" but I'm unsure, because I have come across constructs like やってやる！
I have posted a "status" on Facebook:Dear santa, I would like for you to bring him for christmasMy boyfriend commented:Your Wish is my command!And my Japanese manager (from our office) commented:ごちそうさま!!In this case, what does ごちそうさま!! mean  I think it is definitely not the meaning "Thanks for the meal".So, are there any other meanings of ごちそうさま!!？
I have the following translation for class. 今年も、  トゥーソンは、  雨が少なく、  水が不足して、  困るかもしれません。So far, I have the following.This year also  Tucson  rain is little  water has become insufficient and  it might be a problem.I have a few questions.Why is there that も on 今年 Is it just signifying that the absence of rain is "also" like other yearsI am confused by the 雨が少なく. I am not sure how to relate it to Tucson. "As for Tucson, the rain is little" Also, I would expect a て at the end (少なくて). But is it somehow an adverb instead of て form
The other day I came across this line in a game:しかしそれ以外は誰とも出会わず、そして 歩けど歩けど 代わり映えしない通路と部屋ばかり。I guessed that 歩けど meant 歩いても from the context, but I had never seen a verb conjugated like that before. Is it something from a dialect, or perhaps classical Japanese
In France they have "Les Trente Glorieuses" and in Germany the "Wirtschaftswunder". What is the analog in JapaneseEdit to elaborate: In the case of France there is a very specific term -- "The Glorious Thirty Years", so there is no question of which period in history we are referring to.What I am looking for is a similarly specific term in Japanese--provided of course that such a specific term exists. Perhaps just like with Germany ("economic miracle") there is no such  specific term.The current answer given now is 高度経済成長期, which translates roughly to "period of high economic growth". Is there perhaps a more specific term than that Edit #2: In the Wikipedia and Kotobank links, there is also some mention of the post WWI boom, the boom through 1944, and the Meiji Restoration. So might there perhaps be some ambiguity as to what 高度経済成長期 refers to Or is it unambiguousIn contrast, there is, presumably, no other period of thirty years in French history which is commonly regarded as "glorious", so there is no ambiguity here. We know you're referring to the postwar era when you talk about "Les Trente Glorieuses". Similarly, even though the term "economic miracle" is not very specific, I believe in Germany when you talk about "Wirtschaftswunder", people generally take it to refer to the postwar period.
Can anybody explain why かい is used in the following sentence from 第三夜 (Dream #3 - from Natsume Sōseki's Ten Nights of Dreams, 夢十夜):自分が御前の眼はいつ潰れたのかいと聞くと、何昔からさと答えた。"I asked [him] when [he] had gone blind to which [his] casual reply was "Oh, ages back".According to the Dictionary of Basic Japanese Grammar and the answer to a previous question, linked below, かい is for yes/no questions, だい is for WH-questions.In what situation can I use ~かい (for interrogative question)
つーか怖いしあとレアI don't understand how あと is used in this sentence. What does it meanレア should mean rare, rightThank you for your help.
In English, I often say "I'm just curious, but...". The best phrase I've come up with for this in Japanese is 「[好奇心]{こうきしん}だけですが・・・」but I've never heard a native speaker use this. I recently saw 「なぜなのか気になりますが・・・」, but that sounds strange to me as well.  Is this just something that isn't said, or is there a totally regular phrasing for this that I just haven't yet found
The text I'm asking about comes from a brochure selling pens with bodies of traditional decorated Imari porcelain. Here's the pen design, with its name:黄緑彩兜唐草From another brochure, I gather that the reading is: おうりょくさいかぶとからくさ.I understand that 黄緑彩（おうりょくさい） describes the yellow-green color, and 唐草（からくさ） describes the arabesque pattern. But what's the 兜（かぶと） doing in thereI have a theory that it might refer to a plant called 鳥兜（トリカブト）, but I can't confirm it.
Assume I want to say something like :I called you to go out.How a sentence with the same structure would be translated Is there like a certain pattern or rule to it
Is there a difference between these two words for "tomorrow" and when each is used (and is it just coincidence that あした sounds like the past tense of あす)We tend to be taught あした and then discover あす when we listen to the programs like the weather forecast. I've never seen an explanation. My dictionary cross references them to each other.
All the methods I know failed. My count is 7 strokes, but may be wrong. I think the key is the bottom part, but no radical matches its shape.The rest of the word, including particle, is: きながらでもThe full sentence is: パンなんか []きながらでも 食{た}べられるでしょー！I tried to stroke the kanji here http://kanji.sljfaq.org/draw.html with no success.
I want to say :It is okay to have fun at new year's eve ,however think about others.The only part that I was able to translate is :おしょうがつにたのしみますだいじょうぶでも.....and I can't complete.The situation is that people at new year's eve throw their old stuff,beer bottles,garbage,etc.. in the streets. The next day it becomes very hard for the street cleaners to clean that mess so it is kind of sad. I want to write that it is okay to have fun at that day however be considerate to others.
Prior to the development of the な particle (presumably from なる) several hundred years ago, what constructions were used where な-construtions are currently used E.g. in the phase きれいな女, would that have been きれいの女, 女のきれい, きれい女 (and would that be kireionna or kirei onna), きれいなる女　or something else
Something like今育児休業(いくじきゅうぎょう)です。
I'm having trouble translating this sentence from a manga. A guy who's already dead is talking to another.He says:私を殺したあの時とAnd then the next page, it's only this speech bubble:何一つI would have translated it as "You said you'd kill me that day" - "but you haven't killed anything at all" (from the context of the story).But could the first sentence not also mean "When you killed me that day" I don't really understand the meaning of と at the end. Is it for quotation or as when/if-indication (then と would be in the middle of the sentence). Thank you for your help!
I can't understand the meaning of this sentence very well:聞いてもねえ事をペラペラと喋る。。。I know that 事をペラペラと喋る means to talk glibly about something, 聞いて comes from 聞く to listen, but I don't get the general meaning.Thank you for your help.
I understand the basics of the "suffering passive". For example, it's my understanding that in a sentence like 友達にビールを飲まれた, "tomodachi ni" marks the person who drank your beer.ぼくにもんくいわれても困るWho does ぼく refer to and what is the role of ぼくに in this sentence
私は東京の田中です。私は東京から田中です。I am want to say Hello, I'm Tanaka and I'm from Tokyo, but I am not sure which is correct. I feel like 2 is the right choice but am not sure.So which is correct and why
I've often seen 真理,真相 and 真実 in contexts that to me seem interchangeable.Could some one give examples of where each word is most appropriateWhen is one more appropriate than the otherFor instance, which is best suited to saying:The truth is above all else
The word 勝ち目 means "odds / chance of success". It is made up of two nouns 勝ち and 目.勝ち obviously means "winning / victory". But what does the kanji 目 meanDoes 勝ち目 mean something along the lines of "your observation (eye) for success" E.g. "勝ち目はないよ" meaning "you have no observation for success"
みんなの日本語 中級I - Lesson 3 says that V (dictionary form) ことにする is used to express the decision to do something. If I say私は日本へ行くことにしました。this can be translated as “I decided to go to Japan”. This is perfectly clear to me. However, what is the correct translation for私は日本へ行くことにします。 Is it “I will decide to go to Japan”, “I decide to go to Japan”, or “I decided to go to Japan” Can you explain to me when to use する in non-past tense
So I know that jiko shoukai is self-introduction. And benkyou is study. So I took a guess and figured that self-study is jiko benkyou. The context of this is if someone asks "how did/do you study Japanese" And the reply is "I studied by myself." or just "Self-study.". So just to make sure I took a quick look at Google Translate and it gave me these options:jishuu dokugaku dokushuuBut didn't give jiko benkyou. So what would be the proper word to use for this response
One of the on'yomi readings of 相 is しょう.  If I'm doing my legwork right, when it's read this way, it has an indication of government involvement, in words like (and here, I'm relying on my dictionaries—I have no idea if these words are commonly used)丞相　じょうしょう　"emperor's assistant"首相　しゅしょう　"prime minister" ← I thought the word for this was 総理大臣　そうりだいじん？Apart from my prime minister question above, I'm struggling to understand what is really meant by "government minister".  Is this a government minister of old (China, even)  Is this contemporarily used for ministers in the government  What level of minister are we talking about  Any old minister, or is it for special ones
Apparently there is a Japanese word forMoving forward taking the good things with you but leaving the bad things behind.Would any of you know what it is
Do IMEs offer gibberish non-words when they make suggestionsI know that there's many words that have the same pronunciation, and therefore users of IMEs have to choose the correct one. I think 感じ (feeling) versus 漢字 (kanji) would be an example of that.I'm also aware of different kanji for related, but different concepts, that have the same pronunciation and are presumably true cognates. I think  お祖父さん (grandfather) and お爺さん (elderly man) would be an example of this.But do IMEs offer words that are nonsensical gibberish in Japanese For example, if I type in "げいこ" into Google Translate's IME, the second option I get is "芸姑", which isn't found in goo.ne.jp nor jisho.org. Is it a real word, or a word that only makes sense in a language other than Japanese, or gibberish I once came across someone typing 芸鼓, which similarly seems to be a doubtful word.
I have a question about その手 part in this text. As far as I can guess 真琴 is talking about her own hand, but in this case shouldn't it be with この, "my hand". The only thought I have is that 真琴's hand, after becoming a doll like, already doesn't belong to "humans domain", but to the "dolls domain". In other words it belongs to someone she's talking with, who gave her this power or somethng.  In any case if my guess is incorrect, I would eally appreciate if you give me correct explanation.暗い部屋の中、ひとりメールを打ち続ける。光奈へのメールを打ち続ける。携帯の画面に、涙が滴る。真琴：「……やだよ……もう、こんなの…」膝を抱え、顔を埋める。クスクスと耳の奥で笑い声がする。真琴：「誰……？」:「わたしは、あなた…だいじょうぶ、わたしを受け入れて…」すうっと頭の中の淀みが消えていく。真琴：「なに、これ…？」その手は、人形の球体関節に変わっている。：「だいじょうぶ、これはあなたと彼女の絆…」真琴：「光奈とあたしの…」:「あなたに、力をあげる。あの子を護れる力を…」真琴：「光奈を護れる、力…」人形となった自分の手を握り締める。真琴：「へえ、だったら、うれしいな…」光奈を護れる。あたしの力で、光奈を護れる。あのひとでもない。あの子たちでもない。あたしの力で、光奈を護れる。光奈：「うう、さむ・・・・・・！」    光奈？　光奈？　光奈？　こっちを見て。     光奈：「あれ、真琴、リカとカナは？」    やった。通じた・・・・・・
I'm aware this is more of a StackOverflow question. If any of you are computer programmers who speak Japanese: how does hexadecimal work I mean the system of numbers which is counted 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F. Do you use Roman letters and Arabic numbers Is it all in kanji
I always place verbs with the "~たがる" ending (called a helping verb) in the present continuous, or past continuous state:行きたがっている。食べたがっていた。  I am having trouble with using the non-continuous tenses (行きたがる、食べたがった) to express myself. The meaning of "~たがる", as I understand it, lends itself too much to being in a continuous state of "wanting to do something" or "having wanted to do something".  I kind of see my strategy as always using the continuous tenses to express myself. And, if I ever hear the non-continuous tenses, then I can understand (but, I cannot remember ever hearing the usage of a non-continuous tense).  Examples of when "~たがる" cannot be used in a continuous tense (the "~たがっている" and "~たがっていた" continuous tenses) would be very helpful to me.
The onyomi of 江 is コウ. Can someone give me a real-life example of when this is read this way  It seems that most of the time its pronounced え...  I should also clarify, yes, I can look this up in a dictionary, but sometimes dictionaries give you words that are obscure/rarely used by most people-- true in any language, right
You can use this construct with verbs:食べれば食べるほど太るand with adjectives:ジェットコースターは高ければ高いほど楽しいbut what about adverbsif, for example, I wanted to say of a windmill "the faster it turns, the more power it generates"
This is the first line of 夏目漱石's story 第一夜, The first night. The story then goes on to describe the narrator's dream.It is translated as "I had dream" but I am struggling to align the normal meaning of こんな (This kind of...) to the story.

I was reading the lyrics of a song called 春先小紅　by 矢野顕子　There is this line that says:きょうはなんだかキレイですI was wondering why キレイ　above is written in Katakana and not in Hiragana Isn't katakana used for foreign words
I'm wondering if there is a real type of dyslexia in Japanese with [濁音]{だく・おん}, where the person sees the word written, but mentally pronounces the 濁音 for a different mora.Not to diagnose myself with anything, but I find myself doing it all the time.  For example, I might read the word [舞台]{ぶ・たい}（ぶたい） and pronounce it in my head as ふだい.  Or I may read かばん and pronounce it as がはん.Is there a term for this specific type of disorder, or would it probably just be classified within general dyslexia  I would like to research this more if possible.(Note: I inquired about the on-/off-topicness of this question on this meta post, and though it received little attention, I believe it to be on-topic based on the responses there and the scope of the question.  Remember, I'm looking for the specific language term, not psychological reasons about how it's caused, etc.  That reasoning should hopefully keep it on-topic)EDITNote 2:  This only happens to me with kanji when there is furigana accompanying it.  That is to say, if I just see 舞台 written as is, I read it correctly.  But if I see it with furigana like [舞台]{ぶたい}, I'm more likely to mess it up.
Can someone explain how 'e' and 'wa' are related in some words / 音便  Presumably the 'e' was originally the obsolete ゑ since it's in the ワ行.Some examples:上（うえ）　←→　上着（うわ・ぎ）声（こえ）　←→　声色（こわ・いろ）終える　←→　終わる(Bonus question:  How do you type ゑ in the IME  I had to copy it from somewhere else.)
In Liza Dalby's book "Geisha", while talking about onsen geisha, she mentions various pejorative terms from the general public. She mentions "korobi" (roll-over, presumably 転び) geisha, and "Daruma" (a doll that tumbles down, presumably だるま) geisha, both of which I understand the imagery of.But how does the term "shomben geisha" (小便芸者, I assume) work Dalby translates it as "toilet geisha", and jisho.org describes 小便 as a colloquial word for urine. I understand that it's a derogatory term, with the same ultimate meaning as the other two terms, but not the imagery involved. Is it because of the male anatomy used with 小便(By the way, Dalby also notes that skilled artists exist in the onsen towns, sentiments that I'd echo)
...where the furigana is a different "word"/"synonym" for the actual kanji in song lyrics, titles, etc.A couple references to this:Why are some lyrics' words written in kanji whose usual reading is not how it is sungサモンナイト ツインエイジ 〜精霊たちの[共鳴]{«こえ»}〜Is there any distinct name for this technique
I have seen a lot of kanjis with two dots on the top as in 前、咲く、呼ぶ、etc. What is that radical In http://jisho.org/kanji/radicals/, I see they have mentioned this two dot radical in their list, but when I look it up in any proper Kangxi radical chart, I see no such radical. Is it a combination of two ´「てん」 If it is, how do such dots make any meaning Another similar example in this regard would be the "diagonal sweeping stroke" in kanjis like 呼ぶ and 町. How to arrive at meanings with such radicals
On jisho.org, 使い is translated with words such as "errand", and the same holds true on translate.google.com.  Neither site is offering "angel" as a suggestion.  Yet in Matthew 1:20, the phrase:・・・主の使いが夢に現れて言った。is found in English as:. . . an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said . . . Does it mean "angel" or not  Is the Japanese saying something slightly different than "God no angel"  Thanks!
My book explains that あれで can be used to indicate mild surprise, and gives some example sentences. They all make sense to me except this one:今日{きょう}の食堂{しょくどう}の定食{ていしょく}、あれでよく改善{かいぜん}したって言{い}えるよね。まるで豚{ぶた}のえさだよ。In the first sentence, the speaker seems to be pleasantly surprised at the quality of the cafeteria meal. But in the second, he says it's like pig food. Is the first sentence sarcastic Is something else going on there
I'm writing a section of a relay manga for Hokkaido University's Manga Research Society.How you do you express "You and I both know full well..." and "our actual skills" in formal お嬢様っぽい JapaneseI have translated it from:"You and I both know full well that our strength isn’t physical fighting.  You really don’t want me to hurl such a heavy encyclopedia at such a pretty face, now, do you  So instead of that, let’s compete by using our actual skills."as:「運動能力には、私たちは運動が得意ではない、二人ともよく知っているでしょうね。こんなに重い百科事典を、そんなにきれい顔に投げ付けさせることをしたくありませんね。その代わり、実績のスキルでバトルしましょうよ。」Is 運動競技 or 実戦 better than 運動能力Is another word more suitable than 実績
I recently started talking with a Japanese "pen friend" on Skype, and I'd like to ask her "Should we speak in Japanese or English"If I said:わたしたちは　日本語を　はなしますか。　英語を　はなしますか。does that convey what I'm trying to say Or is there a better way to express itI would appreciate it if you could reply in kana, I know precious few kanji.

I'm really confused about the meanings of these two similar adjective inflections:高い ---&gt; 高くっても高い ---&gt; 高くとも　　難{むずか}しい ---&gt; 難しくっても難しい ---&gt; 難しくとも　　"っても" might possibly be less formal( because of the "っ"), but I known that there is a fundamental difference in meaning. And, I don't understand. What are some example usage sentences that contrast the meanings, as well as a good explanation in English thanks.
I read many times the expression くそかわ referred to babies, what does it exactly mean in englishI know that くそ means "damn" while かわ comes from かわいい, rightSo damn cuteThank you!
I don't quite get how あります is used in the following sentences from the Genki textbook:あなたの学校に何がありますか。デパートに何がありますか。動物園に何がいますか。あなたの国に何がありますか。あなたの家に何がありますか。Is あります used as in "where," "what," or "what's there" Thanks!
Can someone explain why 持った is used in place of 持っている in the following sentence　(from Monday's Japan Times)会話能力を持った初の人間型ロボットキロボが宇宙飛行士の若田幸一さんと国際宇宙ステーションで雑談した。The first humanoid robot with speech capability to be in space made small talk with Koichi Wakata on the International Space Station.Based on the answer to the:Use of ~ていた vs ~ている to refer to a resultant stateit sounds like the meaning does not significantly change. After referring to the transalation  持った felt more appropriate, possibly because the sentence was in the past tense (ie 雑談した).If this is correct then, I wonder, if the sentence finished with 雑談している or 雑談していた then would 持っている or 持っていた be more appropriate(My feeling is that 持っている would be appropriate in both the latter two cases. 雑談していた would be appropriate if the writer wanted to either (1)set the scene in the past (and the robot no-longer existed/had the ability to talk) or (2) just simply the robot no-longer exists/no-longer has the ability to talk, but cannot be sure of this.)
Japanese grammar has a rich subset of grammatical forms named 敬語 ("keigo", formal language or respect's language).The rules allowing to transform a normal verb into a keigo verb are complex and I'm stuck with a difference I found here on a well-documented site.For each verb it seems that there are TWO ways to create infinitive keigo forms :o either お + [い-stem] &amp; に なるo either お + [い-stem] &amp; なさるBy example : 変える (kaeru) becomes either お変えになる either お変えなさる.I don't understand if the difference between these two forms is merely formal (like in French : je m'assois, je m'assieds) or if these two verbal forms are used in different linguistic contexts.
I am participating in a relay manga through a university student group in Japan, and the previous member's contributed pages to the manga about a 女子力バトル introduced a sole male character who seems to be a team member in the competition.  I need to draw the next section of the manga.The captain of the opposing team protests his appearance by saying, 「そっちだって男がまざってんじゃん。」The next speech bubble is not clear as to which of the two characters is speaking, either the male or the opposing team's captain.It says,「女子力もクソもねーだろ。」Is the male character replying to her that he doesn't have 女子力  (Does ねー mean ない)Is it possibly the captain accusing him of not having 女子力Or do the も have another meaningThank you very much!

I'm having some difficulty with the various verbs that exist for bending and turning and could really use some insight into them:曲がる - Intransitive曲げる - Transitive回る - Intransitive回す - TransitiveJDIC additionally lists 転じる, which I'm not familiar with.I get the feeling that the 曲-based ones are more of a "bending" or "one-time turning" concept while the 回-based ones are more of a turning/rotating/spinning concept.  More cyclical, you know

Today I saw this sentence:イラクで戦争がある。I didn't understand why that would be the case instead of イラクに because if it is で I feel like it could be rewritten:戦争はイラクである。 which just sounds like Iraq is war.Is there a reason for this Is it an expression or something like that, can it be rewritten the way I wrote it and if so could you say 戦争はイラクですThanks for your help
I was thinking about Japanese passive and made the following example壊すー&gt;壊される which means to be brokenBut looking at the English definition of "to be broken", isn't there another Japanese word for that being, 壊れる？ How are these two different in meaning and use, and are the differences the same in all verbs that can act like that, e.g 汚される and 汚れる？Thanks!
I was under the impression that signs requesting that people do things would be in honorific rather that humble speech, however so far I've noticed the opposite.Could anyone please explain why this is
sorry that I could not come-up with a better title...  The readings of the kanjis in a person's name, is theoretically arbitrary. But in reality, a kanji tends to have a set of maybe 3 or 4 probable readings when used in a name. For example: 伊, under the "Japanese names" header, has the following probable readings: "いと、これ、ただ、だ、よし". So, what is the official name for that set of readingsa kanji has:(-) 訓読み(-) 音読み(-)  読み &lt;--- set of the most frequently used readings in people's names.what is the set name
I'm reading a children's story called きつつき商売. Here's an excerpt:『音屋』それだけでは、なんだか分かりにくいので、きつつきは、そのあとにこう、書きました。「できたての音、すてきないい音、おきかせします。四分音符一こにつき、どれでも１００リル」I'm assuming リル is some sort of currency, but all of my normal internet searches aren't helping me figure out specifically what it is. What could リル mean in this context
How does one say "this is like/similar to that" or "this is not like that" in Japanese in essence An example sentence is "In this way, the English are like the Japanese"; I have not been able to find any materials detailing this (but a whole lot on how to say something is better/worse, which is not helpful!).
Is the word マガ a shortened form for マガジン
I am quite confused as to how "見る" has suddenly changed into another word, albeit similar meaning when you do this: "見な."My question is, how has the "na" appeared and the "ru" disappear
These are the sentences:ユニオンへサンドイッチを買いに行きました。ユニオンへサンドイッチを買って行った。Are they both grammatically correct  Also do they both mean the same thing, which by my translation is "I went to the union and bought a sandwich."Do they only differ in their formality with the second sentence being more casual
いいかと聞かれたら、いいわけないと答えるなThe second part of the sentence is bother me. If いいわけない must mean "no excuse", then the rough translation will be: "When you asking "It's ok" don't answer "no excuse". So, how the second part is translating
こんにちは　皆さん、I want to use first, second, etc. in a sentence, i.e. say "first car, first love, etc". In this case, would using　の　be correct as the linking particle, e.g.　いちばんの車、　いちばんの愛ありがとう　ございます！
In Final Fantasy IV, a character says this line:陛下にもお考えがあってのことだ。  "His Majesty must have his reasons [for sending you to steal the crystal]."Contextually, it does not make sense for it to be "His Majesty must also have his reasons." or "Even His Majesty must have his reasons."So, what exactly is the meaning of the も here (大辞林 lists a 尊敬 usage of 「にも」, could that be what this is Does that mean に alone would not show 尊敬)Context:  「僕は、陛下の命令で暗黒剣を極めた。 でもそれはバロンを守る為で、罪もない人々から略奪をする為ではなかったはずだ。」  「そんなに自分を責めるな。 陛下にもお考えがあってのことだ。」  「カイン、お前が羨ましいよ。」
We can use の as a substitute in successive sentences for something we've already mentioned so that we don't need to keep saying what it is:どのTシャツが好き？　→　赤いのが好き。Then there is the possessive/associative の:家の屋根、空の鳥、etc.I was telling my friend about a new wallet I bought.  By implication (or obviousness), it means the wallet I had before is now the "old wallet".  So I wanted to talk about the contents of the old wallet.  Can I use these two のs consecutively to describe them, like:古いの　の　中身Is this grammatical  Used  Or would it be better to just say 古い｛財布・もの・やつ｝の中身
A charger is a machine. Why is it 器 not 機
I'm learning Japanese, but I'm still very early on in my education (Rosetta Stone, some books and a Japanese-speaking friend). I'm pretty sure I'm grasping the basic concepts okay, but I'm having issues when hearing other people speak the language. Specifically, right now, hearing the "ん" sound.When hearing a word like おんなのこ spoken, how do I know this word is written おんなのこ and not おなのこ To me, the pronunciation is extremely similar. Is there a rule or any tips that will help me discern when I am hearing "んな" ("nna") as opposed to "な" ("na") (Also "んの" instead of simply "の", you know what I mean.)
Ex:美しい空が美しいままでありますように／空の如く、水の如くI've seen a few things on the former, but nothing in my materials mentions anything about the latter. Everything I have turned up has revealed precious little about it. Anyone have any info
I have read this to learn about ように:http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar/surunaruPart - 1Going by the definition of よう which is more like "appearance/manner", I don't quite get how the constructions are made in which ように has more of an interpretation of "so that". I have read its similar counterpart, ために and the difference between them (Difference between ために and ように), but I still can't arrive how from the literal meaning of appearance or like, we can reach a meaning like "so that"Ex 1: 速く泳げるように、毎日練習しています。Part - 2As per my understanding, we need to use ように to allow us to modify a verb with another verb. But when we use the negative form of the verb in plain form (ない form), it is more like an adjective. So why do we use "ーないように some other verb".Ex 1: 忘れないようにつけてあるんです（丸をつける）- I have marked the circles so that I don't forget.Ex 2: 工場ができてから、この近くの海では泳げなくなりました。 Since the completion of the factory, I was not able to swim in the nearby sea.As example 2 shows ーなくなります is also used. What difference to the meaning will ーないようになる addThanks for any help.
(-) Strictly with regard to meaning, "あそこ" and "あちら" are exactly the same, right (of course, "あそこ" also has a slang meaning).(-) Isn't "あちら" used more in writing "あそこ" used in speaking  (-) Isn't "あそこ" used in speaking because it sounds more pleasant I am a native English speaker, and the "soft o" sound is pleasing to my ear and can be said very quickly. Does anyone agree, or am I crazy to say this(-) "あちら" would be the only appropriate option in formal conversations, rightWhile I've heard "こちら" and "そちら" a lot, I've never heard "あちら". In fact, I had to check in my dictionary to verify it is even a word. Answers to these questions will help me decide about incorporating "あちら" into my speaking.
I'd like to know the word for "question" itself. For example if I wanted to say:I have a questionわたしは (question) があります。I've had a hard time finding an answer to this question because when I search, Google turns up results for question words instead, and I'd rather ask a fluent speaker than a dictionary.I'd also like to know what counter should be used for counting questions, and if it is regular (so if, when pronouncing the number before the counter it just follows the regular sequence of いち, に, さん, し etc. or if there are any exceptions.)Apologies for asking three questions, I can move them onto separate threads if need be, but they're all related which is why I didn't.
I cannot completely grasp the meaning of 蹴り脚 in the following sentence. I would translate it as "the hitting leg" or rather "the leg which is doing an act of hitting"(not the best way to express it but I guess it explained the point), however in this sentence it is unclear why it is used with jumping(跳躍). So I tried to make some sort of a translation, and I would really appreciate if you correct my mistakes."After-effect from the jump which forced floor to collapse (with the leg hit(蹴り脚で)), and primary lights(原色光) of 斑に乱舞する() and covered in blood disco ball, are the things that reflected in my sight- Inside there(その中にあって),  jet black longcoat flutter like a condensated(凝縮した) black, gouging out throw the darkness." ただ視界に映るのは、蹴り脚でフロアを陥没させた跳躍の爪痕と、斑に乱舞する血塗られたミラーボールの原色光ーー。その中にあって尚昏く、闇を抉り抜いて凝縮したのごとき漆黒ロングコートが翻る
Just wondering about the correct particles in this sentence...毎朝、何時にうちにでまか。Any help would be greatly appreciated :)
I know that people often ask [兄弟]{きょうだい}いますか but does this mean "do you have siblings" or just "do you have brothers".Since the answer would be different in either case:(Has a sister) "No, but I have a sister" or would it be "Yes, I have a sister"(Has a brother) "Yes I do"
Since 名前 can also mean full name, it would be nice to have a single word that is complimentary to 苗字. Is there one available for common use
I am learning JLPT N2. I came across these words in one sentence. I couldn't find the difference between 沸く【わく】, 炊く【たく】, 茹でる【ゆでる】, 煮る【にる】, and 蒸す【むす】.All the words have similar meanings. Can anyone tell me the exact meanings and situations where the above words are used
In English you can use conjunction to express two simultaneous actions:I was standing in front of an audience and presenting a new technology.Or simply juxtapose two participles where one modifies the other:I was standing in front of an audience, presenting a new technology.Am I correct to suppose that in Japanese you would use something like 立って、出していました (i.e. juxtaposed -te form verbs) for both variants
I would like to be able to say X percent of something, but I haven't been able to find the particle that would correspond to of. Could you use の？　For example:人口の10パーセント　(10 percent of population)
One of my textbooks is telling me that the sentence using ながら below is incorrect… いすにすわりながら、音楽を聞いている人はウィリアムさんです。…whilst the following sentence is correct. いすにすわって、音楽を聞いている人はウィリアムさんです。Translation: That person sitting on the chair (whilst) listening to music is William.However, a later example illustrating the use of ながら is this:ヘンリーさんは音楽を聞きながら、ダンスをしている。- Henry is dancing whilst listening to music.Now I can’t the tell difference between the correct use of ながら and the apparently incorrect one.
A quick Edict, Kotobank, Excite.co.jp, and Goo search on ガム shows that it is an abbreviation for チューインガム.Google results for ガム also seems to suggest so. (Notice that the results only show チューインガム and no 風船ガム)But can ガム be used to mean "bubble gum", or is it actually already a codified term for "chewing gums"Take for example we have both a chewing gum and a bubble gum on a table. Will "ガム持ってきて" be ambiguous because ガム can refer to both items Or would it non-ambiguous because in that context, ガム will most surely be referring to the chewing gumNote: Bubble gums can be blown, like a balloon coming straight out of the mouth. Chewing gums can't achieve that, no matter how hard one tries.
According to my dictionary both of them mean "lecture".But is there any difference between them in nuance
For example if i say something like,"あなたはやさしい人です”。Versus if I say,"あなたはやさしい人". Is the second sentence (stated above) grammatically correct or does there "need" to be a particle at the end of my sentence I appreciate all the help I can get from you wonderful people.Please give me your knowledge and help me better educate my self.~A man seeking to improve himself
I brushed up on the use of Japanese commas (読点) here, but I don't think it explained this usage I found on 知恵袋.The sentence is this:忙しい、の対義語に当たる形容詞は何でしょうか。Why exactly is the OP using the comma like this The rule of thumb for me in English is that if you pause when speaking, you should use a comma in writing. I've just carried that over to Japanese somewhat, but this sentence would sound very unnatural to my (non-native) ears if one where to pause after 忙しい. Is that just not the case Is this a standard use of the 読点 or internet slang, or...
When I have written "音読み{おんよみ}" and "訓読み{くんよみ}" in romaji as: "onyomi" and "kunyomi" I have been almost always corrected. "Onyomi" is changed to "on'yomi", and "kunyomi" is changed to "kun'yomi".  (1) Are these corrections made because "音読み" and "訓読み" are 重箱読み{じゅうばこよみ}  (2) Is inserting a single quote between the "on" and "kun" readings in a "重箱読み" a standard convention (and not just the editor's preference) A url link to information regarding this convention would be appreciated. I'm interested in any/all conventions for writing in romaji.  (3) If I am indeed being corrected because they are 重箱読み、 then by extension all 重箱読み, when written in romaji, should have a single quote between the "on" and "kun" readings, right
お父さんに愛されていると信じて疑わないように、周りの人も優しいのが普通だと思ってたYeah, ように mean "as/like". So this must translating like "I thought that it's normal when people around are kind to me like believe that dad loves me."  Or not
The following is an exercise from Tae Kim's Guide.I have to pick は or が to fill in the blanks:ジム）アリス　____　誰？ボブ）友達だ。彼女　____　アリスだI think we should use は after アリス in the first sentence, but I'm confused about the second sentence.  I think it should be は after 彼女, but the correct answer is apparently が.  Could someone please explain
大学で勉強をしたいです。大学で勉強したいです。As far as I can tell both translate to - "I want to study at university". I'm just wondering if one sounds more 'natural' in Japanese than the other and indeed whether either structure is more approriate in different situations or not.
In the finale of a drama called お天気お姉さん, around 8:26 in, I saw this subtitle:一ヶ月前の僕のアリバイかいBut the pronunciation of 一ヶ月前 sounded either like いっかつまえ or いっかすまえ to me, with no sign whatsoever of げ. The two speakers in the dialogue are male and both have pronounced that word the same way. One final detail I can add is that I've noticed quite a bit of 関西弁 spoken in this. Is this slang A regional dialect I can't find any info about this kind of contraction.Update: Here's the clip(sorry it took 4 months ^^ ): http://clyp.it/ckzojuca
We are using the textbook "Adventures in Japanese," and in class we got up to this activity:  Begin a conversation with your partner with the comments below. Your partner agrees, then gives his/her opinion starting with でも and using the ～ば～ほど pattern.Example as written:  質問： 数学って、むずかしいね。  答え：ええ。でも、勉強すればするほど、分かるようになるよ。１．質問：漢字って、むずかしいね。We spent like 15-20 minutes in class trying to figure out an answer that works: our sensei says there is something wrong no matter how many times we try to answer that we aren't realizing.How I tried to answer:ええ。でも、勉強すればするほど新聞が読めるようになるよ。other questions: 日本語って、むずかしいね。  お茶って、苦いね。  茶道って、つまらないね。  Any insight Thank you.
パーティーに何か持って行きましょうか。My translation – “Do you want to hold/wait on going to the party”Is this translation correct basically I wasn’t sure if ‘to hold’ could be used in the same sense as ‘to wait’ in Japanese as is the case in English as when I look up 持つ in my dictionary it doesn’t give a possible meaning of ‘to wait’.
I am trying to understand the role of するって and its meaning.Taking the phrase:２４じかんこうどう　ともに　するって　こういうことI can't give a meaning to it. Any help
The sentence in question:私は日本からあそびに来た友達にロンドンをあんないしてあげた。My translation - I guided my friend who is coming from Japan around London.I know that あそぶ can be used to mean 'hang out with', and that’s what I'm guessing it means here, but I'm struggling to translate it into English and have it sound right with the rest of the sentence. You wouldn't say for instance "I guided my friend, whom I hang out with, who is coming from Japan around London" - It just sounds odd. Could it be translated as "A friend whom I hang out with is coming from Japan and I guided him/her around London"
The kanji for 鉄拳 seems to suggest that the word means "iron fist". However, various dictionaries suggests that the meaning is simply "fist".For example, Edict shows that the meaning for 鉄拳 is "fist", and the meaning for 鉄拳制裁 is "punishment by striking with fist".Kotobank, Excite.co.jp, and Goo also show that the meaning is "a (clenched) fist".Does 鉄拳 mean "fist" or "iron fist"How does it's meaning and usage compare with 拳 (こぶし)
Old title: Conditional patterns comparisonRecently, I stumbled on new grammar patterns using the conditional form the following way (and I could not find an explanation in any of my grammar books) :名詞・形容動詞＋なら＋形容動詞＋で連用形＋たら＋た＋で動詞: 已然形＋ば＋連用形＋た＋で形容詞: 已然形＋ば＋終止形＋で形容動詞: 已然形＋ば＋語根＋で名詞: であれば+ 名詞 ＋ でExample: 休んだら休んだで、たくさんやることがある。The author of the website that explains this pattern says that the particles で can be replaced (in most case) by ほど.In which case, で is better that ほど　I modify the question, what is the meaning of this pattern The website which explains the pattern is here.
These are the two sentences in question:いいえ、まだしません。いいえ、まだしていません。From my understanding they both mean something like "No, I didn't yet" or even simply "No, not yet" but there must be a difference in translation/meaning or application that I'm missing obviously based around the ています which is present continuous correct
According to WWWJDIC and ALC, 耐性 is used for drug tolerance (e.g., 耐性現象), but 耐容 is used for radiation (e.g. 耐容線量). Based on that, my guess is that 耐性 can be used to express neutral effects like decrease in drug effectiveness, while 耐容 expresses limitations on harm.Is this a strict distinction Does the distinction exist at all
What is the meaning of this exclamation aloneふざけずに！I know that ふざける means to kid - to play and that ずに means without, so it could be "without kidding" but it doesn't sound right to me.
確認というか念を押しとくが I don't really get the meaning of this sentence. Does it mean to remind, to confirm something, or to make sure of somethingThe whole sentence is:そう言えば  確認というか念を押しとくが The context: two friends are talking and suddenly one says this line, changing the topic of the conversation.
I think that the Wikipedia entry for "kanji" has an error.Please look at the last sentence in the third paragraph underneath the "kun'yomi" heading. quote: "...This contrasts with on'yomi, which are monosyllabic, and is unusual..."My understanding is that none of "しゃく"、"ちょく"、"にゃく"、.... are monosyllabic.If I am correct about this, can someone with greater standing than mine make the appropriate change to the "kanji" Wikipedia entry
じゃあ, 一緒にこれ飲もうよ。さっきマネージャーに差し入れでもらってさ。Well, マネージャー is manager. If here was "dispenser" instead "manager" it would be understandable. So what "manager" doing here
what is the meaning of the expression すげえまずい alone I've never read it before.Thank you.
This is the sentence in question from one of my text books.学生がいませんから、パブもシティーセンターも静かになります。My Translation - "There are no students so the pubs and city centre become quiet." Why is it も and not と separating パブ and シティーセンター and then another も before 静か which I don't understand at all
I think I have an idea of the differences but I'm not sure. My goal was to say "put [something] on the floor". To me, 床{ゆか}の上 sounds the best (not that means anything). For example: 服を床の上に置きます。The dictionary definition of 床上{ゆかうえ} is 建物の床の上。また、床から上。. It looks it has more of a "above floor level" or "from the ground up" meaning, but I still see the English translation of "on a floor" (i.e. Rikaiちゃん). Is this misleading, or would something like 服を床上に置きます workLastly, where would just plain old 床{ゆか} fit into this Does it have a connotation of the floor or a bed Is it ambiguous if I just said 服を床に置きます (If so, does 床の上 not have that ambiguity)Bonus Credit: Have I missed anything that means "on the floor"
This is the example sentence from one of my textbooks. 時間があるから、昼ごはんを食べて行かない？ Textbooks translation - "We have some time so how about we grab a bite to eat and then go"I don't understand why the ない form here doesn't translate to a present negative like 'grab a bite to eat and don't go" hence my confusion over its meaning. Either the translation is somehow off (unlikely), this sentence  is simply incorrect (unlikely) or theres some rule I'm forgetting or don't know about (very much likely). Please help.
This is the full sentence いつもいつも計算して買えっつてだろうが。It's very colloquial but I can't understand this part 買えっつてだろうが。 Why is written like this 買えっつて Thank you!
I frequently hear this pattern when watching Japanese TV.From a japanese native's perspective is this the only meaning to it:"I think I want to ~"
There is a question in JLPT Prep book Kanzen Master N2 that confuses me:一緒に料理を（　）食べませんか。  a. 作って 　b.作ってから 　c.作った上でVた上で suggests a cause/effect relationship so c is obviously wrong.a is right but I want to know why b is wrong It's grammatically wrong or is there a problem with the meaning in this case.
As stated in the title the reading for 文言 can be もんごん or ぶんげん. I know that もんごん is almost always used in speech, but why do two readings exist and why is もんごん so much more common Also, are their any specific circumstances when ぶんげん is preferred
When I look at Chinese vs Japanese calligraphy samples and books, it seems to me that there are subtly different aesthetic principles governing the characters, even discounting variants (including stroke order switches etc) and different formal styles.  For argument's sake, let's limit the argument to 楷書 where things would be expected to be the same.  Can an expert (or even a knowledgeable layman) see a sample of 楷書 and identify it as Japanese or Chinese Or are the variations between calligraphers wide enough that national identity does not stand out as a distinguishing factor
私がびくびく怯えて過ごしてるせいで、彼まで過敏になってる気がするThis まで confusing me. In this case it's translating like "even", right
(だれかこの単語の使いかたを説明してくれますか。辞典にはたくさんの意味が載っているようです。)Can someone explain the usage of this term 出鱈目{でたらめ} to me  It seems to have a lot of meanings.
I just came across a sentence that used 男子トイレ and 女子トイレ and it got me wondering. What is the difference (if there is one) between the 男子トイレ and the 男性トイレ, and of course between the 女子トイレ and the 女性トイレ.In English I would say the "men's room" and "boys' room" are, for the most part, interchangeable, but I wouldn't use "men's" to refer to a bathroom in a primary school, or use "boys'" in a formal setting.If I had to guess I would say that this is the case in Japanese as well, or if not it was simply a change in the degree of formality.
I came across 当て字 in my N1 vocabulary list, and while I think I understand what it is from the definition "kanji used as a phonetic symbol, rather than for its meaning", I'm not sure what the point of that is--there's already hiragana and katagana to do that.What is the purpose or purposes of 当て字
The complete sentence is this なにあれ私好みなんだけど、もらっちゃっていい？Is it a way to ask permissionThank you.
The Progressive-Japanese English Dictionary suggests 含める is the same as one meaning of 含む but it is not explained. Is this correct I have two theories:1. 含める= 含む when the latter means include/containThis is based on the following examples鉄分を含んだ水｜water containing ironその団体には女性2人が含まれている｜The group includes two women.And:子供を含めて300人だ｜There are 300 people, including the children.郵送料を含めて5,000円だった｜It cost 5,000 yen, postage included.Which leads me to think:水が鉄分を含む　＝　水が鉄分を含める　（Water contains iron)However we don't seem to find the following use: 鉄分を含める水This leads me to (2):2. 含める is used when the action of one party actively includes an object within in a group (which is grammatically an indirect object)As in the following example:彼らの名をリストに含めた｜We included their names on the list.Even in the following cases an indirect object seems to be implied郵送料を含めて5,000円だった｜It cost 5,000 yen, postage included.私は税金を含めて月40万円の収入がある｜I have an income of 400,000 yen a month before taxes.Because they could easily be rewritten:If I include postage, it cost 5000 yen.If I include tax, my monthly income is 400,000 yen.or,Could we also write the following:郵送料を含んだ5,000円だった私は税金を含んだ月40万円の収入があるIf so then these two verbs are interchangeable when the sense of include/contain is takenPlease let me know if my question is not clear.
How would "I had an exam yesterday" be translatedきのうテストをありました。きのうテストをしました。If both of the above are correct, what is the difference between them
The phrase "いと高き" occurs pretty frequently in the Japanese 新改訳 bible in the book of Daniel.Doing a little sleuthing I'm also seeing いと低き and 素晴らしき as somewhat similar constructions. I get that いと means exceedingly as an adverb that modifies the adjective.素晴らしき哉、人生Gloria in excelsis Deo -&gt; 天のいと高きところには神に栄光あれ"Give me the lowest place" -&gt;  いと低き處(ところ)を給へかし (http://www1.ocn.ne.jp/~megumi-c/sub1/sub2/Rossetti.htm)What is this conjugation calledHow does this ーき conjugation workIs the set of 形容詞 that receive it limitedCan the いと prefix only be used with this conjugation
So, I was watching an anime, whereupon I found the following text (cf. screencap):夜ト・春夏冬中  ０９０－ｘｘｘｘ－＃＃３ｘ  どんなお悩みも解決いたします！This text appears in the context of the character 夜ト trying to find work. I'm having difficulty figuring out what 春夏冬 means. If you just glue the on readings for those three characters together, you get しゅんかとう, which only seems to appear as the name of various establishments. I also found that this can apparently be read in a punny way as あきない (since 春夏冬 is all the seasons but 秋). I'm guessing that the correct reading of 春夏冬 in this context is あきない since しゅんかとう doesn't fit. But what does that actually mean I doubt it's 秋がない / 秋ではない / "not autumn", given that that doesn't make sense in context. This term doesn't seem to appear in any of the standard online dictionary searches (kotobank, goo.ne.jp, weblio, nor even in zokugo-dict), so I'm kind of at a loss here.
Can somebody explain the grammar and meaning of this expression in the sentence below It may be  just my poor understanding of how なりません functions in the language but I'd appreciate an explanation. I have added my own translation and placed the previous sentence in [ ] to indicate context. [人間を人類というより大きな範疇（＝カテゴリー）でみても、人間は「かろうじて生きている」のが現状ではないかと思う。しかし、]  人類はそうやすやすと滅びないように思えてなりません。[Even if I look at the human beings from wider perspective than as a members of the human race, it seems to me that humans are only just surviving. However,] I have to think that the human race will not be that easily defeated.For full context see: 中上級のにほんご Dec 2013, p37My grammatical logic________________I have translated the whole expression as 'I have to think'(~ I cannot help coming to the conclusion that..) but when I compare to expressions such as ~なければならない (ie must) this does not seem logical. For example:If :~滅びると思いません　＜〜＞　滅びないと思いますThen~滅びると思ってなりません　　＜〜＞　滅びないと思わなけばなりません
It is commonly taught that the polite way to refuse an invitation is "ちょっと。。。"However, how do you refuse an invitation, while giving a reason For example, would it still be considered polite to say something like, "ちょっとむり、[reason]"Conversely, if someone replied to you with "ちょっと。。。", how would you politely ask them why

I recently came across the word 「結構くせ」. Haven't found any entries for it in the usual places (zokugo-dict, WWWJDIC, etc.) According to kotobank, 結構人 is a synonym for お人好し.Is 結構くせ the (negative) habit of being an お人好しContext: （省略）…消費者には、結構くせがある。
I'm reading the section on sanseido.net about how entries from a certain dictionary are laid out but I'm having a little trouble understanding the section below. As far as I can tell, ▼ is put on the right of non-Jouyou kanji (as in the first example). I can't quite figure out what ▽ or 《　》 are used for. What is「常用漢字表」の「付表」(2) 常用漢字とその音訓を表示した。【　】の中の漢字が「常用漢字表」にないものには「 ▼ 」、その漢字が「常用漢字表」にはあるが見出しに相当する音訓が示されていないものには「 ▽ 」を漢字の右肩に付した。また、「常用漢字表」の「付表」の語は 《　》で囲んで示した。う ごう　 －がふ　[0] 【 烏▼合 】お たけび　を－　[2][0] 【 雄叫▽び 】かわせ　かはせ　[0] 【《為替》】さ なえ　 －なへ　[0] 【《早苗》】Also, unrelated to the main question, but does anyone know what the [2][0] is referring to I was thinking something to do with pitch accent but why are there two numbers Two different possible pitches
Recently, I've been using Siri in Japanese to set cooking timers. I've noticed she pronounced the「フ」in「十五分」clearly as /hu/, not /fu/.From Wikipedia:Old Japanese does not have /h/, but rather /ɸ/ (preserved in modern fu, /ɸɯ/), which has been reconstructed to an earlier /*p/.Also from Wikipedia:It represents the phoneme /hu͍/, although for phonological reasons, the actual pronunciation is [ɸu͍].The sound sample in the Wikipedia article does sound more like /fu/.While I understand it's basically the same phoneme for the Japanese, I do hear the difference. Hence the question.Is the Siri's variant acceptable
If "senpai" means someone's senior, then if I am the senior what do I call my freshman i.e. the one who is younger than me in the same school or something. How do I address them
Here is a passage from my Japanese Bible更に、悪魔はイエスを非常に高い山に連れて行き、世のすべての国々とその繁栄ぶりを見せて、「もし、ひれ伏してわたしを拝むなら、これをみんな与えよう」と言った。すると、イエスは言われた。「退け、サタン。『あなたの神である主を拝み、ただ主に仕えよ』と書いてある。」　－　マタイによる[福音書]{ふく・いん・しょ}４章：８－１０節Then the Devil took Jesus to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in all their greatness.  "All this I will give you, " the Devil said, "if you kneel down and worship me."  Then Jesus answered, "Go away, Satan!  The scripture says, 'Worship the Lord your God and serve only him!' " - Matthew 4:8-10So the choices we have are しりぞけ, どけ, ひけ, and のけ.  I know all of these readings overlap at least somewhat in meaning, so I'm not really sure which one is best.  I think どけ would be more for "get out of my way" rather than "go away", but that would imply some kind of movement on Jesus' part (the pre- and proceeding verses don't indicate he was walking or otherwise mobile).  しりぞけ just sounds too long and unnatural, although that's just a subjective assessment.  ひけ feels the most natural to me.So which one is it  Or is more than one acceptable in this context
There are two readings of 人, as in these two examples: 恋人【こいびと】 and 素人【しろうと】Why is 素人 (among others) the way it is and not しろひと or しろびとFurthermore, 狩人 is かりゅうど. Why is the final mora voiced here
甘い蜜 literally means "sweet honey". But in some sentences it seems to mean something different. For example,1) たまに甘い蜜を与えて、また暗闇に落として……。From time to time giving a sweet honey, but also dropping into darkness.2) 結局、甘い蜜を吸うのはいつだって上の連中だけ。After all, only they always suck a sweet honey. 3) お前をそそのかし、甘い蜜を与え、そして最後には堕落させてやる。I instigate you, give you sweet honey, and in the end corrupt you. Well, in the last sentence it must be "give you a pleasure". Anyway, I think that 甘い蜜 must mean something pleasurable, something that makes people happy.My question is: what is the meaning of 甘い密 in sentences like these
I cannot get my head around the verb 「済ます」／「済まされない」 in this sentence.月10万円では済まされない。I found this in the プログレッシブ和英中辞典 on goo dictionary's page for the verb 「済ます」. The page says that the sentence means I can't make do with 100,000 yen a month.This is fine, I think I can understand the sentence and if I see something like this in the future I think I can recognize it.However, as the goo dictionary page is about 「済ます」 and not 「済む」 I'm bound to think that [済まされない] is the passive conjugation of the former. But, if I translate this to English or to my native tongue (Hungarian) the sentence/expression/meaning doesn't sounds passive (to me) at all (forgive me if my translating skills are way off about this).Can someone explain to me how the verb or verb conjugation can be interpreted "passively" in sentences Thanks!
I've seen a couple times examples of using this format of [noun] の [adjective] and I mostly see it in the form ~の高いSome specifics I'm referring to are:人気の高い柔軟性の高いI can't think of any more off the top of my head; I encounter it most frequently with 人気の高いWhy isn't が used there Or I've even heard 人気のある[noun]Any insight into this would really help out. Thanks!

I have found a dictionary definition of これもまた, (meaning roughly "this is also") so I'm assuming that this is a shortened version of it. What troubles me is I can't find it without the また, so I wonder if it is very informal or if it shouldn't be used in polite writing/speech. Any insight on this would be really helpful.今の文学青年はセンチメンタルになることを怖れている。これも傷つけられるのを怖れる一種のさもしい心のあらわれかも知れない
I cannot grasp what  にも means between 身のほど知らず and 敵対する愚 in the following sentence, maybe something like "foolishness of taking up arms not knowing their place" As far as I can understand the sentence:"Let them taste true fear. Make them remember the foolishness of (身のほど知らずにも) taking up arms against our nation and our people, and then allow them to savor their bitter victory!"奴らには恐怖を与えろ。この国に、我々に、身のほど知らずにも敵対する愚を思い知らせ、後に矮小な勝利をくれてやれ。Thank you!
私は犬が殺す // Watashi wa inu ga korosuMeans I am killed by a dog私は犬を殺す // Watashi wa inu o korosuMeans I killed a dogRight I want an in-depth answer for this if I was wrong.
I recently came across this sentence:たかしは7時ごろうちに帰りました。 I do understand that it probably means たかし came home at around 7, but from what I learnt to say "around 7" it's:７時ごろ.So it has no うち.  In other words, the うち is throwing me off.Can someone explain this to me
The line （線は違う？） in Soran Bushi that says 男度胸（おとこどきょ）なら　五尺（ごしゃく）のからだどんと乗り出せ　波の上　チョイー what does it literally mean I think I know the words, but I can't understand what they mean from those meanings... I thought it means Men, if you are brave, your five feet of body... Then I don't know what don to noridase means- don like the sound, and I'm lost as to the meaning of noridase, and why it's imperative.
(Background: similar circumstances as this question; the speaker is a sleazy low-level gangster commenting on sex workers in his employ.)「駄目な人間は、駄目なものだな。まったく、愛想が尽きるよ。ほかじゃ、鼻もひっかけないような大年増に、きまりの組合費だけで、シマを分けてやっているんだぜ。せっせと稼いで、足を洗うことでも考えたらどうなんだい。いまさら、ヒモに可愛がってもらえるような柄かって…」Breaking it up by sentence, here's what I've got (subject/topic marked in bold):駄目な人間は、駄目なものだな -- Hypothetical/general about people on the whole.まったく、愛想が尽きるよ -- The speaker complains that his incredible benevolence is wasted on such human failures.ほかじゃ、鼻もひっかけないような大年増に、きまりの組合費だけで、シマを分けてやっているんだぜ --  I think the speaker is saying, "If things were different, they'd [the sex workers would] be under some matron who'd go easy on them and only take the [mob] family cut off the top, and let 'em split the rest."せっせと稼いで、足を洗うことでも考えたらどうなんだい --  "How about they [the sex workers] put their backs into making money and think about getting out of this [criminal] trade, huh"いまさら、ヒモに可愛がってもらえるような柄かって… --  "[do the sex workers actually] Think they've still got what it takes to get favors from a pimp anymore"5a. Alternatively, "Do I look like the kind of pimp they can squeeze favors out of"I'm mostly unclear on 3 and 5.The question is, how do you know (especially for the native speakers) what the subject of the sentence is as it changes from sentence to sentence Initially what threw me for a loop was the cascade of increasingly unclear clauses (the speaker is monologuing, which doesn't help). (I've seen this before, but never so intensely as here in the efficient prose of 阿部公房)
How do I say "Twenty-two points of attack" in Japanese Rather new at Japanese so any help would be greatly appreciated.Edit....and since it was put on hold, I will edit in my "research". The only translation I could find was in Kanji which is 攻撃の 20 2 点. So I then researched the kanji character translations and found a site that actually had mp3 sound bites of how the characters are spoken. 攻撃 I found to mean "attack" (in the proper context I was trying to achieve). 攻 - spoken translation meaning "kou" and 撃 - spoken translation meaning "geki". I put the two together and searched for a translation of the word and, low and behold, "kougeki" was translated as "attack".のSimilar research, similar results... spoken translation "no", translated to "of"20 2 ...well "22". I am a little familiar with counting in Japanese so I attempted this one on my own and since the Kanji separated the "20" and the "2" I translated to "niju ni". A quick search proved my counting knowledge to be somewhat accurate so was satisfied with the result.点...this one was a bit trickier. Translated to "points". I could not locate this character so researched "points" with no results. However, I could find "point" which resulted in a spoken translation of "kyoten".Now to put it all together... Much like other languages, I noticed the Kanji is NOT in order so I can only assume that the translation to Japanese would be..."kougeki no niju ni kyoten" (or at least close to it)As I previously stated, I am fairly new at the Japanese language but very interested in learning.I hope my "research" will satisfy those who put the topic "on hold" to generate a proper response to see if I am on the right track.
For example, if I was trying to tell someone that in English when we say "sake" it already has the implication of it being "Japanese sake", so have the "Japanese" is redundant.My English brain wants to say AはBの意味を持つ, and my best guess is something with 伝える, I'm just having a really hard time researching this.
I recently asked about the differences between "くださいませんか" and "いただけませんか". But, I just realized I have a related question.Doesn't "くれない" have the same basic meaning as "ください" And, isn't it more polite, and less confrontational For example:"それを読んでください。"  &lt;-- direct / confrontational. spoken to someone beneath you."それを読んでくれない？"  &lt;-- same meaning and more polite  If that is correct, then I can be done with saying "ください". I've got respect and humility to pretty much everyone, so I'm just going to continue always saying "くれない". That makes sense, rightbtw: In the case of "見せる", I would say:"見してくれない？" instead of "見せてくれない？". Is this correct Is it like slang, or somethingthank you.
キスってやつしてみたかったなI've never read this expression before. I just know that やつす means to be absorbed, to lose yourself to, so I was gessing that maybe in this case it could mean:"I wanted to lose myself in a kiss"I am I right Or does it have a different meaningThank you a lot.
I've come to see [突然]{とつぜん} as "sudden in an almost overwhelming manner". The other two, however, I am unable to figure out.What are the differences between these words, and when is one more appropiate than the other
Specifically in the context of the following sentence, from 燃え尽きた地図 (1967):「おまけに、変に小才が効くから、余計にいけねえんだ。特に、飯場の連中に、ツケで飲み食いさせるようにしたのが、まずかったな。事務所の係長に、鼻薬をきかせたりしてよ、そのツケの代金を、給金から差っ引かせるようにしたんだな。」「なるほど…」「こんなところまで、出稼ぎに来て、なんの楽しみもありゃしねえ、ツケがきくとなりゃ、後で後悔するのは分かっていても、つい財布の紐が緩んでしまうって寸法さ。」Background: The speaker is describing a low-level gangster who is running a shady group of unlicensed meal trucks near a large rural construction site.I looked up 「つけ」 on zokugo-dict.com, but didn't find anything. Is he spiking the food with drugs, or what Why does he have to bribe his superior back in the city to do it
Is there a common way to express the reason for something after stating what the something is All the ways I can think of explaining situations involve putting it before. I.e. ～から～です. I was hoping to say something along the lines of "I had this thought because ~".
When native speakers of Japanese use おばあさん to refer to an older woman who is not that that individual's own grandmother, does their concept of the woman include any expectation that she would have had children at some point during her life
When I want to make 「それを見せて下さい。」 more formal, I always say 「それを見せて頂けませんか？」. But, I want to double-check this.   　　I never say 「それを見せて下さいませんか。」. While that seems perfectly fine, I don't think I've heard it used very much by native speakers. Rather, I think they more frequently say 「それを見せて頂けませんか？」.  (-) Is 「それを見せて頂けませんか？」 really used more frequently than 「それを見せて下さいませんか。」  (-) Ignoring any sort of "nuance", are there any cases where I cannot say 「それを見せて頂けませんか？」 and I must say 「それを見せて下さいませんか。」  thank you.
in the sentenceお前は思考に詰まるとすぐこれだ.I know that 言葉に詰まる means to be at loss of words Does 思考に詰まる mean to stop thinkingthank you!
I'm not sure if I'm just imagining things or if I remembered things wrong,but is there some kind of colloquial dialect where sentences end in "-jai"
I find that Japanese pitch accent seems to have some sort of interaction with the morphology. For example, 早い is pronounced [はやい]{LHL}, but 早く is pronounced [はやく]{HLL}.Are these changes regular No grammar book I have describes the interaction between accent and conjugation. I also find that the above pattern cannot be naively generalized ([すごい]{LHL} -&gt; [すごく]{LHL}), but perhaps there is a deeper reason why the accent changes on はやい
As the title implies, I want to know the difference between "出勤" and "通勤". Both of them mean "commuting to work" in English.And which should I choose in the following sentence:朝夕の（ａ．出勤　ｂ．通勤）ラッシュ時は電車が満員になる。
I would love to use Aozra Books as a learning tool, but the accuracy of its ふりがな concerns me.  This book, for example, claims 私 is pronounced わたくし instead of わたし.Is the former a proper pronunciation
At some point in history, ない replaced *あらない as the negative of ある, at least in the Kantō dialect (Kansai seems to have あらへん; あらん is also apparently attested in some dialects).When did this happen That is, when did なし and its descendants replace あらず and its descendants Were なし and あらず coexistent in the Heian period, or was one preferred over another I see both used in later CJ texts, but it feels strange that there are two words with exactly the same meaning for such a common idea (not exist).Currently, in polls etc you often see あり・なし as choices, rather than あり・あらず. Is this a Modern Japanese influence, or is this usage idiomatic (i.e. なし rather than あらず was seen as the obvious opposite of あり)Additionally, does なし and あらず have different nuances
Context: おれはおれの信念に後悔するような事は何一つやっちゃいねぇ！これからもそうだ！What does the ちゃい in やっちゃい mean  I suppose it's not やっちゃう aka やってしまう...
If I use an adjective to directly modify a noun how exactly would I conjugate it into the negative formFor exampleこれは　おおきい　やま　です。　-&gt; This mountain is largeIf I wanted to say "This mountain is not large" could I sayこれは　おおきくない　やま　です　or これは　おおきくありません　やま　ですor do those two examples above sound unnatural relative to something likeこの　やま　は　おおきくない　or この　やま　は おおきくありませんThanks!
Yes, this sounds like a really confusing question. But I suddenly realized that する seemed to be a perfectly regular 上二段活用 (kami nidan; upper bigrade) verb with a stem of s-:未然形: し (as in しない)連用形: し (as in して, します)終止形: す (fossil in words like 愛す, 決す)連体形: する已然形: すれ (as in すれば)命令形: しろ (せよ seems mostly dead)Is this a coincidence, or does サ変 have any sort of etymological connection with 上二段
I completely cannot grasp the meaning of 行きと違い here:夕食を終えた私は、なれない道に右往左往しながら寄宿舎へと向かっていた。行きと違い、友の案内がないだけで道を迷いそうになる。"After I finished the dinner, I wandered an unfamiliar road to the dormitory. 行きと違い, without my friend's guidance I almost lost my way."
Are the kanji in 世話【せわ】 as in 世話になります used for their meaning, or are they ateji If they aren't ateji, what exactly is the reasoning
While riding a train, I read a public service announcement that said:たばこを持つ手は、子供の顔の高さだった。Underneath, the English translation said:A lit cigarette is carried at the height of a child's face.  The Japanese is in the past tense while the English is in the present tense. As a native English speaker, I cannot easily see why the Japanese was written in the past tense. In what situations is Japanese written in the past tense when it would seem more natural to be in the present tense for English speakers like me
胃に穴でも開けるんじゃないかって、見てるこっちが心配になった。I see the point, but this かって confusing me. And んじゃない don't mean negative sense, right And I guess that 胃に穴でも開ける mean "Shit a brick" but I can be wrong. So, what かって mean here
In a course I attended about Japan, there was the mention of a "Steel and rice" coalition. I don't understand the concept, so I can't define it.When searching for the phrase, one match was for the following, in "Japan Transformed: Political Change and Economic Restructuring" by Frances McCall Rosenbluth and Michael F. Thies:The result was a "steel and rice" coalition backing the LDP, whereby  heavy industry provided money for campaigns and farmers turned out the  vote in large numbers.The book compares it with an "iron and rye" coalition in nineteenth-century Germany. This makes me suspect that there is not a Japanese phrase that gets translated into English as "steel and rice" coalition, but instead English-speakers merely made a snowclone based on "iron and rye".Is there a phrase that exists in Japanese that gets translated into English as "steel and rice" coalition
From a basic Japanese book I'm reading, I found that word in a vocabulary table. Now I'm having problems finding that word using Google, jisho.org, etc. I can find 大切な (taisetsuna) and that kanji sequence Is what I get if I type the romaji in Windows or Linux, but I don't see the other word as an option.
桜桜の歌詞で「匂いぞ出{い}ずる」と言った（どうやっていうの？）文があります。その文のぞはどういう意味ですか？助詞じゃないですか？I don't really know how well I structured that. In any case, what is the functionality of ぞ in さくらさくら I can only find web definitions for emphasis, at the end of sentences.
I'm not sure when should I use particle の in front of だろう/でしょうIs のだろう used when the speaker wonders about something to himselfFor example, what would be the translation of these sentences:日本は、これからますます高齢化が進むだろう。It seems that lately the aging in Japan is increasing.最近、デパートの売り上げが伸びている。景気が回復しているのだろう。Store's sales increased. I wonder if the business is recovering何をするのだろうか。What could I do
Tae Kim translates the following as:他にいいものがたくさんあるけど、やっぱりこれにする。There are a lot of other good things, but as I thought, I'll go with this one.Here is 他 a noun, adjective or an adverb I would think adjective, but then why the に？ Because 他 is a の (as opposed to な）adjective then the conjugation　to change to an adverb should be "他く" not "他に".  However, 他 (ほか) does not end in い　so I'm thoroughly confused as to how 他 conjugates as an adverb.Can someone please explain to me what 他 is and why we use 他にいいもの　as opposed to 他いいもの or 他のいいもの to express "good things"
If you wanted to say. 'Keiko said xxx,' why is けいこさんが「ｘｘｘ」と言っていました better than  けいこさんが「ｘｘｘ」と言いましたThank you, and happy new year!(Also is は better than が in this instance)
I'm playing a video game and in this scene the character is on a hill and says:このまま昼寝しちまおうかMy guess is that it's a conjugation of する but it doesn't look close to する at all.What conjugations are present in that word and how does it affect the sentence's overall meaning
Can anyone explain this use of もし I thought it had to come before ～たら or ～えば.もしテレビで観たという方、ぜひぜひツイッターで教えてください。
My question is about this sentence:我が社の商品は値段を上げません。(wagasha no shouhin wa nedan wo agemasen)At first I thought there was a typo ("wagasha wa shouhin no nedan wo agemasen" or something like "wagasha no shouhin wa nedan ga agarimasen/ageraremasen"), but I was reassured this is not the case by two 先生 of mine.That は would actually be a の, but it's changed to は to add emphasis. So it's not a topic-は, it's more a contrastive-は()... or so I thought, because I've never heard of an emphatic-は (please don't confuse "focus" (集点) with "emphasis" (強調), which is a different thing).Moreover, even if the one in the sentence is not a topic-は, I can't have one at all in this sentence (while I can have a topic-は and as much contrastive-は as I want). Specifically I've been told I can't put in wareware wa as a topic:我々は、我が社の商品は値段を上げません。However it's grammatically correct to think the subject is "wareware ga"...我が社の商品は我々が値段を上げません。...but I won't ever find a sentence like this.I've studied this topic (は と が) really hard and never came across something like this. The explanation I've received is seriously lacking: it's more or less what you can expect of a native speaker (who knows what sounds right, but can't tell you why) so I ask you. Is it true that not just が and を can be replaced by は, but also のCan you give me more examples and help me to reason this outEvery answer will be very much appreciated
The entry for WWWJDIC lists 飯場 as a possibly sensitive word (sens). However, the definition is justconstruction camp; bunkhouse; workers' living quartersand it appears in 燃え尽きた地図, a novel from 1967, without any particular prejudice attached (in the description of a construction site). What's going on with this word
In English, programming projects (and large systematic projects in general) typically take their descriptive cues from well-known manufacturing/construction industry jargon, i.e. "blueprint", "assembly", "infrastructure", "building", "attaching", "extending"...the list goes on, but the essential metaphor is one of a physical structure like a building or vehicle.From what I've looked at in WWWJDIC, the nuance doesn't seem to line up exactly (not that WWWJDIC spends much space on describing nuance)--if I want to say, "construction of/building the system component", reaching from the dictionary, I have to make a choice from among 建築、造作、構築、建設、建てる（の）, among many others. On the other hand, none of these entries contain clues as to whether or not I'm even barking up the right tree.So the question is, what is the core metaphor for (programming) project development, and what kind of word choice am I looking for when I want to express a sentence like the above
良しとしましょうI'm confused. What that mean
これだから女ってやつは移ろいやすいったらねえ。"That's why girls are so variable". I guess.What about ったらねえ I found that ったら you can use when you tired of repeating yourself or when you are exasperated with somebody for not listening to you. So what would ったらねえ mean
I understand that つきあう means "to hang out with, to date, to keep company…". I've seen it used both with と and with に, but I haven't been able to figure out when to use which. So for example, what's the difference in meaning between彼とつきあう and彼につきあう？
What are the differences in nuance between these same pronunciation prefix + different かえる combinationsFor example:置き換える・置き替える入れ替える・入れ換える・入れ変える取り替える・取り代える・取り換えるThank you very much!
I just happened across an Asahi Shinbun article with a headline that reads:日本{にほん}の子{こ}どもの幸福度{こうふくど}は６位{い}　豊{ゆた}かさの一方{いっぽう}、深刻{しんこく}な貧困{ひんこん}  (-) Compacting articles as much as possible is a standard practice in every newspaper in the world. Yet, the 3 character long "子ども" was written instead of the 2 character long "子供".(-) My understanding is that "ども" in "子供" is not 送{おく}り仮名{がな}。 If somehow it is, I hope someone can elaborate "送り仮名" does not happen after tangible nouns, rightThe writer of that headline absolutely has a reason for writing "子ども", but I cannot imagine what it is. Conserving space in a newspaper is paramount, and "子供" looks good to me.thank you.
The dictionary says that it means 'To bewitch.' Could you please give an example of it's use and when you'd use itThank you immensely!
So, 分かる is never used as 分かれる, right  Because 分かる is already a potential-form verb, according to my Japanese grammar dictionary.  About なる: can it be conjugated as なれる  Or how about ならせる  For example, 青くならせる--make it blue.  If not, how do I say things like, "Make her happy; turn this blue; make it so!"  And back to 分かる, can you say 分からせる: 'make it understood'
There are some lyrics in the song VOICE by Perfume that go:点と点を繋げてこ  everythingを合わせてこ  I've no idea how こ functions here as I don't think I've encountered it before like this.The group are from [広島]{ひろしま} if that helps, though I couldn't find anything about it on the wiki for 広島弁. It's probably something really simple.
無理難題さらっと滑り込ませるのやめてくだい.I can't understand the meaning of this sentence, someone is asking the permission to stop doing something because it's impossible to () Could you please explain me Thank you.
I cannot completely grasp the meaning されて堪らない. As far as I can understand ~てたまらない means "Really want to do, extremely.", but I'm a bit of unsere with passive voice in the following sentence.Some sort of translation:  "I want you to tell me frankly. You are clever so I understand that you are thinking thoroughly, and you absolutely cannot stop being self-sufficent(自己完結) about it."率直なところを述べてほしいね。頭のいい君のことだ、いろいろ考えているのはわかっているけど、それで自己完結されちゃあ堪らない。Context:
Im scratching my head trying to figure out grammar behind マリアさんの話を聞きたいっておっしゃってましたよ。Its from my text book, which is translated into something like want to hear his word saying about it. I knew 聞きたい = want to hear, おっしゃる = polite word for say/speak, but couldnt put them together.I guess there are some sort of contracted speech involved since the conversation is somewhat casual, but there isnt sufficient grammar guide for it in my book, nor could I google anything helpful beyond auto translation. Can anyone explain it to me and guide me roughly through this "contracted form" puzzle
Could you please give me an example of the expression '気持ちを込める' and when you would use itThank you in advance! :)
Is "着物" the most commonly used, easily understood, and unambiguous Japanese translation for the  English word "kimono" If not, what alternatives would be more suitableOne reason I'm unsure is that some English words derived from Japanese would not have themselves as their best translation in Japanese. For example, the English word "sake" would be best translated as "日本酒", rather than "酒".Another reason I'm unsure is that "着物" has an etymology of "wearing thing" (equivalent to 食べ物 and 飲み物 having an etymology of "eating thing" and "drinking thing"). Can it mean "clothing" in general, for example even T-shirts Jisho.org translates the word as meaning either clothing in general, or kimono (or other Japanese style clothing).I have heard of the word "和服". Does that mean "Japanese style clothing" Would it include things other than kimonos such as yukatas
When written as a standalone kanji, the following metals have longer, "full" names (based on their colour):[金]{こがね}　→　こがね[銀]{しろがね}　→　しろがね[銅]{あかがね}　→　あかがね[鉄]{くろがね}　→　くろがねIn my Japanese Bible, there are various places where they appear in lists of materials, etc.  I rather prefer to read them by these full names, but I don't know if that is correct or not.  Are these full names ever used in modern Japanese  If so, in what kind of situations are they read this way
When is it okay to have more than one は in a sentence I've come across a few examples where there have been more than one は, and hadn't why.Example:日本語は色々なスピーチスタイルがあることは知っていますね。Thank you!
I have a little question.オマエは歩くのが遅ェからに決まってんだろ！  グズグズしてる暇はねえんだよ！My question is about the first sentence. I guess it must be translated like: "You're walking slow! And we have no time to lose!" I'm not sure, but からに is confusing me. What can that mean in this sentence
I often see 浮く in contexts relating to floatability, like:氷は水に浮きますHowever, sometimes I see 浮く used where I'd use 浮かぶ.When should one be used over the otherAre there any cases where both are acceptable
In my writing class, I was surprised to learn that ポイント can be used to mean パーセント in graphs. In English, we don't normally call percentage points just points. Does anyone have any background / insight as to when/where ポイント can be used in Japanese
I am newly learning Japanese , so I whenever I encounter a new Kanji I search for it on jisho.org , but then I find that there are given Japanese Kun Japanese on andJapanese names .

The verb for change is かえる。 Which kanji is used for changing a TV channelWhich kanji should be used, and whyEven native Japanese websites appear confused.Is it:　返る・変える・替える・換える？I must be hanging around the wrong Japanese people. Even they don't seem sure!!
Is ありす, or a name pronounced the same as "ありす", a traditional feminine given name (If I have to define traditional, then pre-dating the end of the Sakoku policy)I've heard about parents naming their girls ありす because they like the foreign name "Alice", but does the name actually pre-date the event of Japanese knowing the word "Alice"
I just want to ask how people get over the vagueness of description in this language. Let me explain. Today I saw my friend say "これを見た電車の中で..." and I was just wondering... how do you deal with the lack of connecting words as are in English.We would say "In the train IN WHICH/WHERE I watched this..." and as you can see, we have words for joining. I'm not saying our method is more correct I am saying I don't understand their method. Doesn't it get confusing when people start talking fast or with lots of pausesHow do you differentiate "これを見た。電車の中で...”　From "これを見た電車の中で”.If it is a thing you just have to get used to, can I have some advice of how to practice it or understand it better
The following sentence is from a formal conversation. The student is talking to a teacher.実は日本語のクラスでプロジェクトワークをしていまして、私は日本の歴史の教科書をトピックに選びました。Can someone explain to me the exact meaning of "教科書をトピックに選びました" Literally translated it appears that he "chose a textbook", but that seems like a strange thing to say, since students don't normally choose their own textbooks (no other context about the project work is given). As an adverb, I'm not sure what トピックに could mean.Alternately, could it be an equivalent of 教科書をトピックにする, i.e. "make the textbook into the topic" of the project Is it common to replace にする with other verbs such as に選ぶ, if this is the case

I was reading a short text on Aozora:お星さま  小川未明澄{すみ}ちゃん、澄{すみ}ちゃん、なにあげよう。  あのお星{ほし}さま、とっておくれ。  あんまり高{たか}くて、とれません。  そんなら、あたいがとってみよう。  お星{ほし}さま、お星{ほし}さま、なにあげよう。  のどがかわいた、水{みず}おくれ。  あんまり遠{とお}くて、いかれません。  そんなら、わたしが下{お}りていこう。  I found the phrase あたいがとってみよう。 I suppose the original expression must be あたいがとる。My question is about とる.  Isn't it a transitive verb  It doesn't make sense to me in this expression.  Please help me understand the meaning of the expression.
The sentence below is from an essay. I'm confused about the grammatical components of "夫の働きいいように" ("to make the husband's work easy") — shouldn't there be a が just after 働き, or is it being casually omitted Usually が isn't the type of particle to be casually omitted, and this is a professionally written essay. Or am I understanding the whole structure wrong子どもを産み、育て、家事をやり、夫の働きいいようにとりしきるのが主婦でした。
Quick basic grammar question.With respect to expressing ownership of an item using ある.  Am I correctly understanding the general meaning and particle use in the following sentences 私の辞書がありません　→　I do not have MY dictionary私は辞書がありません　→　I do not have a dictionaryI think the second example makes sense grammatically speaking, however I'm unsure if the first example is correct.  Can I use の in similar situations like this to express if a particular item belongs to me Can I use it like this with いる as well For example:私の子供がいます　→　The child is mine私は子供がいます　→　I have a childThanks!Matt

And on their off time they make charcoal and sell it in town, because their farms are only small and don't make any money. So after they sell their charcoal, they go to the izakaya and.... I don't understand after that.
How can I translate "楽にして"  I read it change if transitive or intransitive...The sentence was: 私が楽にしてやろう！ the context is: a guy asks to another about "being friends", but the other doesn't accept, the other guy is evil. The evil guy says that sentence before starting to control the good guy's mind.can be "I'll make it easy (to you become my friend)"
I came across a sentence I don't understand. The essay it's from has a feminist theme about the roles of women in Japan. It's the second sentence below:それは尊敬すべき努力ですが、主婦はすべてそうするべきだというのには、賛成できません。　男が時代の進歩を理解しないのを、そのままにしているからです。What I'm guessing is "That's because women keep the status quo of men failing to grasp the social progress of time."What is the exact meaning of そのままにする, and what is the role of its object marked by を Who is the subject performing the action of そのままにする in that sentence
I read that だんだん is more used in casual conversation, but is there any difference in meaning
Hi^^ I'm studying the usage of せい and せいで, and it says (I'm using "Dictionary of Intermediate Japanese Grammar" as main reference) that it cannot be used to express a reason :1)宿題がたくさんある　*せいで　パーティに行けない。  2)誰も手伝ってくれない　*せいで　一人でやらなければならない。(in both cases it uses から・ので・ために)I'm not clear on these sentences: can't we consider the presence of a lot of homework as a cause for not having time [or is it related to the fact that maybe homework are a "controllable" thing ]what is the difference between n°2 and, say, 私のせいで作業が遅れてしまった。[other than the past tense]I would really appreciate if you could also give me some other examples of sentences where I can't use it. Thank you in advance.

What is the connection between eyes and boundaries (the etymology of those phrases)
お前も私も一人にせず、且つお前に 少しの 罰を 与える 方法を考えてみた。In this phrase I've some doubt about "一人にせず". Using google, I can translate it as "not alone". But I read "せず" is a negative form of "する” and indicate that one action took place without or in the absence of another action. But... It seems senseless.
I am having high confusion between katakana n ン and katakana so ソ. They look very similar even with the different stroke directions, they look very similar. Could anyone suggest how to differentiate between them
Kenkyuusha defines 買｛か｝い食｛ぐ｝い as:spend one's pocket money on candyand Daijirin defines it as:（主に子供が）菓子などを自分で買って食べること。Both of these identify 買い食い as being related to candy/sweets. Is the term given this definition just because a child, left to its own devices, would be likely to go and buy sweet rather than other things Or, would it actually be unnatural to say something like あの子がたこ焼きを買い食いした (たこ焼き being neither a candy nor a sweet)

The sentence is現代ほど自分の主体性、価値観を築き上げるのに難しい時代はないのである。If I understand correctly, the sentence can be simplified to現代ほど難しい時代はない (There is no time period as difficult as now)The entire sentence tells you that the difficult thing is building one's own independence and values, but I don't understand how the のに is supposed to fit grammatically in there. My best guess is that the middle part is somehow an adverb modifying 難しい.

I was once told that haiku should be "padded" so that instead of 5/7/5, they fit an 8/8/8 meter:■■■■■□□□　←　wait for 3 beats after this line  ■■■■■■■□　←　wait for 1 beat after this line  ■■■■■□□□　←　wait for 3 beats after this line  If I recall correctly, the explanation was that Japanese favors rhythms in groups of 4 or 8 beats (morae).  I don't actually know if haiku are read this way, though--it's just something I was told once.Are haiku actually read aloud with these pauses  Or is this something my friend made up
To literally translate "hieroglyphic", when referring to a largely logographic writing system used by Ancient Egyptians, I think ヒエログリフ or something similar would be used.However, there's another, metaphorical, meaning in English to the term "hieroglyphic", which is writing that's hard to understand, possibly because it's too advanced for the person reading it as opposed to it being sloppily written. (Meaning 3 in English wiktionary)Are there any terms in Japanese that use metaphor to convey this metaphorical meaning
In the textbook "Japanese For Busy People I" (which uses only kana, not kanji), on page 161, there is the following sentence.ごぜん １０じから ごご ３じまでです。かいぎの あとで さっぽろししゃに いって、さとうさんに あいます。Using kanji, I think it would look like this:午前１０時から午後３時までです。会議の後で札幌支社に行って、佐藤さんに会います。However, a native Japanese speaker is suggesting I drop the "で" after the "の後" from the following sentence (I think to make it more natural):チェックインの後で、衣料品店に行きました。Is having a "で" rather formal and textbook-ish Japanese
I found this in a phrase: 隠れていなくて.I can translate it simply as "aren't hiding" or "were hiding"By the way, is it correct or is 隠れていません betterBy the way, the whole phrase isお前はやはり私のような強いものの後ろに隠れていなくてはな。
I'm very sorry, I just couldn't figure it out. If you could state what grammar pieces the term uses and how they affect the word, that would be great.So far I know that the 会えなくて is the te form of negative '出来る' form.Sorry!
With an action verb, like 食べる, I can count 5 meanings of this sentence:ジョンは納豆を食べている  "John is eating natto." (progressive)  "John is eating the natto." (progressive)  "John eats natto." (habitual)   "John has eaten natto." (perfective: experience)   "John has eaten the natto." (perfective: state of having eaten the natto)To me, the last two readings are possible, but kind of odd.However, you can completely force the experience reading:ジョンは前に納豆を食べている  "John has eaten natto before." (perfective: experience)And you can almost force reading 5:ジョンは例の納豆を食べている  "John is eating that natto which we just saw." (progressive)  "John has eaten that natto which we just saw." (perfective: state of having eaten the natto)Finally, if you use 〜ていない instead, I think all the readings are equally likely:ジョンは納豆を食べていない  "John is not eating natto." (progressive)  "John is not eating the natto." (progressive)  "John does not eat natto." (habitual)  "John has not eaten natto." (perfective: experience)  "John has not eaten the natto." (perfective: state of not having eaten the natto)In my opinion, the perfective readings here are equally or more likely than the other readings. They become even more likely if you insert まだ, for example.(I guess, etymologically-speaking, it is not too surprising that 〜ている can have the perfective semantics, given that て was the 連用形 of the perfective auxiliary verb つ.)Some of the meanings come from whether 納豆 is being talked about in general, or a specific serving of 納豆 is being discussed, but the reason why I included all of them is because the actual implications of the different perfective readings are entirely different for the two different cases (as in English).Is what I've laid out here entirely correct Are the perfective readings actually less likely for the simple 〜ている case like I think they are

I'm looking at this picture of the 日米和親条約 (Kanagawa convention) from the late Edo period and it seems rather strange:It looks like the non-kanji parts are rather haphazardly written in katakana and hiragana. For example, the first part: 全権 ニテユカル ペレトペルリ を . And the next page, 日本と合衆国と ハ 其人民...Is there some sort of rules behind this, or is it just stylistic choices by the person in question It does seem that Japanese orthography wasn't really standardized until the Meiji period (in which official documents seem to be written in a weird constrained Classical Japanese with 濁点 omitted, but I'll ask that as another question), but this random usage of katakana and hiragana, well I've haven't seen it before. I thought a text usually used either katakana or hiragana for its non-kanji parts.

My book says that "koto" can convert verbs into nouns.  It can also convert adjectives and adverbial nouns, but what does that mean  It gives examples like:Tori o tsukamaeru koto wa kantan ja naiWatashi wa kare ga nihon e itta koto o nd dare date boku ga atama ga warui koto ot shitteruThe book says "koto" means "thing", "fact", or "matter".How exactly do you use "koto"
I've searched around and I've only found the usage of へ as being a particle meaning "in the direction of..." I'm not sure what it means as an interjectional question.Context:Girl: ねえ      三島さんが      具合悪いみたいなの      保健室連れていくねMishima: へGirl: うんわかったー      先生にいっておくねSince the particle へ deals with direction, would the question be something like "This way" or "In this direction"
In the game Okami, the demon Yamata no Orochi is written here, and also in a separate game here as ヤマタノオロチ, not やまたのおろち. Even the particle の is in katakana. I'm curious as to why this is. I know that it derives from a Japanese legend of Yamata no Orochi, so why is it written in katakana
My understanding is that 「学習{がくしゅう}」 is a very interesting word. It has all of the following meanings(1) 「勉強{べんきょう}」. To study new material.We learn new kanji, vocab, grammar, etc.(2) 「練習{れんしゅう}」. To review already learned material.We perform drills to keep already studied kanji remembered.(3) 「研究{けんきゅう}」. To research the origins of the material being studied.As opposed to studying how to speak/write Japanese, we research etymologies, etc.(question #1) Can I substitute 学習 for 勉強、or for 練習、or for 研究(question #2): If I want to specify all of 勉強、練習、and 研究、can I just say 学習 (acting as a superset of those 3 items)  thank you.
In "The Matrix Revolutions", at the final showdown, there's a brief exchange:Smith: アンダーソン君　お帰り  Smith: 会いたかった  Neo:　今夜が最後だThat's what the subtitles say, anyway.  The dub is almost identical for Smith (he adds "君に" at the start of the second line), but Neo says something different that I don't recognize.  It sounds like: "今夜 けりがつく" ().I'm assuming that what Neo says is equivalent in meaning to "最後だ", but I don't know anything like that that sounds like what he says.(If this doesn't sound familiar to anyone, I can try recording the audio.)

Let's use できる as an example.できる (I) can do (it)/possible (action/event).できるか Can do/Possibleできますか Can do/Possible (polite)Believe it or not, できますか still sounds too direct to me.Now here's my question, is this dekimasuka:(もし)できますでしょうか Possibly can do/Perhaps possibleand(もし)できませんでしょうか Can't (you) possibly do/Isn't it perhaps possibleIf the above statements are grammatically sound, how about natively When a native person hears it, what is their average response to such a statement/questionAnother related question: according to some teachers of Japanese, the か at the end of a question could be considered harsh, too direct or unnecessary. For example, what is the difference (if any) between [たべる] (with question mark) and [たべるか] (with question mark and か)Optional question: Where does だろうか and でありますか/でありませんか fit into all of this
Ok, so I'm still trying to get used to the に particle and how it has many functions that make it easy for it to appear many times in a sentence and thus get confusing...But I am specifically looking at its function in these two sentences:１・お土産にチョコレートをもらった。２・先生に友達を紹介した。 Doesn't that get confusingLike, if the first example can be interpreted as "I received chocolate　as an omiyage"  doesn't that mean the second example can be interpreted as "I introduced my friend as a teacher (As in you said "This is my friend who is a teacher")"How do you reconcile this If I wanted to say that I introduced my friend AS a teacher how do you do this
I originally asked in the chatroom which out of the two phrases is better:PlaceにThingがありますか？orThingがPlaceにありますか？If anyone can translate these to make them relevant in English, it would be welcomed by all means.Darius Jahandarie suggested some examples to make sense of what I'm talking about:学校{がっこう}に子供{こども}たちがいますか？VS子供{こども}たちが/は学校{がっこう}にいますか？As well as:ロンドンに山{やま}がありますか？VS山{やま}がロンドンにありますか？Is there anyone who can explain the difference, and possibly where the appropriate place to use both of them is
I need help with a very easy sentence that for some reason I just can't seem to get right. I hate when this happens.I'll be visiting Osaka next week and I can't think of a natural sounding way to tell a friend "By the way, I'll be in Osaka next week for a few days so let's go grab a drink or something."ところで、来週は数日間大阪へ行くことになったから、よかったら飲みでもに行こうか？I know this would get the meaning across but I need to know what's the most normal/natural sounding way to say it. I've known this person for quite some time now so feel free to use conversational Japanese.
I have this line in my book:かいしゃのりょうはふるいです。  I understand the whole sentence except for りょう.  When I googled it, it says it mean "Ryo". So I googled かいしゃのりょう and I got "Ryo Company".  What does りょう mean
In many love songs, the singer calls their partner 君 (きみ).But is this used by couples in real life, as of 2013Should this word be considered obsolete, or is it still seeing some use outside of the pop worldNote: I have heard きみ used in conversations between junior/senior, but here I am referring specifically to couples.
I came across this sentence:[意気地]{いくじ}なし！そして全くその通りで私はあったのだ。  "Coward! And that was, in fact, exactly what I was."(From 苦の世界, my translation.)I found in pretty weird that 私は dropped in the middle of である like that, when you would normally only see は, も, or another 係助詞.My feeling is that this is just a "freer" writing style that kind of breaks the rule there to make the sentence more dramatic -- is this understanding correct
I have the following translation.名古屋市内に入ると、工事中で、一方通行が多くて、曲がりたくてもまっすぐ行かなければなりませんでした。The following is what I have so far.When I arrived inside the City of Nagoyait was under construction andthere was a lot of 1 way traffic and... I had to go straight. I think 曲がりたくて is the te-form of 曲がりたい (I want to turn). But I am not sure how the following も connects it to the second part of the sentence. The only te-form + も structure we've learned is permission (followed by いいですか or something similar).

My problem is the 泳ぎたがっている. I think it means she is wanting to swim, but I would expect that to be written as follows.泳ぐ - I swim泳ぎたい - I want to swim泳ぎたくている - I am wanting to swimSo I don't understand why it's がって instead of くて. I thought the たい form was considered an i-adjective. And I can't think of any way to get the て form used in the sentence.

For the second sentence,  have more issues. Do you think that ... easy/lenient romantic Japanese man existsI am not sure what the こんな means (na-adjective variation of この). And I am also not sure of the translation as a whole. Is いる just acting as です Or maybe they're talking about Japanese men exist who are romanticThanks for any help.

Quick question about some so-called "adverbs". I've seen some people claim that noun + に particle (本当に) isn't really an adverb. If it isn't an adverb, then does anyone know what the function of the に particle is here I've seen monolingual dictionaries say that these are adverbs, but then there are people claiming that they are only called adverbs in textbooks to simplify things for English speakers. Both seem plausible - which is true

I have the following translation for class.旅館には、外国人がたくさんいて、アメリカから来たテッドさんという人が、息子に英語の話し方を教えてくれたので、そのおれいに、車で、神社に連れて行ってあげることにしました。I am having trouble figuring out who goes along with what parts of the sentence. The first line I think I am fine with.In the Japanese-style inn, there were a lot of people and...The second line I am also pretty confident about.a person called Ted-san who came from America...The third line is where I start having an issue. I thought ...てくれる was only used when someone was giving/doing something for you (the speaker). Is this not the case I feel like I want to assign it to the son, and make it the following. But I am not sure. taught my son how to speak English so...The fourth line the only issue I have is knowing what そのおれいに means. I know その marks "that" and に is a particle. I looked up おれい and find "thank you". So "to that thank you" I am guessing it's the following. But not sure how it comes together.to thank him for that, I decided to take him to a shrine in our car.So my questions are.When can ...てくれる be directed towards someone other than the speakerHow does そのおれいに transfer to EnglishThanks :)
Where does ずっこけ come from It doesn't have kanji, but it also isn't repetitive like onomatopoeia-so does it just not use the kanji anymore, or does it have strange roots
すごく背が低いけれど、いつも堂々とした態度で、颯爽とした雰囲気がある。そして――‥‥彼女は僕の彼女だったりする。What exactly is the meaning of "だったりする" here I've read in A Dictionary of Basic Japanese Grammar by Seiichi Makino that when たり is used with adjectives and nouns, it means "sometimes". Accordingly, when I first read the above line, I understood the part in question as "She is sometimes my girlfriend(and sometimes not)". Is that the correct interpretation From context, it doesn't feel like it is so. Is there another way of understanding "だったりする"
I have seen と used in the following manner.公園に田中さんと行きました - I went to the park with Tanaka-sanAnd I have seen で used as follows. 公園に二人で行きました - I went to the part with 1 other person (2 people including me)But now I have the following sentence.家族で旅行に行ってきました - I went traveling with my familyWould it have been appropriate to use either と or で in this situation Or is there a reason で was used I am thinking maybe the use of で indicates you are in the group you're going with and と indicates you are not a part of the group. Is that what's going on
I sometimes see moving or directional verbs doubled up, with the first verb in て form. I think my professor mentioned that this just sometimes happens but means the same as if you didn't have the second verb. So essentially the following 2 sentences are the same (both meaning I went traveling). 旅行に行きました旅行に行って来ましたBut is there any nuance difference between the 2I might also be wrong. Something tells me this might mean I went traveling and was still there.
so, consider the following conversation:「その日本酒、どう？」  「うん、わるくない。ちょっと甘い」  「本当？飲んでみる...　げっ！全然甘くないよ！  「まあ、it's sweet, for sake　  Essentially I'm trying to say that something is not sweet in absolute terms, but is sweet relative to other members of the indicated category. Other examples might be "It's slow for a motorbike" or "It's gentle, for a roller coaster."The best I could come up with was 「ほかの日本酒と比べたら、あまい」which gets the meaning across, but feels a bit clunky to me.
I have to translate the following for my intro Japanese class.私は、去年、名古屋市内の静かな所にある庭つきの三階建ての窓の大きい住みやすい家を買いました。I think it means the following.Last year, I bought a yard/garden including, 3 story, large window, easy to live inhouse which is in a quiet place inside the City of Nagoya.However, I feel like there are のs in weird places. First の - I can rationalize this as the interior of the City of Nagoya "owning" the place.Second の - Not really sure on this one. Maybe it's just part of the garden "attached" structureThird and forth の - These I REALLY don't understand. How they work in conjunction with the 窓. I think it's the windows that are big. But maybe it's the house and the house just has regular windows I just don't know. Can someone explain to me what all these のs are doing Thank you :)
While the meaning of 代える　seems rather straightforward, the other two at times delude me.When should one be used over another Are there any situations where both 換える and 替える are applicable
So we know that we can qualify/equate two things with a の.友達のジョン　→　My friend John先生の山田さん　→　A/My teacher Ms. Yamada勝利者の亀さん　→　The winner:  the turtle (as opposed to the hare)It seems like most of the time, the の can be replaced with である without any change in meaning.  Or is there some nuance where the meaning changes slightly  With 先生の山田さん, to me it has more of the sense of my teacher, whereas 先生である山田さん definitely does not.  Does the である necessarily diminish the personal-ness of the qualification, or does it just depend on what you happen to be talking aboutFurther, we can go on to include the なる connector as I discuss somewhat in this topic (“Grammatically-correct” particle-less phrases/sayings).  なる appears to add a little more formality, but other than that I can't really see what else it brings to the table.  For example, in my Japanese Bible, I've seen the following when referring to God:父なる神様　→　God the/our Father; Father God神なる主【しゅ】　→　Our Lord GodIf I recall correctly, these were both instances (although appearing multiple times in the whole Bible) where someone was referring to God while speaking to other people.  Is this likely just due to a different writing style by different Biblical authors, or is there really some subtle difference in meaningFinally, there is たる which seems to be the most formal (), most archaic (), and mostly literary ().  Again, all I can tell is that I usually see this paired with some kind of recommendation / moral suggestion / responsibility.教師たる者、忍耐力がなくてはならない　→　All teachers must have patience学生たるもの、勉強すべきである　→　All students should studyObviously if the meaning changes completely they are not interchangeable.(社長たる道　=　社長の道)　≠　社長である道　≠　社長なる道    Doesn't work because we're showing a possessive with the の, not equating.So at what times are these connectors interchangeable, and what nuance(s) does each bring  Is my reasoning correct in any of these areas
I want to know if there is a rule or way of thinking that makes it easier to understand which adjectives can be used in the following pattern.体にいいです。健康にわるいです。酒によわいです。電車に詳しいです。その場にふさわしかった。I tried using 子供に怖い and it was unacceptable, so I wish to know, what is the general relationship between the noun and the adjective and how do you know in what sense to use them and which adjectives it works with.Can you explain using more examples Please be as verbose as possible as I cannot find ANYTHING about it on the internet or in any textbooks despite copious amounts of searching.Random ideas:Is it related to:お金がないのに・・・おみやげにチョコをもらった。
Both 店 and ショップ translate into English as "shop". For which circumstances would you use each wordMy first assumption was that 店 would be used for more "traditional" shops than ショップ, but when I did a google image search of 店, one of the hits was for Mos Burger.
I often hear "あせた" as in:パスワードわかんなくてあせた  作れなくてあせたわ  久々すぎて全然できなくてあせたIs it only oral usageHow should I write it in an emailDoes it make sense to ever spell it with kanjiI always hear it as "あせた", can it be used in other tenses as well
The verbs つつむ and くるむ and both written 包む, and according to my English-to-Japanese dictionary both have the meaning "to wrap". くるむ is glossed "おおう", while つつむ is glossed "すっぽりと覆う", but I am having difficulty distinguishing the two from these definitions and from the example sentences provided. Is there a difference in usage between the two words, or can they be treated as synonyms
I've been learning my hiragana from here:http://yosida.com/en/hiragana.htmlFor the characters fu, mu, mo, na, ra, yu, and ya, I see a discrepancy between what's in the little box and what shows up when you click the character to see it being drawn. For these characters, the little boxes show several strokes seemingly connected in smooth lines, while the drawings will show strongly separated marks.Which "style" -- if that's the appropriate word -- is preferable
怒りで単純になったお前の攻撃を     私が避けられないとでも？I really didn't understand this sentence.Why is there that space between "を"and "私"I'm not sure, but the whole thing is like:"Because your anger, it was simple for me don't avoid your attack"
This question already has answers here:                                            Distinguishing certain characters in handwriting and print (Similar-looking Kana and Kanji)                                (4 answers)                            Closed 6 years ago.The first is supposed to be the kanji for mouth, "くち" and the sencond is supposed to be katakana. When I typed them in google translate, the sizes were different so I could differentiate them that way, but now just like in the title, they look exactly the same. How do people tell the diffence when reading
お前に私が殺せると思ってるのか？I'm not sure about this phrase.Is correct "お前に" or it's better "お前を". Is object or agentAnd which person is correct for 思ってる "お前" or "私"It's a line from a comic I'm trying to translate and there is a person who attack another and the other after avoiding the attack says this phrase.I translated (probably wrong, I know) both:"Do you think to kill me" (I think it's wrong)"I'm thinking to kill you, do you know" (I'm not sure how to translate "のか？")

I was wondering how would you express pausing to think in Japanese. So for example in English it would be said as "hmmmm...".I believe あのう。。。 can be used but are there any more ways to do soI hope my question is clear.
Can へ mean "and" In Chinese 和 means "and" and is read "he", so I'm just hopeful... I don't mean in the present necessarily, just at any point in the language's history. I know へ is used as a direction marker... just wondering if there was another use.
I'm trying to translate this text from a comic. I understood words, but the whole speech is difficult.自分を理解してくれる者がいるというのは 心地よいものだよ。。。一人というのは寂しかっただろう？私もかつては自分を理解する者がいない 孤独に苛まれたよ。I translated something like: It's  beautiful to have someone who understand you(rself).A lone person is a solitary, do you agreeOnce I didn't understand my self too and was tormented by loneliness. (Or tormented myself into loneliness).First phrase with that "者" and "というのは" was really a problem @.@
I have trouble understanding the second and the last paragraphs from this short text.I just couldn't parse the second paragraph at all. And the only thing I can glean from the fourth paragraph is that "It's more efficient to treat city and prefecture library as a fall-back option" but this is incomplete and probably wrong too. A detailed explanation would be much appreciated.
I'm having trouble to understand もこれで in a sentence.This is the sentence with もこれで:たったひとり、命がけのしゅぎょうもこれで最後だ.I will translate this by:"this is the conclusion of a solitary life-or-death training." I don't understand which meaning to give to "もこれで". I don't know which additional information it brings.Could someone help me thank you
On Denshi Jisho looking up "おとこのこ"　brings up two results:男の子 and 男のコEdit: (child not boy)I read the first one literally as "Male [possesive] child" or "Male's child" (or maybe の here is not a particle, just part of the word).  The second one is strange.  They have the same definition.  Why do we have a Katakana コ　here
Whether a noun is [サ変名詞]{さへんめいし}, or not, is an attribute that is specified in the dictionary definition of nouns."Possible to use 美化語{びかご}" surely should be an attribute of a noun But, I do not see this attribute specified in dictionary definitions.Is there a list of the nouns that can possibly use 美化語If not, you just have to use "feel" for where to use 美化語Is it grammatically wrong to place 美化語 where it should not be
The line I first saw it in is:大げさなジェスチャーは小さいころからのクセだ。見てるぶんには面白いので俺はあえて注意しない。A few other examples I've found:"遠目で見ている分にはいいけれど""見てるぶんには可愛いけど…こびとづかんになりたくはない。""Paris Photo [caption on photo of antiques on display]: 見てる分にはかわいい"What does this construction (見ている分には) mean exactly In a dictionary I've read, 分 has as one of its meanings "just as much as" and "in proportion to". So would 見ている分には mean "as much as (I'm) seeing" or something along those lines Would "見てるぶんには面白いので" mean "It's interesting as much as I'm seeing it,so..." That doesn't make much sense, though. Can someone enlighten me [Edit:On second thought, maybe it's more something like: "To the degree that I'm watching, because it's interesting, I don't go so far as to pay attention" or "I don't at all pay attention to the degree that I'm watching because it's amusing."]
I have to translate the following for my intro Japanese class.父は、少し、働きすぎなので、庭の花や木に水でもやって、リラックスした方がいいとおもいます。I understand parts of the sentence, but not the sentence as a whole.I think 父は、少し、働きすぎなので is My father works a little too much so. But, I don't understand why it's すぎな and not すぎる.I think 庭の花や木に水でもやって is Someone gives water even to the garden flower and the tree (etc). I am not sure how the "even" should be though.Finally, I think リラックスした方がいいとおもいます is I think it is better if he relaxes.So my questions are Why the な instead of a る on the first partHow is the even placed in the second partHow do all three parts form a logical sentenceMy best guess is My father works a little too hard so, since someone even gives water to the garden flower and the tree (etc), I think it is better if he relaxes.
This is an example from an iPhone app called Tae Kim's learning Japanese:子供だったアリスが立派な大人になった。- The Alice that was a child became a fine adult.The part "fine adult" or "立派な大人" confuses me.  The "な" between 立派 and 大人, what is it  A particle, part of the word 立派 or what
The most common translation I see of バイト I see is "part-time work". However, the contexts I see it used in seem to refer to casual work, as opposed to people having a permanent job, merely with reduced hours, such as women with young children (does this scenario not occur in Japan).Is "part-time work" a more accurate translation of バイト than "casual work"
I want to say "what kind of evening are you having".  I think 何で can be used, but I dont know how to fit evening into the sentence structure.  I have:何でイブニングがあるか？Is this right  Would the sentence structure be similar in general"What kind of X do you have"
Let's take  文  kanji for example:I can find words for its most popular readings -　もん、ぶん、ふみ：文字、文化、文、文人【ふみひと】But here  it says there are two other readings -  あや and  かざる - but i can't find words for them!! (google, wiktionary, jisho.org do not help!)Or kanji  局 - wiktionary mentions this reading  しきる But where is it used that wayThe question is  How can i find words for these less popular readings
This is dialogue from a book I have, where a doctor is talking about a patient:気分が極端に変りやすくなっていて、自分で自分をコントロールできない。神を呪うかと思うと、神に祈る。呪う自分と祈る自分と、絶えず入れ替っていて、どっちが本当の自分か判断できないでいる。My question is about the way the final verb is conjugated. I am familiar with the ている form for verbs that are not negated, like 「できている」, and I've also seen cases where でいる seems to be used similar to the copula である, for example 「好きでいる」.In this sentence, is できないでいる just simply できない in the ている form (using できないで rather than できなくて) Is there any connection with things such as 好きでいる, or is that different
In Monkey Majik's song "Change" they say "Time to Party 十二本の腕", what does 十二本の腕 means Isn't it just 12, counter for long objects, arms Why would this be applicable
I have just started learning hiragana, and am confused about the pronunciation of some of them. I have heard some pronunciation guides for け which say it should sound like kay, and some which say it should just be ke (with an e sound like the one found at the start of the English word edge), and some for か say it should be kar, while others are telling me it should be ka (like the a sound at the beginning of apple). Can I have some verification as to which of these is correct, apologies if the question is deemed too basic.EDIT:Apparently both sets of guides are incorrect, as they try and put the sounds into terms of English pronunciation. This being the case, can someone link me to a guide that explains how to properly pronounce them
I'm sure someone asked a similar question but I did a search and couldn't find any. Usually I just translate everything into but, but (no pun intended) I think it's about time I got into the nitty gritty of the buts, similar to the different kinds of "thanks" and the different kinds of "sorrys". So here is an exhaustive list of buts.Off the top of my head, here are the different types of buts I can recall and the basics of what I already know. If you can add to the list, please do so.Sentence-initial buts (used at the beginning of the sentence):でも (general purpose but)しかし (sounds formal; apparently the shortened form of しかしながら)ただ (sounds formal)ただし (related to above more formal than ただ)ところが (nuance currently unknown)Phrase joining buts (used to join two phrases):が (general purpose but; in casual speech/writing where rules can be broken, が can be used in the sentence initial position instead of embedded within in sentence)けどけれどけれども (the longer it is, the more formal)Unknown buts:然{しか}るに (found from a dictionary search; I personally have never seen it before today)In explaining the differences, please, where possible, also consider whether a particular but leans more towards casual speech or formal speech, and whether it appears more in writing, or in speech, or both.
(1) ”元気なの” and "調子はどうだい？" are pretty much equivalent in meaning and formality, right The ”元気なの” being a little feminine because of the "なの" And, "調子はどうだい？" is rarely / never used by native speakers I don't think I've ever heard it used.  (2) "調子はどうだい？" is just an informal way to say "調子はどうですか？", right  (3) Can I up the formality of 「調子はどうですか？」 Perhaps:"ご調子は、どうですか？""ご調子は、いかがですか？" // &lt;--- best"ご調子は、おいかがですか？""ご調子は、どうなさっていますか？"(4) When I am greeting someone in a business setting, can I pop-off a:"ご調子は、いかがですか？"and not have the native speaker think that I sound weird Rather, I'd want him/her to think I sound different, but not weird.thanks.
Wiktionary more or less defines "Apple tax" asThe price premium paid by consumers of Apple consumer products over  comparable devices from competitors.Is there an equivalent term in Japanese for "Apple tax" (or other mock taxes, such as a wedding tax for increased costs of items when they're associated with a wedding) If so, what is itI tried Wiktionary and jisho.org without any luck.
あら as in the expression of surprise like "oh my".
Just a straightforward question but why is しゃべる considered intransitive when I've seen it used on direct objects.  Example from jisho.org: 私は英語を喋ることができる。Is there something I'm missing
I came across this word (ぶえっくしょ) recently and tried looking it up on every site I knew. I assume it's slang. The line in which I first saw it is: 「あいつだって、いつも読んでないわけじゃ………ぶえっくしょ！！」. As I was researching it, I saw it in two other forms:ぶえっくしょん and ぶえっくしょい (sometimes ぶえっくしょーん or ぶえっくしょーい). Does anyone know what this means and what it is Also, does it belong to a certain dialect
Why does 熊 have 能 in it What do the four dots mean, and what is that stroke called When I say why does it have it in it, does anyone have either a linguistic interpretation, or am interpretive definition
We are approaching the end of this semester at my school. What is a good way to say thank you to my teacher「お世話になりましてありかとうございました。」 Are there any other suggestions/additions
What would be the differences if I were to say 間違いない and 間違いなく I ask that because the 無い suffix is usually explained as equivalent to the English "there is no" or "does not exist". I've seen 無くtranslated as "without", but I haven't gotten confirmation on that. It's also taught that attaching く to adjectives makes them adverbs, Fast, quick, early = 早い and then 早く = quickly. Where on earth do 無い and 無く fit into this
Japanese dictionaries often give distinguish among meanings for homophonous words with related meanings that have different kanji representations, such as:固い・堅い・硬い (see, for example, the 大辞林 entry for these words)柔らかい・軟らかい飲む・呑む渇く・乾くMy intuition is that all three forms of かたい are really "the same word" in a native speaker's mental lexicon, and that a native speaker will choose a given representation from 固い・堅い・硬い in writing so as to provide added meaning. Is my sense correct here, or do native speakers actually regard 固い・堅い・硬い as three different words
Just a quick question on the て form, as what I am about to say isn't really made clear by textbooks. Is the tense of a verb in て form dependent on what follows for example if someone was to say 教えてあげた, would the 教えて become past tense (or completed, as at doesn't have to take place in the past) Thanks is advance.
しょうがない (See: This blog post, and Wikipedia)Like "Japanese people", I am often placed in situations where no matter how hard I try, I can't change the outcome/fate. The only thing I can do is accept it.My favored response in such a situation in English is a dejected utterance of "oh well" and/or a half-hearted shrug. Other possible rhetorical verbal responses include "can't be helped I guess" and "too bad". Situations can include the minor (It just started raining! "Oh well") and major (a hundred African children just died today because of malnourishment. "Oh well")I have collected the following possible expressions that may be Japanese counterparts of "oh well":まあいいけど仕方ないか (and its variants)まあともかくそうか...Does anyone know the difference (if any) and correct usage And any other ones
One of the definitions for the suffix 号 in 大辞林 looks like this:列車・船・飛行機・動物などの名に付けて用いる。  「ひかり―」I'm somewhat familiar with this suffix from fiction.  For example, I remember it from the anime series ふしぎの海のナディア, which had a submarine called the ノーチラス号.  And I've seen it used for other forms of transportation in fiction, too, like airships, and even a race car.But I haven't seen it used for animal names, and the definition above says it can attach to the names of 動物 as well.  Wikipedia's disambiguation page for 号 says something similar:ウマ、イヌなど、動物の名前につける接尾辞。But it doesn't say when it would be used, and I can't remember having seen any pet or animal names ending in 号.  So I'm curious: do people still use the suffix this way  If so, when would it be used
I've got two related questions:1) How do you say numbers in scientific notation in Japanese For example, 3x108 is spoken in English as "three times ten to the eight". Do negative exponents works the same as ordinary negative numbers (i.e. prefix with マイナス)2) How do you say the units For example m s-1 ("meters per second" - you get no prize for guessing why I'm asking ;) ), or more complicated examples like  kg m2 s-2 K-1 ("kilogram metres squared per second squared kelvin").
I frequently hear 「あれ？」 when people find something that catches their attention, often even when a listening party is not present.  It seems to have a similar function to "what", "what's that", or "huh".Since あれ isn't a "question word" itself, was this あれ contracted from a longer sentence  The closest I could think of is 「あれはなんだ？」, but I'm unsure.  If it isn't from a longer sentence, is there an explanation behind あれ as a questionI am also interested in if it was historically contracted from something.
I've just been thinking that if verb + なさい constructions are a combination of verb stem + なさる's 命令形, how on earth is something like しなさい possible. they both mean "do", don't they ("do do!) perhaps I'm completely over-thinking this. Is there a reason as to why なさい can't be used its own
I am pretty sure that when native speakers talk about speed, they say "速さ", "広さ" for width, "大きさ" for size, etc. Am I correct about this If I am, then:  Why not say "遅さ" instead of "速さ", "狭さ" instead of "広さ" I suspect that when you convert comparable adjectives to nouns, you should use the greater of the two. However, surely this must just be a convention, right So,"新幹線の速さは何ですか？" // wrong"新幹線の遅さは何ですか？" // wrong  what about:"snailの速さは何ですか？" // wrong"snailの遅さは何ですか？" // wrong  And finally, are there cases, if there are any, where it's natural to use "遅さ", "狭さ", "小ささ", etc.  thanks.
I'm finding it difficult to find a pattern in the usages of these two.When should I use 業績 over 実績
Closed. This question is off-topic. It is not currently accepting answers.                                            Want to improve this question Update the question so it's on-topic for Japanese Language Stack Exchange.                Closed 7 years ago.                        Improve this question                    I am using various programs to study Japanese:  audio CD's, Ja Sensei and TenguGo Japanese.  Kanji are grouped by JLPT levels.  Often kanji bleed across various levels.  For example車:  くるまAn example word for JLPT 5:自転車The example also includes two characters from JLPT 4.  Ive seen examples of Kanji from JLPT 2 and I think even 1 in there too!  What should I expect to see in JLPT 5  Do I need to know all meanings for a kanji and even all combinations including kanji from levels far and above my skill level  What about grammar
Correct me if I'm wrong, but 通訳 is used for translating conversations(interpreting) whereas 翻訳 is used more for translating documents, right I have a document that I had a Japanese friend translate verbally. Would that be 通訳 or 翻訳？ Or maybe another word I haven't heard of
One of my friends sent me this picture of a Pokemon game:It says:いつでも　どこでも　だれとでも　が  ポケモン勝負の　いいところ！Although the meaning seems fairly obvious, I can't figure out how the grammar works.I'm under the impression that が typically can't follow でも.  (I can't remember where I learned this rule, but I can find references online that agree.  For example, see the chart here on page 60 which says that が can't follow でも.)So why can が follow でも hereIs it possible that something is omitted before が  (This idea seems strange to me...)Is it something like 「いつでも」「どこでも」「だれとでも」が, where each of those three is treated as though it's a nounHow does the grammar work
The island of Tsushima is written 対馬{つしま}. Why No reading of 対 and 馬 can produce つしま, and clearly つしま has something to do with 島{しま}. There seems to also be no gikun-type motivation in meaning to write 対馬, which honestly is a weird name for an island ("against a horse").The Korean and Chinese names do use the characters 対馬 and Chinese-based readings though (daema and duima). However, it seems unlikely that the Chinese/Korean name came first, as the island is Japanese throughout history. In any case, even if 対馬 came from Chinese, why keep the つしま name
I've come across these two kanji in a few cases for "good/bad fortune" and even in combination with eachother.  I'd really like to understand if there's a subtle difference that I'm missing so that I know when to use each. Up to this point I've seen:Good luck/fortune: 幸運/幸福Bad luck/fortune: 不幸/不運I've also seen 不幸 mentioned as "miserable"  and 幸福 as "happy"Some insight would be awesome... Thanks!
どうせ知識だけ頭に詰め込んでる兵器A couple things confuse me:  How can we end a sentence in a noun  Whats the 「込んでる」  I thought something deru, but it doesn't use 出る.
So basically, how do you say something like "talk to the boss the way you talk to your father!" You know, with a threatening tone.
I want to convert this text to kanji.  A translation is optional, I really want to just figure out what the kanji is electronically.  人サベージ？I'm really not sure about the first character "hito" or the last character which looks like a 2 stroke something, but my dictionary has no such kanji.  Maybe these characters are some kind of enclosure similar to quotes
I'm confused about how to pronounce a word such as 一組. Are Japanese or Chinese numbers used when using 組 as a counter, and if the former how does it change phoneticallyFor example,　jisho.org lists both いちくみ and ひとくみ for 一組. My IME accepts both of those as 一組 and also takes　いちぐみ, いっくみ, and いっぐみ. Which if any of these is the correct or at least most common pronunciation
The following sentence was in an N4 review test:私の本棚には　買ったまま　読んでいない　まんが　が　たくさん　あります。The meaning, as I grasp it, is "There are a lot of books that I bought in my bookshelf that are left unread." But this is confusing because the grammar pattern, Past (た) + まま　essentially means "(while, left, stay) + verb" as in:妹は制服を着たままで寝てしまいました。My younger sister fell asleep while wearing her school uniform.How does 買ったまま make sense in this context
I am having difficulty locating this kanji. My guess is the radical is cliff "厂" with 7 strokes. However, my dictionary fails me. The closest I got is 后.
I'm wondering if there are consistent (or at least fairly reliable) rules for how to read numbers next to irregular counters, i.e. counters where you can't just put together the number and counter word in every situation. For example, the counter さい, the first number is not いちさい but いっさい. This is as opposed to counters like まい, where all you need to do to form the counter is add the number (e.g. ろく) and the counter, e.g. ろくまい.
I've been reading 魔法使いの夜 and stuck with this sentence -「体幹の見切りと筋肉の凝固弛緩その隙間。」. I completely cannot grasp the meaning from it, so I'll try to break it into parts and translate them.「体幹の見切り」 - the weak(見切り) part of torso 「筋肉の凝固弛緩」 - solidification and relaxation of the muscles  「その隙間」 - their weak point(opening)Can you please tell me where I'm mistaken, and help me with translating it. Thank you!  彼の思考には初めから、その点しか存在しない。ーー狙うは一点。意識の同一、呼吸の合致。体幹の見切りと筋肉の凝固弛緩その隙間。その地点こそ、唯一とも言える、生命の壁の亀裂である。人狼の胸に叩きつけられる、あまりにも弱い人の力。Full scene: http://www.youtube.com/watchv=fU-27H4XNAc (This part starts at 1:23)
I was doing some reading practice in a Japanese intro book of mine and I can't translate the second part of this sentence-二人は去年の九月に日本語文化を勉強しに来日しました。最初は日本語の勉強で大変でしたが、今は日本語もだんだんわかってきて、勉強にレジャーに忙しい毎日をおくっています。I'm a bit confused b/c of a few reasons.  I've never seen an adjective used prenominally to describe frequency/time expressions like 毎日.  I don't regard them as normal nouns cuz they don't really require a following particle so I thought they were more like adverbs really.  What does 忙しい毎日 mean here  Everyday, which is busy  Can you use adj. for other time words like 寒い明日  Does that even make any senseAlso I don't really get how the に particles in「勉強にレジャーに」are being used here.  Are they making the preceding nouns into adverbs, a reason for doing something, etc. EDIT:  I added more of the passage to put the sentence in better context.
I was sure about translating "火の玉" as "fireball", but Google Translate suggests another meaning - "falling star".Can it really be translated like that If it's true, then in what contexts
Specifically in a case like this:私が迷っているうちに、次第に登校する生徒の数は少なくなり、予鈴が鳴った。Does 次第に modify 登校する or 少なくなり I thought that maybe 登校する生徒の数 is considered as one unit and thus 次第に modifies 少なくなり. Is that impossible
One of my textbooks says:When たら used with N/なadjective+ではない, は should be omitted.So it should be でなかったら NOT ではなかったら.This seems strange because it never explains why.However, I do see sentences like this:ここで質問することではなかったらすみません。Now I am puzzled why the text makes such statements. This textbook is widely used in my country, probably more than 100 million people are using or have used it. It should not contain so many errors.
I have the following translation I need to do for my introductory Japanese class.最近、交通事故が多いので、左に曲がる時は、自転車や、通行人に気をつけなければなりませんよ。So far I have the following.Recently there have been a lot of traffic accidents so when you turn left, you have to watch out for bicycles and _____ and things like that (I'm telling you). I am not sure what 通行人 means. I think 通行 means traffic (though how is that different than 交通) And 人 means person. So, traffic person. I can imagine this meaning either a pedestrian or a car driver. Or maybe even a traffic directing cop. Also, how would you pronounce this word That is, what is the hiragana Is it just the combination of the two parts こうつうにん
For example, the word サッカー is "soccer" in English, but the romanization "sakkā" bears little resemblance to the original word. Are there any loan words in Japanese that preserve the spelling of the original language when Hepburn romanization is applied
こん。ちょっと質問があります。★ Hello. I've got a quick question.この曲、「僕に彼女ができたんだ」と呼んでいますが、タイトルの意味が分からない。★ Even though the song is called 「僕に彼女ができたんだ」, I don't know what the title means.暇があったら、手伝ってください。日本語と英語、どっちでもいい。★ If you've got some time help me out. Japanese, English - whatever is cool.よろしく！★ Thanks!
In the past, I have come across several examples of ～たり～たり seemingly being used with other final verbs than する, which is generally taught to be mandatory at the end of ～たり～たり phrases.Is this grammatically acceptableHere are some example phrases from some quick googling:立ったり座ったり働く話したり笑ったり食べるAlso, these seem to be describing that final verb. They could be rephrased (as I understand them) as Vながら～たり～たりする, or something to that effect. Am I understanding this correctlyEdit #1As @snailboat pointed out in chat, my interpretation of these can also be rephrased as:立ったり座ったりして働く話したり笑ったりして食べるIs this what those mean Or are they, for example, 立ったり座ったり働いたりするMy feeling is that they mean the former. However, one example I found which I feel could go either way is　「のんびりしたりうろついたり食べるのが好きです」. I'm not really sure how to interpret that one.Edit #2Can this also be done with adjectives I have come across several examples:可愛かったり美しいダルかったりキツい日
E.G. お忘れなき ＆ 迷いなしI know they're both ways to end a a sentence, but I never could figure what make each different from the other. Anyone have a clue
Do Anime and other casual writers try to make true sound words or just words similar to the emphatic words already existing in Japanese- true some of those are fairly close to the real sounds but a lot aren't.  Its obvious if its a dog they say　ヲオフ or バルク 　rather　limiting themselves to　 ワンワン and many other better examples of the word expressing something more abstract rather than the trying for the actual sound within the limits of Japanese writing but what if the context isn't so clear- how do you tell
I remember reading that there's a historical process called 連声【れんじょう】 which explains words like 天皇:　　天皇　　　　てん＋おう　＝　てんのう　　云々　　　　うん＋うん　＝　うんぬん　　銀杏　　　　ぎん＋あん　＝　ぎんなんDoes this ever happen in modern Japanese  For example, does anyone ever pronounce 南欧 like なんのう rather than なんおう  Or would that be very strange
I have the following sentence that I have to translate for my homework. 今、ちょうど一番下のむす子が、昼寝をしているところです。I am having trouble with the 一番下のむす子 part. I think might mean "youngest son" (number 1 low's son), but I am not sure.Right now ... is just in the midst of taking a nap.Can anyone help me understand this sequence Thank you.Also, out of curiosity, what is the romaji for the 昼寝 hirone or chuune
In Zukkoke Otokomichi, they translate things like 中ってこうぜ as "Let's ~" Why does こうぜ mean let's Is it just slang, or does it come from　行こう, just dropping the 行？
いまいち  imaichi  (common) 【今一】  いまひとつ  imahitotsu  (common) · イマイチ  IMAICHI   【今一 · 今一つ · いま一つ · 今ひとつ】  adjectival noun → conjugation / adverb:1.)one more;  another;  the other;  —Usually written using kana alone.  Colloquialism.2.)not quite;  not very good;  lackingいまいち東芝は信用できない。 I can't really trust Toshiba.いい人だけどイマイチね。 He is nice, but he's not the one for me. ▾  not quite;  not very good;  lackingIs it because if something needs "one more" then it is lacking in something, and thus can be seen as not good
I have been trying to teach myself Japanese. I learned the basic hiragana (あ,い,う,お), but I am confused on how to pronounce words like あう. I was trying to combine the sounds あ and う, but when I checked with Google Translate, I found the pronunciation was different (see link). How did Google come up with that pronunciation Are the sounds just run together
I would like to know what the meaning of the word mononoke is Of course it's the name of the princess in Miyazaki's wonderful film Mononoke-hime, but what is the deeper and actual meaning of the word itself and what does it mean to the ordinary Japanese Does it have any positive/or negative connotationsIn Japanese I think it's either 物の怪 or もののけ. I obviously don't read Japanese so I have no idea.I have read the Wikipedia material concerning the word, but that left me unsatisfied.
What is the role of the な in bold in this sentence Is it a nominalized だ考えれば考える程彼女がどういう女なのか分からなくなってきます。
The J&gt;E dictionaries I've consulted translate 迷信 as "superstition", but cross-checking in Daijirin the definition doesn't seem to explicitly reference the supernatural, instead referring to the lack of a scientific basis for the belief.Can you use 迷信 to refer to a myth in the sense of a widely held misconception (like, "a duck's quack doesn't echo"), or is it limited to things like "black cats are bad luck"If you can't use 迷信 for the first kind of myth, what word would you use instead
What's the difference in usage and meaning when using を with 大好き or 好き versus using が I would think that using が is stating that the subject that you are talking about is loved, while using を is suggesting that they are being loved, despite the fact that 好き is an adjective, not a verb. However, I read elsewhere that using を is actually less strong. What's the difference
I assume 詰まらない came from 詰まる， so my question is then two fold. Why does 詰まらない have the meaning it does (Does it just mean it's not packed, in the sense that it's boring) and also, are there other 形容詞 that simply pulled themselves from the 否定形？Lastly, did I phrase my question correctly I know it's not directly related, but I felt a little weird writing とは, I never know how to reference words.
I know that ように can be used like 'as' or 'like' and can also be used like 'ために'. But I was watching this TV show where they show 絵馬 and I noticed that almost all the wishes  end with ように, which I couldn't understand at first. A web search turned up this which says:if it's at the end of a sentence (or just after a verb, but that's usually at the end), it can mean you want something to happen, or like... "may x happen" or "let x happen" My question is, could you use this in every day conversation Like for example, if I hope our team wins, could I say: 勝ちますように My extremely limited experience says it sounds weird, but is it I remember hearing ように used like this before (いい物見つかりますように) but that was in a game (and spoken by a little child) so I'm not sure if that counts.
I'm currently doing a study on Japanese homophones and came across 柔らかい and 軟らかい. Most other homophones seem to have noticeable differences in usage (or have explanations online), but I can't seem to find any English explanation for this pair.Jisho gives the same definition for each:soft; tender; limpso I'm not completely sure what's going on.Examples would be appreciated, too!
What do you call the small pieces of wood() where people write wishes on and hang them on some stand close to where you tie folded o-mikuji (おみくじ) Or are they also called おみくじ Related question:Also, in some temples, there's also this little cabinet where you can put a lighted candle (I remember seeing one in a temple near Ueno Park). What do you call that
What the difference between saying さようならだ and さようなら If it had to guess I would be what seems to be obvious, one is declaring it to be goodbye-but is this the case I've never heard さようならだ used before.
According to all standard book and webpage I consulted, godan verb's potential form are produced by first changing to え (e) form, and then add in る (ru).But a native Japanese speaker (who is also fluent in English) told me that what needed to be added should be られる (rareru) rather than just る (ru), and added that "youth these day" keep dropping sounds from words. Its applicability to godan verb was specifically mentioned with specific example, so there was not a confusion with ichidan verb. It is also mentioned that this apply to both positive and negative potential too. I asked around, and it seems like colloquially the ら (ra) often get dropped in casual conversation. However, I cannot find anyway for the れ (re) to be dropped. It seems rude to go back and query further on the question, especially since it would sound like I am accusing that person of not knowing their own language.So I would like to ask, if anyone know possible register's or dialectical differences, be it between different region, or between generation, or between texting and talking, or whatever, that would require to add られる (rareru) instead of just る (ru) for the potential form for godan verb Thank you.
Another thread stated that when expressing agreement, we can choose between 「ね」 and 「な」. 「ね」 is more feminine and 「な」 is more masculine.By that, would 「そうな」 be  the masculine form of 「そうね」 Also, since 「そうだね」 and 「そうですね」 both use 「ね」, are they actually the feminine form of  「そうだな」 and 「そうですな」
I sense that using "なん" in questions probably makes the question sound more formal:"どこですか？""どこなんですか？" // maybe more formal"いつですか？""いつなんですか？" // maybe more formal"だれですか""だれなんですか？" // maybe more formal....Am I right about this Maybe this is very similar to the function of [美化語]{びかご}  But, I don't remember ever seeing this in written Japanese. I suspect that this is just because using fewer characters trumps whatever formality "なん" may, or may not, inject into questions
One of my textbook says:だ　and 　か can not be used together, like:Example: これは本か。(Is this a book) You can NOT say: これは本だか。The textbook also says:疑問詞（ぎもんし）（どれ、どちら、どなた、どこ、だれ、いつ etc) When used in a sentence with か, you should not use だ.Another example: どの人が李先生か知っていますか。You can NOT say: どの人が李先生だか知っていますか。However, when I surf the Japanese websites, I noticed sentences like this:この人だれだか分かりますか？ Here, だ　and 　か is used together.Isn't it supposed to be この人だれか分かりますか？Does that mean the textbook is not accurate
A: あ……えっと……何か手伝うことは、ありますか？B: ん？　あぁ、この辺はドシロウトにできるこっちゃないからな。　邪魔にならねぇように先にメシでも食って、後は舞台袖ででも大人しくしてなPretty much in general でも and ても don't sit well in my mind. There have been a lot of times I see them in a context in which they don't make sense to me as "even" or "even if/though" or in the case of でも as で and も individually. In this case the manner of speech is colloquial so maybe that's why it seems so odd. What really confuses me is ででも. Can someone explain the use でも and ででも hereAs a bonus, is にならねぇ just にならない with a a different emphasis
I need a bit of help with my Japanese. If I want to say:Castle X is beautiful.  Among all the castles in the world, castle X is the coolest. Is this sentence written correctly しろ　Xの　ほうが　きれいで　せかいの　すべての　しろの　なかで、　しろ　Xが いちばん　かっこいい　です。
You would think that sentence structure would matter in songs and poems, especially when they have directed or dedicated lyrics, e.g. to a stranger, the president, someone of higher status.Alternatively, is 丁寧語, 尊敬語, or 謙譲語 even remotely usable in lyrical artI am speculating that this is related to polite language impeding the relaying of emotion. There's a somehow related article discussing if 警護 makes communication difficult, which is another question on its own.
I've started learning keigo and already having difficulty with it, with the same problem in both そんけいご and けんじょうご.　In particular, I'm having trouble understanding the combination of the use of ～ていらっしゃる and  お＋verb stem＋になる, and　～ておる and お＋verb stem＋にする.So what example if you had the question and you wanted to change it so that it involves そんけいご.先生はどちらに住んでいますか。Would you change it to:-&gt;　先生はどちらに住んでいらっしゃいますか。-&gt; 先生はどちらにお住みになっていらっしゃいますか。-&gt; 先生はどちらにお住みになっていますか。I've seen a combination of all three usages (e.g. 疲れていらっしゃいます、 お教えになっていらっしゃいます and お教えになっています), but I can't find any clear explanation of when one is preferred over the others. Or are they are equivalentSame problem applies to ～ておる and お＋verb stem＋にする, though I'd assume the explanation and reasoning behind it would be the same as そんけいご.
I'm interested in why the extra small tsu in included in the word デバッグ but not バグ.  Are there any rules governing voicing in words formed via reduplicationLyman's rule may explain this, but does anyone know any more information on why the triple voiced compound is resolved by adding a small tsu (like maybe why a long sound or something different isn't used)
In 上を向いて歩こう Kyu Sakamoto says しあわせは, why doesn't he says しあわせさは How do you know which 形容動詞 can be written as nouns without さ？
I was wondering, what does the よう form of ある even mean Does あろう act as volition of the object being spoken about For example... if someone says 雨が降るでしょう(であろう）... is it the same as "It WILL rain" in that volition is being applied to the object being spoken aboutI'm not looking for ties to English, it's just a lucky example.No matter how many times someone tries to explain でしょう to me it doesn't make sense... I've been trying to think of it as "It is my guess that"... but it doesn't work in some cases...I still figure that there are two options:The kinda iffy option based in someone telling me that the よう form is comprised of a "guess particle"... "う":The よう form highlights your guess about the future... so saying 行こう means that you are placing your bets so to speak that "going" is what most probably will eventuate.The way I think makes more sense:よう form truly does equate to our "will" and thereby is used in the same sense as "I will go"”行こう" and "it will rain""雨が降るでしょう"
My grammar book says:Verb/Adjective/Na-Adjective+なくてもいいですIs it OK to use Noun+なくてもいいです, like:明日でなくてもいいですMy grammar book also says:Verb/Noun+なければなりませんIs it OK to use Adjective/Na-Adjective+なければなりません, like:高くなければなりませんきれいでなければなりません
A few years ago, I came across the issue of one kanji having multiple stroke counts. Now, I need to review this:牙 = (4 or 5 strokes)瓜 = (5 or 6 strokes)邑 = (6 or 7 strokes)....  If native speakers don't know about this ambiguity, then I'll just ignore it. But, if it is something to be aware of, can someone please check these assertions(1) Depending on the era, some kanji's stroke counts changed. One stroke count is considered correct in modern Japan, while the other is just a historical footnote.(2) Counter to the trend of simplifying kanji, the modern writings have the greater number of strokes. Any more information would be welcomed. thanks.
ひとまず心を落ち着けようと、飲みかけのオレンジジュースに手を伸ばす。Please help. I came across this line and I don't really understand use of と here. How exactly does と work here
A girl ties up a cat and puts it in the corner. She's not paying attention and it escapes. When she looks in the corner she sees the ropes, and she sees that the cat is gone, and she says "逃げられた".Is that （猫が）逃げられた = 逃げることが出来た, or is it （私は猫に）逃げられたEDIT: Just to clarify, the first one is meant to be the potential form, and the second one is meant to be the passive form.
I always hear people saying 　　　先に行ってて　which means 'go ahead' But I don't really understand the meaning of the last て. I know it's the abbreviation of いて but if I translate it to English, I always think like this.　　　先に行っていて - Going aheadSo anyone can explain the latter 'te' of this sentence
In English, we can distinguish between not wanting to do something, and wanting to not do something.  It's not a distinction that we usually make, but it is possible:P = "do anything"A. "I want to not do anything."    　 WANT(NOT(P))B. "I don't want to do anything."　   NOT(WANT(P))    The first sentence means WANT(NOT(P)) "I want to do nothing". The second sentence literally means NOT(WANT(P)) "I lack the desire to do anything", but by implication it usually also means WANT(NOT(P)) "I want to do nothing".  Since this is just an implication, it's possible for it to be cancelled in certain contexts.I was wondering if something similar is true of 〜したくない.  Take a look at this sentence:何もしたくない。I think this usually means WANT(NOT(P)) "I want to do nothing".  But is it possible for it to mean NOT(WANT(P)) "I lack the desire to do anything" as wellCan 何もしたくない have either meaning
I understand that ちょっと待って means "please wait a while".But I did hear some people using ちょっと待った for the same meaning (maybe).So what is the difference between these two and when should we use 待って or 待った？
"この先生き残るには" is a riddle that highlights the problem of not having spaces between words. But, I was able to read it pretty quickly. After blowing past "先生", I read "き", and that stopped me in my tracks. Starting over, I felt the only thing that could be done was to break between "先” and "生". And then I could read it.  These probably are the same question:(-) Excepting "お" and "ご" when used as 美化語, can a word that has at least one kanji also begin with a kana(-)  A kana, that is not one of the 助詞, placed between two kanji cannot be a word break, right
A:藤原さんは、もちろん歌だよね？  B:うん。わたしにはそれしかないから……ダンスとかあったら全然だったと思うI don't get what the part ダンスとかあったら全然だったと思う is saying. 全然 is an adverb but there's no verb after it but 思う, but that's separated by a quoting particle, so I assume it doesn't modify it. If that's the case, it's to be assumed that the verb after 全然 is dropped, right Or should 全然 and と思う go together. Please help me understand the meaning here.
I'm having trouble with Ｘからきた as a modifier...I have heard people say 住んでいるのはどこ？ or something like that in order to say like, "where are you living"... but what if someone wanted to say どこから来た？ in this manner Like... "The country I came from is called Australia".I can't say から来た国はオーストラリアという because you can't have から just sitting there like that... and you can't say 私が来た国はオーストラリアだ because you can't tell whether I'm saying I came from there or came to here (isolated from context).Is there a way to fit から in there
What phrase do you use to ask for the n-th position of an object Is there a straightforward and general way to do soe.g. order of childbirth, place did the runner finishSince you can use 3人目 for third, can you use 何人目 or 第何子 to ask, perhaps(This especially hard to ask since English has problems conveying this.)
The original sentence is:人間は一人では生きていけません。and the requirement is to change the sentence with a "ものです" ending.I did this: 人間は一人では生きていけないものです.Am I right
I've been thinking of the ても pattern as "even though" or "even if". But this sentence from steins;gate uses it in a way that surprised me...ちょっと待ってくれ。そんなに急かされて【せかされて】も、転んでしまうよIs this being used in the common way (if so, I may have been thinking of it wrong) Or is this a different way of using it, with a different meaningEDIT: If I took my normal approach here, I'd end up with something like, "even if you rush me, I will fall", which, I think people will agree, doesn't really make sense in english (it implies that the person speaking will fall whether or not they're rushed, and that the person rushing him is doing so with the intention of preventing him from falling). Maybe the interpretation should be something like, "even if you rush me, (I won't get there any faster, and) I (may even) fall."
Recently I was in Japan and stayed at a certain hotel for a few days.  I was surprised to see the level of customer service that I received.  There were many cultural differences that surprised me, but the one thing I wasn't sure how to react was to all the お帰りなさいませ I received when I got back to the hotel.  I was born in Japan, but living in America for the majority of my life, I'm used to replying when someone says something to me.  My mom told me that it's very uncommon for people to reply in such situations but I could not stop my habits.  I thought about what would be a good thing to say since ただいま would be strange, as the hotel is not my home.  So I came up with お疲れ様です。 as my reply.Does that sound strange and if so are there better phrases I could've used in that situation Or should I have just kept my mouth shut and said nothing at all
In my book I found this sentence...Ａさんの健康に関して、特にその食事に関しての心配が、Ａさんの心も家族の心をも蝕んでいるのだ。I understand the sentence, but I had no idea such a particle combination was possible... could someone please explain it to me Is this common
I understand that obviously every Japanese textbook will go into this topic briefly... but I can never really come to grips with what it means in Japanese. If anyone could link me to a good Japanese dictionary entry about it that would be great (I can't find a good one that explains it)I am interested in the し particle as used below...歯は痛いし、歯医者には行きたくないし、困ったよ。I was wondering if the し particle had anything to do with する/しか/しも.職場は失うし、妻とは別れるし（で）、彼はひどく元気がない。Here, it seems like し seems to turn the reasons into some sort of noun phrase because the author has stated you can use で with them. Knowing the essential underlying meanings behind ので and から helps me to unconsciously decide between them... I kinda have no idea how to do the same with し so...Can anyone enlighten me or link me to somewhere where I could be enlightened on the matter
i was playing Katahane last night, in it Light and Wakaba refer to their mother as Kaa-san while Light refers to Wakaba (his older sister) as Nee-san and when meeting with Rien he says for them to call him Jii-san by commentingIf you did not know my name or who i was i would just be an old man to you correct^ (he's not saying that in a bad way mind you)also in Fate/Stay Night, Sakura refers to Rin as Nee-san and the 2 of them are sister however Sakura was adopted out to prevent a potential fight over Magus Succession between them (like what happens with Touko and Aoko)from my understanding, Okaa-san is Mother, Onee-San is Big Sister and Ojii-san is Grandfather, now while Kaa-san and Nee-san i can still determine refer to Mother and Sister i'm assuming Jii-san is something close to Grandfather as Rein in Katahane is almost like a grandfather to Cero and since Wakaba is close to Cero (potential love interest in one route) i'm assuming he doesn't mind being though of as a grandfather but that's seculation, so i am wondering, what is the difference between Okaa-san/Onee-san/Ojii-san and Kaa-san/Nee-san/Jii-san apart from the obvious drop of O from each word
I'm trying to translate a phrase、許せるはずもなく. Generally, I think the meaning should be along the lines of "We were not forgiven," but with the grammatical structure of verb + hazu + naku, would it be directly translated as "We were not able to be forgiven"
A sentence from JapanesePod101, with the official translation.サンダルは、空港から空港へ空の旅をするときに便利だ。  Sandals are convenient for traveling through airports.To me 空港から空港へ sounds like "moving from one airport to another", but does this particular phrase simply mean walking through an airport as the translation suggests
I came across the following sentence in a Manga:コケっぷりもかわいいです。and I looked the sentence up in the translated Manga, where I found something like (translation was into German):And she's also really funny. (Hach, und urkomisch ist sie auch noch)I found コケ in a dictionary meaning "fool", so my first try would have been something like:She's a bit foolish, but sweet. But the っぷり is the missing element which I couldn't find anywhere. Does this modify the meaning of コケ in a specific way Can it be used to modify other words as well (According to google, it can, it seems to work even for nouns and verbs) I also found this: http://www.lang.nagoya-u.ac.jp/nichigen/menu7_folder/symposium/pdf/8/01.pdf during my research, but couldn't make too much sense of it. So, my question is: What does っぷり do What kind of language/situation can it be used in (more informal, formal, ..) How does it help me arrive at the translation suggested by the translator
I've been working on a script for a Visual Novel, in it one of the heroine's Sakura address's the main hero Talavaliau (Tala for short) as Sempai because she has a crush on him and can't bring herself to actually call him by his name even with honorifics but also as a sign of respect for his naturei base this on a number of anime/manga/books/games i have seen where a younger girl addresses an older crush as sempai and in most cases their just a class year's difference or have a year gap between their agei know that sempai is used as a form of respect for younger students to address older students however in my script, Tala ends up being reassigned into Sakura's class so they are in the same year in the school, Tala's and Sakua's age are the same but Tala's birthday falls on the same day as his foster sister (he no longer remembers his real birth date and uses the day he was saved/adopted) which is only 1 month before Sakura'sso i am wondering if Sempai can be used to address a student of the same year/age or if i should use another term which doesn't involve using a person's name

この本は読むのに簡単だ。This book is easy to read.  この本は読むのが簡単だ。This book is easy to read.I was wondering if anyone could explain to me how these two readings differ in nuance When there is a sentence like the one below I can see how it would be different if が was used.彼女は夕食を料理するのに忙しい。  She is busy cooking dinner.It seems like it is saying "She is busy in the act of cooking dinner"So would it be that のに focuses on being IN the act whereas のが just connects the following attribute to the preceding verbBONUS QUESTION: can you say 料理するのには忙しい
I am having a bit of trouble separating の and もの when they serve the purpose of turning a verb phrase into a noun.The の noun seems to satisfy a few purposes...It seems to be like "one"... like when you say "the red one is mine""赤いのは私のです"And it also seems to be work like "~ing" "It is hard to swim" "泳ぐのが難しい”At least in the first example, I can give "one" meaning and explain it...The second one is kind of like the "to" in "to swim" isn't itI want to know if you can give の a meaning, or have some way to visualize it in order to distinguish it from もの
The following lyrics are from a song called "YOU":"もう止まらない　あなたがあなたのことが恋しい"Mou tomaranai　 anata ga anata no koto ga koishiiI know that "mou tomaranai" = "no longer stops" and "anata no koto ga koishii" = "miss/long for you" but that "ga" in the middle throws me off. It looks like it's saying "You miss the you that won't stop anymore", but that doesn't make sense to me given the rest of the context.Any ideas
When talking about same-sex relationships in modern Japanese (not Edo-era), are the same words used for husbands and wives as you'd use for opposite-sex relationshipsFor example, can you use ご主人 to describe (politely) a man's husband, and 奥さん to describe (politely) a woman's wife Or do Japanese speakers regard "a man's wife" and "a woman's wife" as different concepts best described with different words
A: Can we have a date tomorrow too  B: Don't get carried away! ^^;A: 明日もデートしてくれる？  B: 調子{ちょうし}に乗{の}るなー！ ^^;I just would like some clarification to see exactly how 調子に乗る works.I see it literally as "ride the tone" which I hesitantly extrapolate as to "get carried away by the feeling," which can be seen as an equivalent to another translation of this phrase, "to feel cocky."Is this line of thinking along the right trackIs this only an informal expressionWhat is its level of rudeness or politenessOther examples: http://eow.alc.co.jp/searchq=調子に乗る&amp;ref=sa調子に乗っていると 失敗{しっぱい}するよ｜You'll fail if you get carried away too much.
I have posted a "status" on Facebook:Dear santa, I would like for you to bring him for christmasMy boyfriend commented:Your Wish is my command!And my Japanese manager (from our office) commented:ごちそうさま!!In this case, what does ごちそうさま!! mean  I think it is definitely not the meaning "Thanks for the meal".So, are there any other meanings of ごちそうさま!!？
What is the difference between ほぼ and ほとんどThey both mean almost, don't they Can they both be used in both positive and negative
I have the sentence in my book:昔は、若い女性が男性と二人で出かけようものなら、町中のうわさになったものだ。I was wondering if this means that it is possible to modify nouns with the volitional form. I have so far heard that it isn't, which makes this grammar point confusing. Could someone give me an explanation as to how to understand ~ようものなら in the above sentence Is it like, "If women WISHED to go out  with men..." Or does the volitional have some other interpretation here
I thought that の always had to modify a noun... so how come a sentence like the following is possible despite there being no nominalization of what follows の たたみに布団を敷いて寝てみたものの、背中が痛くて寝られなかった。Is this a different type of の or does の work differently to how I imagined it I there any elision If the ものの construction has no such explanation then I am ok with that, but if there is one I'd like to hear it.
What is the most common Japanese word to use when referring to any kind of enemy in a video game. I know the word モンスター is common for non-human enemies, but is there just a general term for any kind of enemy Thank you
Disclaimer: This relates to prose, I would never consider being intentionally rude in real life.I'm currently writing a short-story, and in it there's a scene in a Japanese restaurant. It calls for one of the characters (female) to call the waiter over and request a bottle of Sake (nihonshu), as per the chef's recommendation.My own—slow but ongoing—study of Japanese, is of little help, because text-books has an awful tendency to mangle the politeness in these matters.  From what I understand of the politeness customs in Japan, a customer would probably not be more polite toward the staff, than the staff toward the customer.So, how would one, as a woman, in conversational Japanese, bordering on being downright rude, order a bottle of the house's recommended rice-wineMy own best guess would be "Oi, nihonshu kudasai!", but that doesn't sound right to me…
These four words all seem to mean "group," but what are the nuanced differences When can a group be identified with one/some of these but not the others How much overlap is there between them組{くみ} as in 赤組 vs. 白組 (at an 運動会, for example , "white team" vs. "red team")団{だん} as in 劇団, 楽団, 応援団, 代表団班{はん} as in everything here since it seems to be used more as a single word than as part of a compound (example being 班にもっと頑張ってもらう)群{ぐん} (occasionally むれ when kun-yomi (but usually with okurigana)) as in here, for the same reasons as above (example [群]{むれ}を作って～の回りに集まる)
For example, in the sentence 飲んだり食べたりした. Does this たり have anything to do with the -(i)tari ending in Classical Japanese that meant the present progressive (and later semantically shifted to past, and then even later truncated to -ta) As in われ食べたり = 私は食べているIt seems quite similar, attaching to the 連用形 (albeit with 音便), and with the same form. The meaning is very, very different though. Are they related

Since my recent question about 〜く＋ある,  I've been trying to learn more about the differences between 形容詞「無い」 and 助動詞「〜ない」.  In other words, I'm trying to learn how the independent adjective nai and the negative verb suffix -(a)nai are different.We have a question about whether verbs ending in 〜ない are adjectives already, and in one answer, a user writes that the negative verb 食べない can't take the suffix -さ, so *食べなさ is unacceptable.  I was curious whether that was true of all verbs, so I decided to search for なさ in the Balanced Corpus of Contemporary Written Japanese (BCCWJ).  Unfortunately, this had a lot of false positives due to forms like 〜なさい, 〜なさそう, 〜なさすぎる, and verbs like なさる, and so on.To filter out false positives, I decided that I needed to search for a more specific example.  The form I chose was 分からなさ, because regardless of whether it's correct or not, it made sense to me.  I was able to find only one example in BCCWJ, and it was taken from the web portion of the corpus:泣きました・・・。もうダメだ・・・。　意味の分からなさで言えばきっとハウルなんかと大差ないんだろうけど・・・。ヤバい・・・。 This example seems very informal, and I suppose the author wasn't worrying about writing "properly". I was able to find more examples on Google by searching for 意味の分からなさ, some of which seemed a little bit less informal:もはやその言葉の意味の分からなさは、僕らの常識をはるかに上回っております。 (link)  しかし、この、石の意味の分からなさこそが、最も素晴らしい点だと思います。 (link)  ここから、「意味の分からなさ」ということを考えた。 (link)  I'm not sure if I can draw any conclusions from these examples.  My guess is that using -さ like this is only acceptable informally, judging by how I can find results online but not in published books.  But I suppose it's also possible that the results I've found are very unusual, or that I've misunderstood what -さ is doing in these examples.So, is 意味の分からなさ strange
How do you say after (insert verb here) in Japaneselike after studying, after drinkingwould after studying be benkyotte kara (べんきょうってから）
これはアメリカ人にも読める日本語の本です。I received this sentence as an example of に being used with potential form in a passive sense, but even though the person said they were Japanese (online) I have never seen anything like this ever. What is this grammar point Can I have any other examples If it is incorrect, how would you say "Y can be done by X" where it is both potential and passive
I like to visualise things to try and understand them as an idea not a rehearsed rule.I like to think of hazu in terms of it being a notch in a bow for the arrow as I hear the meaning stemmed from there. I won't get into that too much but...Is there any way to understand べき in a similar manner I hear it is related to "CAN" because it uses the same kanji "可き".  How should I understand its nuance

These two words both appear to have the meaning "to give birth" or "to produce".However, what is the difference between the two kanji usedI originally assumed that 生む meant "to give birth" and 産む meant "to produce", but looking at some example sentences, they seem to be used interchangeably. What is going on there
This sentence is from Japanese the Manga Way panel 371, translation as given in the textbook.和尚にたのまれていた肉体労働も今のうちに片づけてしまう。  I'll also go ahead and finish off that physical labour that the priest asked me to do.My question is regarding the speaker's (Kousuke) choice of たのまれていた. It seems clear that ～ている is being used in the "state resulting from an action" rather than the continual sense, i.e. it refers to the priest's request putting Kousuke in a state where he felt obliged to fulfil it. But if the request is still standing, why is he referring to it in the past tense たのまれていた gives me the impression that "I was asked, but it's not an issue now". To me たのまれている or simply たのまれた make more sense.One possible explanation is that Kousuke had been letting this request stand for a while, to the extent that he felt sufficiently disconnected from "the state of being requested" to use the past tense.Context: Summer is getting too hot for strenuous exercise, so Kousuke decides he'll suspend his jogging until cooler days arrive in the fall. He also figures he should take care of the wood he'd promised to chop for the priest at the nearby temple before it gets any hotter. (verbatim from the textbook)  Kousuke delivers this sentence as an internal monologue.
I'd like to see if I understand a couple grammar points correctly.  I'd like to rewrite this sentence: 1. 食べも飲みもしないAs either one of these: 2a. 食べなくも　　飲まなくもある   2b. 食べなくもあり飲まなくもあるI think both 2a and 2b are grammatical with the same meaning as 1.  But I'm not sure I've done this correctly, and I'm particularly unsure about whether the あり is necessary in the first half.  The following is my reasoning.  (I've tried to express it as clearly as I can, but it's probably too long and confusing--my apologies!)I'm working off Hiroshi Aoyagi's idea that -i is a suppletive form of -ku ar-(r)u, so the end of the sentence looks like this:　　*飲みも　　 しなくある　　 　→　飲みも　　 しない   *nom(i)-mo si-na-ku ar-u　→　nom(i)-mo si-naiHere, the stem si appears because the suffix -(a)na-ku needs to have something to attach to, and it can't attach directly to the verb stem nom- because -mo is in the way.I'm moving -(a)na-ku before -mo and attaching it directly to both verb stems, so si is no longer necessary and it disappears.  But the tense morpheme -(r)u still needs to appear at the end of the sentence, so I have to insert the dummy verb  ar- for it to attach to:　　飲まなくも　　　　ある　　nom-(a)na-ku-mo ar-uSince -mo appears between -ku and ar-(r)u, it can't take the usual form of -i.Since the tense morpheme -(r)u only has to appear once at the end of the sentence, I don't think I need to add the dummy verb ar- to the first half.  But if I do, I think it ends up in "infinitive" form (あり):　　食べなくも　　　   　　 飲まなくも　　　　ある　　tabe-na-ku-mo        nom-(a)na-ku-mo ar-u　　食べなくも　　　あり　　 飲まなくも　　　　ある　　tabe-na-ku-mo ar-(i) nom-(a)na-ku-mo ar-uSo based on this, I suspect that both 2a and 2b are equivalent to 1.  Am I correct or mistaken
Hello everyone I cannot grasp the meaning of さて in the following sentence, as far as I can understand it's same as this, however I'm not confident about it. "...for young man it was like throwing the dice, whose number will definitly show up, sooner or later."(I translated only the part with さて)どうせ行くあてもなく、帰る途もなく、三界に置き所もないこの身の上だ、ままよと、渡し守の申し出を受け入れたのが、青年には賽を投げ出すようにも思われてさて、この目は一体いずれと出ることだろう。Also there is a part that makes me wonder, why the author put この before 身の上 The narration is in 3rd person, but with この it translates like "my body" which sounds strange in this sentence, or maybe I'm misunderstanding something
While I've only seen 結論 used in expressions like "Which conclusion do you arrive at",I've seen both 断定 and 結論 used when saying "Don't draw a hasty conclusion".What are the differences between the two, and when is one more appropriate than the other
I was under the impression that 安い is used for anything related to "cost", whereas 低い is used to mean low for all things general.However, a simple Google search shows ~99k records for 低いお給料, contrasted to ~273k records for 安いお給料.Is it proper to use 低い to mean "low salary"Or is it simply an example of usage corruption

So today in class, I actually learned that the Japanese game company "Sega"'s name is actually written in Katakana, not Hiragana.  I learned the same also applies to some other notable companies, such as Toyota and Honda. But it seems there are also companies that don't have katakana names, such as Mitsubishi.Is there any way to tell right off the bat whether or not a Japanese company's name is in hiragana or katakana    When I asked my teacher, she mentioned it might have something to do with how famous or popular the company may have been.
Out of curiosity I looked up その in a monolingual dictionary, the first thing I see Is ［連体］《代名詞「そ」＋格助詞「の」から》What on earth is a "case marking particle" Is this the の particle that simply means "of"So, if I were to translate it literally, a phrase like その上 would mean "above of that" "on top of that" while "その人" "person of that" Sounds like complete gibberish to me when I try to think of it that way though.
I'm uncertain about the usage of 注意する in this sentence from Japanese the Manga Way,Chapter 25 page 198. The context is that a woman has noticed the following message written on the back of her husband the section chief, presumably by his subordinates. The translation is that given by the textbook.課長は酔うと裸になるので、奥さまから注意してください。    When your husband gets drunk, he takes off his clothes, so please caution him.The textbook goes on to define 注意する as "to warn/caution", and explains that から marks　奥さま as the source of the action. But isn't she the subject of 注意する, the one doing the warning If it was the passive 注意させる I could understand, but it isn't. To me this sounds more grammatical:課長は酔うと裸になるので、(奥さまが)注意してください。Alternatively, I'm aware that 注意する can also mean "to pay attention/to be careful", so maybe the 奥さまから注意してください is actually a request to the section chief, i.e. please be alerted to your behaviour (from your wife). Then 課長 is the subject of 注意する, which now means "to be warned/aware". This seems rather like a passive construction in disguise.What is the correct interpretation of 注意する in this context
I've come across several instances in manga where the simple question of "で" is used. What could it mean I'm guessing it means something like "Is that so," but I'm not sure.
I know it's a stretch, and I'm pretty sure it's not, but is 名前 related to name I always thought it was weird that they were so similar in pronunciation.
う～ん、3週間も空けてしまっていたOh, I've been away from here for three weeks.This Japanese sentence and its translation was provided by a native speaker, describing his absence from a website.What would be both the literal and figurative meanings of  空ける(あ.ける) here, in relation to time and/or the subject
I know what する means in terms of basic usage and obvious usage... I've been studying for a while so like, this isn't going to be a "What's 1 + 1" question hopefully.The question is to do with how する works with adverbial forms. What is the image you get in your head when someone says like 口にする or 気にする or ようにする or 下にする or 深くする. See I have trouble understanding how する should be envisioned. Is it the sense of doing towards that state represented by the adverb... or is it the sense of doing する in the way of that adverbFor example, 口にする seems to be like "DO WITH MOUTH" since it means both talk and eat but why not 口でする then if that's the case And 下にする is like.. different.. it doesn't feel like で but rather toward.... Are these two different に's or two different する'sI mean... think about Aにする... People often say like it means to "do towards A" but recently I realised it is short for B を A にする... So what is this する thing then Is it an action Is it a stand in for the flow of your life and how it progresses
http://kotobank.jp/word/%E6%8E%88%E6%A5%ADlist this word in one line so it doesn't seems like it should have lots of nuances. Here some usage in my textbook. 出席　してこそ、授業の意味があるのです。implies a sum of knowledge passed in class time.授業が終わるか終わらないかのうちに、彼は教室を出た。implies class-time. Is 授業　really defined so broadly What are the its limits of meaning and how to discrimate in practice www.jisho.org lists授業時間 as class-time, are there correct term for scheduled class-time and actual class-time I know from my time as an ALT in a Japanese high-school,  these are certainly not the same periods of time.
I am learning from 日本語総まとめ which is great generally but I wonder about this example from N2 文法　(grammar):子供がかわいいからこそ、しかるんです。which translates to I scold my children because I care for them. This was teaching こそ meaning because.Implying that が　かわいい　in this context means care for. Is this a true translation I thought it was something like 飼う　but  my teacher said it wasn't- just the cute, nice... meaning　adjective. Where is this usage referenced
In this Chiebukuro question about whether it should be ご心配無用 or 心配ご無用, one answerer says the following:「ご」とか「お」で丁寧とか尊敬とかを表す場合、  一番最後のものにだけつけておけば  全体にかかると言われているようです。  たとえば  「住所氏名年齢職業を”お”書きのうえ」とかです。  ご住所 おなまえ お歳 ご職業 などとは言わないそうです。Quick translation:When you add 「ご」 or 「お」 to show politeness/respect, if you just stick it on the last thing it will work on the whole sentence.  For example we say: 「住所氏名年齢職業をお書きのうえ」 rather than ご住所お名前お歳ご職業... This got me thinking about the topic of how many times to use 「お」 and 「ご」  in a sentence. For example, I've always wondered why it's not ご設定 in the following common train announcement:優先席付近では携帯電話の電源をお切り下さい。それ以外の場所では、マナーモードに設定の上、通話はお控え下さい。Similarly, on the buses where I live, it's:[...]マナーモードに設定の上、通話はご遠慮下さい。But, on the other hand, I've seen plenty of sentences like this before:電源をお切りいただくか、マナーモードにご設定の上、ご使用をお控えください。(source)So I want to ask:・Are there any prescriptive rules (from 文化庁 for example) that govern how many times to use 「お」「ご」 in a sentence・And how do people actually decide how many times to use 「お」「ご」 in a sentence
Google Translate  translates  「忘{わす}れたい女」 as  "Woman you want to forget".But it translates  「忘れたい人」　as  "People who want to forget".Is that a correct translation If so, why is thatShould it be  "People you want to forget"
There's a series that started airing where I live, 謎解きはディナーのあとで, and along with greatly enjoying the style, I've been very fascinated by the butler's very formal manner of speaking. What I never got, though, was what powers お忘れなきよう, which is what he says after telling his mistress about what the main lesson she needs to take with her is. Does anyone know Is it something along the lines of "Let us never speak of this again"
I'm a little confused as to the role that する is playing in phrases like はっきりとした and はっきりしている I know this is classed as a する verb, but it still doesn't make sense in the same way that nouns used with する do. How exactly do you translate these instances Any answers appreciated, thanks.
Which is found more often in common words, しょう or しょI tend to think しょう is found more often and is usually placed in the end of the word. On the contrary しょ seems to be placed at the start.  Are these assumptions correct
I have a sentence in my book like this:日本が　アメリカによく聞かれて困る質問の一つに、”How are you"　は　日本語で何と言うか、というのがある。and found a similar example here:アメリカでは大学への申込の手続きの一つに「なぜＸ大学に行きたいのか」ということに関してエッセイを書くというのがあります。The part I am confused about is the の一つに... in particular, the に part. Why are we placing a location particle next to 一つ... shouldn't it just be ｘの一つは　（Ｏｎｅ　ｏｆ　ｔｈｅ　Ｘ）
・時々ばかな事を話す  ・時々ばかな物事を話すI know the correct sentence is the former one, but both 事 and 物事 seem like "thing(s)".  Why is the latter incorrect What is the difference
Slightly mundane question here. Do negative verbs  translate as x "does not" do this action or simply "not" e.g　食べない "not eat" as opposed to "does not eat". The reason I ask is because On Tae kim's site all the verb examples are translated as "does not", When suddenly 買わない becomes "not buy" - which is it I know it's a silly a question, but I'm pretty curious, so I'd really appreciate any answers.
I am trying to translate the sentence in the title. Clearly,君に会うと、会いたくなくなる。seems to be wrong. Wouldn't this mean "When I see you, I would never want to see you again" or something like thatHow to say this simple sentence My brain is shortcircuiting for some reason...
I cannot grasp the meaning of と in the following sentence.俺はここ２年近く一人暮らしをしていたけど、料理が上手くなる事は無かったし、咲も必要が無い上に興味が向かないと料理はしなかった。Some sort of translation: "I've been living alone these 2 years, however I didn't become skilled in cooking, and Saki not only doesn't have any need in it, when she is not interest in it she does not cooking." Thank you very much for help.
Reading "プラチナデータ" by 東野圭吾.Not clear on the meaning of:"俺、何度も彼女を殺しそうになったもんな" - "I often almost killed her ... (monna)"What is "monna" I suppose "mono nara" ("if that thing"), but then I don't understand the whole sentence - is it "If I often almost killed her"
Many emails received from Japanese companies contain characters-based dingbat-style ornament like this:■□■□■□────────────────────────────  blablablablablablablabla  ────────────────────────────■□■□■□■blabla  ｜　bla：blablabla  ｜　bla：blabla■┓　　bla 　　┏■  ┗┛━━━━━━━━━━┗┛  ...It seems to be a particular case of Shift_JIS art (which I don't know how to say in Japanese either, by the way).What do you call this type of email decoration in Japanese
"この町に住ませて頂きたいんです。" is a line from a movie. That grammar makes sense to me. In this context, 使役形 is used to create a humble mood. (頂く) makes it even more humble.Based on that, today I said: "３年ぐらい、広島に住ませて頂きました。"I was told that is incorrect. In fact, this is correct: "3年ぐらい、広島に住ませてくれました。"This grammar confuses me.I feel that "この町に住ませて頂きたいんです。" should be sounded-out into passive voice: "I want to be forced to live in this town."However, I don't know how to sound-out "3年ぐらい、広島に住ませてくれました。" into passive voice By using 使役形 in this context, I am just pretending that someone has power over me (so as to humble myself). But, when I hear 「くれる」, I sense that the two parties must be specified (me and someone else). But, since I am just pretending there is someone with that power, there really is no one else.
Ok, still a newbie to Japanese. I've run across the word こと more and more recently. I'm having a hard time understanding what effect it's having on the sentence. For example, although I know the meaning of all the sentences below, I can't tell you what こと means or what it's doing to the sentence. Can someone give me some insight into its meaning Thanks. See examples below最初は国道を走りましたが、混んでいましたので、高速道路で行くことにしました。 First I took the National Road, but traffic was heavy, so we decided to take the subway.トラックを追い越すことは難しいです It’s hard to pass trucks.静岡辺りでスピード違反でパトカーに捉まってしまいました。すごい罰金を払うことになりました Around Shizuoka, we were stopped by a police car for speeding.

Recently, on another question, I left a comment where I said I thought １・２・３・４ might be pronounced イチニーサンヨン.  I was quickly corrected by another user, who said the following:AFAIK, 1,2,3,4 is usually read "ichi ni san shi"But a different user suggested that it depends on context:I'd say it depends on what 4 counts: E.g. １・２・３・４部屋 should be イチニーサンヨンヘヤThis left me unsure.  We do already have a couple questions discussing し versus よん:https://japanese.stackexchange.com/a/331/1478https://japanese.stackexchange.com/a/2365/1478Both of the answers I linked to discuss し and よん in terms of counting.  Specifically, they say that when counting up し is usual, and when counting down よん is usual.  And when I'm not counting, I usually read ４ as よん.  However, I'm not sure whether my example is "counting" or not!Here is the context I originally had in mind when I wrote １・２・３・４.  It's from a sample question for the Japanese Language Proficiency Test:____の言葉の読み方として最もよいものを、１・２・３・４から一つ選びなさい。Would ４ be read as し or よん in this context  Or could it be either one
I am a beginner Japanese student.

In Classical Japanese (correct me if I'm wrong; all my CJ was from Wikipedia and linguistic papers), the 已然形 could attach a lot of things: ど, ば, ども, etc. So I would be able to say 会へども話せず rather than 会うけれど話せないAnyways, where does the ker- part come from in all these supplanted forms of the 已然形 Is there once some helping 四段 verb ける If so, what would it mean
I'm interested in an exact translation of the particle まで used in this Internet meme:In case you can't read the image, here's a transcription:「えーマジ　童貞!」「キモーイ」「童貞が許されるのは小学生までだよねー」「キャハハハハハハ」Intuitively, the translation should be something like this:Only elementary school students are allowed to be virginsThis translation is backed by the translation of a variation of this phrase found on Touhou Wiki:イージ[sic]モードが許されるのは 小学生までだよねーThe only people allowed (to play) in easy mode are elementary school kids.However, according to the grammar guide and goo jisho, まで can only mean "even", not "only". Following a dictionary example:老人まで踊っているEven the elderly are dancing.I could try translating it as:Even elementary school students are allowed to be virgins ()But it does not sound right.Could it be that by saying "小学生まで" we imply "生まれた時から小学生まで"Only elementary school students and younger children are allowed to be virginsSo, how should まで be translated here and why

In a song by Monkey Majik (Together) it says 戦ぐ風に乗り光り輝く未来を, and a translation I read says this means grab the bright future. But I don't see anywhere in this sentences that necessarily implies grabbing. Any other suggestions
I just had someone say this to me. I'm pretty sure I know what it means already but I came here to confirm if I'm correct or not.こんにばんは is a combination of こんにちは and こんばんは.こんにちは is what you would say if you meet with someone for the first time or if you already know him/her, when you meet them while going about your daily business. こんばんは is similar, except said during the evening.こんにばんは is what you would say if you meet with someone new for the first time at night.Is my guess correct
Even though there is a katakana character ヷ, most of the time when I see something that is transcribed into Japanese as /va/, it is in the form ヴァ (say, for example, in the title of the anime series 革命機ヴァルヴレイヴ). Similarly, the forms ヸ, ヹ, and ヺ seem to be fairly rare too.I can somewhat understand the rationale for using ヴィ and ヴェ for ヸ and ヹ given that ヰ and ヱ are almost obsolete in the contemporary written standard, but ワ is still a very common sound.Is there a particular reason why the two-character form seems to be preferred over the single-character form
When you want to connect a 活用語 (inflectable word) to something else, generally you inflect it to the 連用形 (continuative form). However, with 形容詞 (i-adjectives), there are certain times where you affix things to the 語幹 (stem) as opposed to the 連用形.〜そう (Affixes to 連用形 for 動詞, but 語幹 for 形容詞.)動詞：　降りそう＝「降る」の連用形＋「そう」  形容詞：おいしそう＝「おいしい」の語幹＋「そう」〜すぎる (Affixes to 連用形 for 動詞, but 語幹 for 形容詞.)動詞：　食べすぎる＝「食べる」の連用形＋「すぎる」  形容詞：高すぎる＝「高い」の語幹＋「すぎる」My guess is that these suffixes want something "noun-like", and since the 連用形 of 形容詞 is adverbial, it doesn't work and instead the stem ended up serving that function.But, this is just a guess, so I'd like to know if anyone has a historical explanation of some of these things, or more examples to make that argument sound more convincing.
My current understanding is that 下りる means to go down, for example, 階段を下りる (Go down the stairs); while 降りる means to get off some form of transport, for example, 飛行機から降りる (Get off from the aeroplane).Is this understanding correct so farHowever, which one is used to "go down a mountain", and possibly other uses for going down
Is 許せ【ゆるせ】 something that's said  I heard from a friend that it is used to mean forgive me, but I find the use of the imperative in such a way to be strange.

Somewhat cryptic title, but a simple question.I start with the (logical) assumption that kanji makes writing Japanese shorter than using romaji. How shorter is it compared to English written in Latin script, on average For example, how many pages would an average 100 page book in English (Latin) have in Japanese (kanji+kana)Are there some studies concerning this topic

I read Chinese decently, so my friend asked me if I knew what their coin was for.From Chinese, I could read the kanji 金品 (Gold Commodity) and 交换 (Exchange), but not the Japanese. Can someone help me read what the purpose of this coin is for And then maybe I can make sense of the horse.Thanks!
"Personification" might be the term for adding 「人」or「者」as a suffix to a noun.I am pretty sure that 「化」can also function as a suffix to a noun. My perception is that adding 「化」as a suffix "injects action", and enables the newly formed noun to feel like gerunds and infinitives (which insert action into sentences via nouns), as well as function as a サ変名詞：「兵器」= "weapon"; 「兵器化する」= "to weaponize";「可視」= "visibility"; 「可視化する」= "to visualize";「コモディティー」= "commodity"; 「コモディティー化する」= "to commoditize";I am sure that there are many examples. They would be used in newspapers to make articles as short as possible(1) But, does the construct of "injecting action" with a「化」suffix really exist？(2) What are some websites that explain this(3) Is there a short phrase in English, or Japanese, that is used to identify this construct
I recently learnt that だれも means "everyone" with an affirmative verb and "no-one" with a negative verb. So, the literal translation of the Japanese "No-one is here" would be "Everyone is not here". Then how would one go about saying "Not everyone is here"
I sometimes find that songs liberally omit noun particles. As Japanese word order is somewhat free, this causes me to severely scratch my head. Song in question: https://www.youtube.com/watchv=YU4DkH77alwFor example, the first line:色　あせた　青ににじむ　白い雲　遠い　あの日　のいろ(with spaces where the singer pauses).There seems to be a huge amount of ways to parse this:色があせて、青に滲む。白い雲が遠い。あの日の色。色のあせた青に滲む。白い雲。遠いあの日の色。etc, etc. How would a Japanese person read this at first glance Is there some normative way to read case-unmarked Japanese
If 好き is a noun, then why does it take the な copula in things like 好きなこと I thought that copula was reserved for adjectives, and I thought nouns took on the の copula.

I understand both can mean "by means of, through, throughout", but I'm sure there's a difference in nuance here. Could someone help explain this
I know that なんて is a contraction of なんと, but has it also picked up the いう in its meaning Because なんて means something, and I feel like 何という, which means "something called" (right) could have just been reduced to なんて because saying "something" is such a common thing to say. Is this right
In English, "personification" is a literary device. But, I am talking about when you take a common noun, and then add 「人」、「者」、 or「家」:「労働」---&gt;「労働者」「案内」---&gt;「案内者」「日本」---&gt; 「日本人」「社会」 ---&gt;「社会人」「農業」---&gt; 「農業家」「投資」---&gt; 「投資家」  (1) Is there a generalized rule / guidance for knowing which nouns can be personified, and which suffix to choose   (2) When studying Japanese grammar in English, is "personification" the correct technical term The term "personification" when applied to English writing is completely different.note: Sometimes, I arbitrarily say 「＿じん」 or 「＿しゃ」 instead of 「＿の人」 without knowing if it is really a word. If the overall context is clear, most Japanese have no problem understanding what I mean. Does anyone else do this, or something similar with other suffixes
In English, "thanks anyway" is a common way of acknowledging the other person's effort/attention even though the end result wasn't satisfactory to the person doing the thanking.For example:Thankee: Here, have a piece of cake that I made.Thanker: I'm afraid this cake isn't really edible at this point in time. throws cake in the bin Thanks anyway (for the effort in making the cake).Thanker: Hi, I would like to buy your Item X but only if it comes with Item Y. Do you have Item Y as well Item XThankee: Sorry, we don't have Item Y in stock at the moment.Thanker: Damn it. Thanks anyway (for checking for me).Is there a Japanese equivalent The closest I can find is でも、ありがとう but that's not as succinct as "thanks anyway" because I have to insert a sentence before it (I'm afraid this cake isn't really edible. でも、ありがとう).
～ことにする　ｖｓ　～ことにした～と思う　ｖｓ　～と思ったWhat sort of context would you use either of these Does the past tense imply that you've changed your decisions or thoughts

In Japanese, some names exist in both people and prefectures or cities. For example, Fukushima Industries Corporation is not named after the prefecture of Fukushima (福島県) or the city, but after Nobuo Fukushima (福島　裕).Which comes first Is it that there's the name of a city or prefecture, and people who live there get their name from it, or was the city or prefecture named after someone famous Or both
I was wondering if someone could explain the difference between 働くvs 勤める. They seem to both be used to indicate work. As in "I work at Nasa" or something like that. But they have different pronunciations and slightly different kanji. Is there a difference in usage When would I use one vs the other.Thank you in advance.
Can one use ことにする to express the idea "A decides that B will do X"Take the sentence 私は外へ出ることにした. The way I see it, 私 is the subject of both 出る and した, with one usage omitted due to being understood. So in full the sentence is私は｛私が外へ出る｝ことにした。  I decided to go outside.Now what happens if the subjects are different Can we sayAはBが外へ出ることにした。  A decided that B would go outside.If this construction is not allowed, how else could you say this
A friend of mine told me that he heard うくれ or 受けれ was slang for funny (He said it was suppose to be "we accept"). I don't really know much more that that so I'm having trouble finding it online-does anyone have ideas what it could have been
I just realized today that for some reason I'm pretty uncomfortable with things like そう思う because the Japanese そう has a meaning akin to saying isn't that so in English. But when you say そう思う, そう is being treated as what's being thought, right So is it more appropriate to say そうと思う？Because it is the subject in this case, right
I'm curious why many English words that are borrowed into Japanese which have the "ca" sound as in "can" or "canvas" end up with that being mapped to キャ:キャンバス (canvas)キャビネット (cabinet)キャンセル (cancel)キャンピング (camping)キャメラ (camera)...Gya also:ギャラリー (gallery)ギャラクシー (galaxy)also, not at the start of a word:スキャン　(scan)スキャンダル (scandal)(and why is 缶 かん rather than きゃん).The kya sound doesn't resemble the original in any major English dialects. It's not hard to pick up the intuition for it, but is there a linguistic explanationDoes this choice help to avoid some ambiguity with native morphemes, essentially flagging these words as being loanwords  There don't seem to be very many native words that start with kya; a large number of them are compounds of 客, so these prefixes do seem to occupy a sparsely populated space.
I'm confused in ように in the following sentence. Maybe it connects to 聞こえる or maybe means "in order to"  I'm not sure about it here. Some sort of translation:"Conversations in this period of time means, that they are taking the opportunity to clear the gloom from exams studying, the fact that it sounds a bit unnatural maybe is my imagination."この時期の会話というのは、受験勉強の鬱屈【うっ・くつ】をここぞとばかりに晴らそうとするように、妙にキンキンと聞こえるのは気のせいだろうか。
I stumbled upon the following sentence:言いだしっぺとして、10人がんばります！Context: a person is told to invite 10 persons, and seems to answer "言いだしっぺとして, I will try my best to get 10 persons!"What does the 言いだしっぺとして part meanWhat nuance does it bring to the sentence, compared to a simple "10人がんばります！"
Here's the definition of sudoku in Wikipedia:数独（すうどく）とは、3×3のブロックに区切られた 9×9の正方形の枠内に1〜9までの数字を入れるペンシルパズルの一つである。 How should one read 9×9の or 3×3の out loud
I just came a across the word 「お巡りさん」。While 「お巡り」 is a word, 「巡り」 is not. Likewise, 「ご飯」 is a word, but while 「飯」is a word, the reading changes to the 訓読み (めし)。This means that the 「ご」in「ご飯」is not window-dressing 美化語. The「ご」in「ご飯」is a necessary part of the word. In my opinion, 「お茶」 is in limbo. I've never heard 「茶」 spoken without an honorific 「お」、but 「茶」alone is officially in my dictionary。  Over time, 「お」or「ご」can become a necessary part of some words, right Is this a documented part of Japanese grammar (reference links would be welcomed). What are a few more words that have an honorific prefix, 「お」or「ご」, as a necessary part
There's a sentence in my textbook.子供の時から今までを振り返って男あるいは女に生まれて、Ａよかったと思った／思うこと、Ｂ嫌いだと思った／思うこと、を三つずつ書いてください男あるいは女に生まれて、 This is the part in particular I don't understand... I read it as... "Born by a man, or possibly a woman..." Why would it say that Is it supposed to be read "Born AS a man or possibly a woman"Don't tell me that 女に生まれる has two meanings!!! It means born by right に is supposed to be actor of the passive action right Like 巨人に食べられた。... Or am I somehow wrong.
A sentence from JapanesePod 101:米は、多くの食事で、重要な糖質源になっている。  Rice is an important source of carbohydrates in many diets.The になっている seems unnecessary here. Could one simply end the sentence with 糖質源だ without changing the meaning i.e.米は、多くの食事で、重要な糖質源だ。
In The Global Soul: Pico Iyer, (disclaimer: the depiction of Japan may be offensive) Iyer says:Rather perversely I live in Japan, which, as you know, is the most  alien science fiction place on earth for those of us from other  countries.When you get there they read from right to left and back to front.So far, I've only experienced horizontal writing being from left to right. I've heard that vertical writing is top to bottom, and the next column is on your left, though I've never tried reading any vertical text with more than one column.Wikipedia states that when there's only one row of text, writing in columns consisting of a single letter can result in text going from right to left.Are there any other cases where Japanese reads from right to left
What is the the difference between どこでも vs. どこにでも vs. どこも I thought どこでも was anywhere, どこにでも was everywhere, and どこも was also everywhere... but then I didn't know what the difference would be between the latter two.
ぬかるむ has the definition of "to be muddy" in my dictionary, but it is a verb. Furthermore, all the examples use it before a noun, as opposed to saying 丘はぬかるむ. Is it correct to say this Why is ぬかるむ a verb, and not an adjective, or rather can someone explain the possible mentality that went into ascribing the characteristic of being muddy to being a verb as opposed to an adjective
I was watching My Boss My Hero, and I could have sworn he said わかね instead of わからない. Is this feasible Is there some dialect that drops off ない for ね
This question already has an answer here:                                            What is the meaning of りゃ in this phrase                                (1 answer)                            Closed 6 years ago.I was listening to Hikawa Kiyoshi's ソーラン節 and instead of 浴びる he said 浴びりゃ， is there a normal pattern for this kind of pronunciation Is it regional
I read that 浴びる is a transitive verb, but if it means to clean, then shouldn't it's object be what's be washed The examples I see have the object of the verb as what one is using to wash with or bathe in, e.g. water, sunshine.
Recently I've found several versions of Soran Bushi, and this puzzles me-I don't understand why it would be different in different places. Moreover, I don't understand some of the vocabulary in it: 声を嗄れよと　唄声上げて しわがれる is to become hoarse, should it be よう and が instead of を？   腕もちぎれよ　舞姿　チョイちぎれる is to be torn Again what is the よ？ Volitional formヤサエ　エンヤ－  ねじりハチマキ　長袢天は What does ながばんてん mean踊れ踊れと　ソーラン節よ れ-is this imperativeオラが多喜雄のソーラン節はIs オラ suppose to be the I-pronoun今じゃ北海道の　南中節よ  ヤサエ　エンヤ－  サーノドッコイショ　  Now that I look at the last part, it seems like this is a remake of Soran Bushi, but I don't know why it's the most popular on the English Youtube then. Also, even with respect to the "normal" Soran Bushi, I have yet to be able to find a consistent ordering of the verses.Lastly, what does ソーラン　mean
I am trying to understand the following clearly:私のこと私のもの私のやつWhen someone is talking about us, we can use こと.いいえ、それは私のことではないですNo, that is not something related to me.やつ is used when we talk about something physical like a bag, book, etc例 これはあなたの財布ですか？ いいえ、私のやつではないです。I am not sure on how to use わたしのものCould someone clarify
Consider the following words:燦々 sansan散々 sanzanBoth of them are formed via the reduplication of san, but the latter word has the second instance voiced, while the former doesn't. Was there some sort of historical phonological rule that governed whether or not the second syllable would be voiced, or is this property of reduplicated words unpredictable a priori
I have a question about the に particle.I was never told that it was possible to do something like this:私は妹に新しいおもちゃを買いました。I thought you HAD to say 私は妹のために新しいおもちゃを買いました。よい子【こ】になるには早寝【はやね】早起【はやおき】するコトです。How come に is used with a verb here like なるにIs that possible tooHow often am I allowed to do that
どういたしまして 【どう致しまして · 如何致しまして】you are welcome;  don't mention it;  not at all;  my pleasure;  —Usually written using kana alone.「手伝ってくれてありがとう」「どういたしまして」 "Thank you for your help." "It's my pleasure."「ありがとうご座います」「どう致しまして」 "Thank you." "You are welcome". (致す  ita.su = doth;  do;  send;  forward;  cause;  exert;  incur;  engage)如何 (どう) dou  (adverb):  how;  in what way;  how about;  —Usually written using kana alone.How do the two words come together to mean, "you're welcome."Is it an abbreviation of an older phrase
In my Japanese Bible, I've seen several passages that use the phrase かの日.  Here are a couple.ある人たちの習慣に倣【なら】って集会を怠【なまけ】ったりせず、むしろ励【はげ】まし合いましょう。かの日が近づいているのをあなたがたは知っているのですから、ますます励【はげ】まし合おうではありませんか。　－　ヘブライ人への手紙 / 10章 25節かの日には、大勢の者がわたしに、『主よ、主よ、わたしたちは御名【み・な】によって預言【よ・げん】し、御名【み・な】によって悪霊【あく・りょう】を追い出し、御名【み・な】によって奇跡をいろいろ行ったではありませんか』と言うであろう。 　－　マタイによる福音書【ふく・いん・しょ】 / 7章 22節かの日、主が来られるとき、主は御自分の聖なる者たちの間であがめられ、また、すべて信じる者たちの間でほめたたえられるのです。それは、あなたがたがわたしたちのもたらした証【あか】しを信じたからです。 　－　テサロニケの信徒への手紙二 / 1章 10節I haven't been able to find the exact phrase in any dictionary.  The best I can theorize is that it is 彼【か】の, which is basically the same as その or あの.  So it would be something like "On that day..."Is this correct  If so, is it some literary term  What advantage does it have over その or あの  If not (correct), what is it
I thought if you say "I don't smoke cigarettes" that would be "[Watashi wa] tabako o suimasen". But I just saw something that said it would be "tabako wa suimasen". Are they interchangable Is there a difference
Closed. This question is off-topic. It is not currently accepting answers.                                            Want to improve this question Update the question so it's on-topic for Japanese Language Stack Exchange.                Closed 7 years ago.                        Improve this question                    In a recent post titled "Kanji identification" the accepted answer stated that the "parts" for 「烙」 are "fire", "folding chair" and "mouth". Japanese native speakers don't understand what that means. Likewise, I don't understand.  An answer that is not understandable by native speakers seems a little weird. Japanese people memorize very, very, few radicals. What they memorize is the official name (so as to explain verbally how to write a kanji). The "meaning" is ancillary at best. Can someone elaborate to me why a radical discussion answered the question in the "Kanji identification" thread In this forum, I read most questions / answers to learn Japanese.
I am trying to understand the dialogue 5:03 in this tutorial video.What I'm hearing is this:なにがいますか。なにもいませんね。あれ。ねこがいますよ。え、どこに？あそこにいますよ。The lesson is about how to say that something is somewhere and the differences between います/あります。 So the video goes on to explain the last three sentences.The first sentence, I think, means something like: "Who's/what's there". However, I don't understand that the second means. I know も is used for "also", so all I came up with was the nonsensicalWhat too isn't there, is therePlease help :)
The full sentence is:気にしないでコレ全然アレじゃねぇから  間違ってもチクんじゃねーぞAnd I'm having trouble deciphering those katakana, コレ and アレ are probably a way to emphasize これ and あれ, but what about チク Is it replacing a kanji

Here's a sentence I found:デパートはどこにあるか、知っていますか？  Do you know where the department store isWhat's the purpose of the か particle in 「どこにあるか」 Under what circumstances do I use itI'm fairly sure it's not the か that's normally used to form questions, like the second か in that sentence, nor is it the か that means “or.”
What does the Kanji next to the bar at the bottom right hand side of the screen mean in this video (The small bar, not the larger one): http://youtu.be/qIKNRmdEx5Et=20s - The bar that it's next to is a curse (or fever) meter, though I had looked up both of these words previously and this kanji didn't ever seem to appear.

The class I go to uses the «Minna no Nihongo» textbook, and according to it you can say the following in informal language:そのカレーライスおいしい？わたしは富士山にのぼりたい。(See book 1, lesson 20)So I gathered, the copula can be omitted in adjective-like predicates. However, when I posted on Lang-8 applying the new-found knowledge, people corrected me:ドイツはいちども行ったことがないから、ずっと行きたかった行きたかったんだ or 行きたかったです。Hence, the question: why だ／です is necessary here What's the general rule
I have the following sentence: [仕事]{しごと}で[気]{き}を[遣]{つか}うことが[多]{おお}い. Which directly translates to：　at work you use your 気 often. Some other translations of ki wotsukau include, paying attention to others, caring about something, to attend to, to fuss about, to take into consideration.My question is what is the nuance of this き. Is it a good thing or is it a bad thing. Imagine you have to agree or disagree with the statement. What is the suggested meaning implied by these responses.I've read in other works where 気を遣う is not really a good thing, like it is taking away at the core of your energy and you couldn't maintain some situation, essentially because that situation is using your き. However, in the translations above it also seems like the statement is saying, you often care about your work. The significance here is that ones response of agreeing or disagreeing to the sentence, has almost exact opposite meanings depending on the interpretation of the sentence. I feel the key to understanding the sentence is in the nuance...Cheers.Finally, I would be happy if someone could edit/add tags so I can better understand what this question should be tagged as, thanks.

From what I know ending verb in え makes it sound rough and very casual. I checked in tangorin.com online dictionary - it's said there it is actually a noun. To me, though, it looks like a rough intransitive version of 止まる.Why 止まれ
I'm trying to translate a sentence containing "which one of you" into Japanese, like in "Which one of you took my sandwich".Google's search bar was no help - a query for "which one of you" in Japanese gave me あなたのその1, which seems to mean "the first of you", and the page results were all for results that simply contained "which one of you" and "Japanese" on the same page.It seems like it would be something like "あなたたちにどの人" (which person among you), but as I'm not experienced, I don't know if that's the correct form.I don't want something as general as "誰" (who), because I want to refer to a specific group of people.
似てるよ、ユーマくんと初めて出会って時と。I'm slightly confused at how と is used at the end.
I read an article (http://www.gizmodo.jp/2013/10/post_13267.html, in case anyone is interested), and it got me thinking how a Japanese person would read this passage:ここの水は水素イオン指数pH 9～10.5。Do they pronounce the pH And what about the numbers Is it just something like きゅう、じゅう　てん　ご　ぐらい？Or is there some kind of suffixThanks!
I saw a native Japanese speaker post this on Twitter, I believe that おやすみ means vacation or holiday, but I was unable to figure out the phrase from the context.
I am confused by 「二番」vs.「二番目」、「三番」vs.「三番目」etc.While 「一番速い人。」 seems grammatically correct and  sounds ok to me, 「二番速い人。」 sounds so unnatural to me I am thinking the grammar might be wrong. But, if 「一番速い」 is correct, certainly 「二番速い」 must also correct, right  With regard to modifying nouns with adjectives such as "second", "third", etc. this is how I've heard it done:「それは、二番目に高い建物です。」「三番目の好きな日本料理はお好み焼きです。」「四番目に速い人は、田中さんです。」...  Personally, but for 「一番」、 I never just say 「＿番」. I say 「＿番目」. But in forums such as this, I observe 「＿番」 used more often than 「＿番目」。 So, I am getting worried / confused about this.Also, in this context. 「目」 must be consider a counter right It is the counter of positions in an ordered list. If it's not officially a counter, what is it
Here's the sentence that I was listening to: Kono shorui ni Yan-san no juusho, shimei, seinengappi nado o kakikonde kudasai. When I was listening to it, it sounded like the word was being pronounced as: kakonde. Obviously, I didn't hear the i or ki. But still is the i silent or am I not just hearing it rightSecondary questions: 1) why shimei and not namae 2) what is the konde in kakikondehttp://youtu.be/qBh5ru-4AHwt=10m16s
According to Wiktionary, the only conjugation I can match this to is the conjunctive form, but that doesn't make any sense, given the context (as in "Help me!"). What would the equivalent conjugation of other verbs be here(Note: my background is perhaps equivalent to 1/2-year's worth of Japanese, gleaned through osmosis via animes and some books.)
I'm looking to test some Morphological Analysis tools, which split sentences into tokens and provide part of speech and pronunciation information (specifically, providing kana when given kanji). I'm after some sentences which automated tools would have trouble with. Examples of what I'm after are sentences which are difficult to determine the word boundaries, pronunciation or part of speech. Preferably, examples would be a more correct interpretation, and be something that could be seen in actual use.The best I have found so far is "私はあくまで執事ですから". In a similar vain, is "にわにはにわとりがいる (庭には二羽鶏が居る)" which only applies to spoken use. An english example might be something like "Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo", which is difficult to determine the part of speech each word is.
Let's say there is a 1km race, and here is the ranking:A: 170 secondsB: 301 secondsC: 308 secondsD: 312 secondsWe can say that A is fastest by a wide margin, because he was much faster than all other runners.How to say fastest by a large margin in JapaneseAdapting from ALC, I wrote 大幅に一番速い, but a Japanese colleague taught me that 大幅 and 一番 can not be used at the same time. She advised me to use only one or the other, but I feel that the idea I want to convey (much faster than all others) is lost.
I am reading the sentence... 他人に自分の内面を見られたくない人もいるのではないだろうか　and wondering why it seems like there is a double negative that I'm not seeingもいる = +のではない = -だろう = END RESULT = ＋だろうか has to be - rightDoes it have anything to do with what I've been told about だろう being formed from a　未然形 form and some sort of う particle Is there such thing as an う particle Apparantly it is a particle concerned with guessing...Anyway long story short I cannot parse the above sentence since the positives and negatives don't add up... please help.
I was reading the examples from the book 日本語文型辞典 and I came across this example sentence which I have absolutely no idea of how to parse it:その子は、人と目が合うたびにやさしく笑いかけるような、そんな、人を疑うということを知らないような子だったと言う。Is the first ような (笑いかけるような) modifying 子, as well as the second And what is this そんな doing between commasThanks!
So I asked some Japanese guy if he really meant something (about speaking in certain language) with 本当ですか and I got this as an answer:実はしゃべれるわけじゃなかったりするI understand what わけではない means, but what's with that り How to properly translate this sentence
I'd thought you cannot end a sentence with a noun. Rather:noun + だ。noun + です。noun + である。noun + であります。noun + でございます。But in a movie dialogue, I heard: "大切なのは、心よ。"Ending a sentence with a noun sounds weird. In every situation, I add "です" (or でございます). But, what is "よ" a 助詞？Does it effect whether to voice the "です"
I'd like help with this passage.It is from the workbook 日本語総まとめN2:「もちろん、試合前の練習や表情、試合後の様子などを知りたくないなどというつもりはありませんが、なるべく試合だけに集中できるよう、ファンへのサービスに気をつかわなくてもいいようにそっとしてあげられたら、と思わずにはいられないのです。」The first part seems clear to me: "It's not that I don't wanna know about the conditions before or after the game or anything" (Rough Translation). The second part is what baffles me. In my understanding, the person is saying that he cannot help imagining it would be good () if he could let the players know they don't have to worry about fan service in order to focus on the game as much as possible. Is that, to some extent, correct If not, what would be the meaning of this structure, to be more specific, what is the meaning of:ようにそっとする.I know そっとする means roughly 'leave alone', but I've tried searching for examples of it in combinations with ように and couldn't find any samples.And also, what nuance does たらと思います bring
I am having a little trouble understanding the nuance of でしょうか in comparison to ですか.  People say it makes it more hesitant and polite, but that doesn't explain the nuance enough for me.Why would you say the line below あなたは「自分ってどんな人？」と聞かれたら、どのように答えるでしょうか. I don't understand what nuance でしょうか has - does it place the uncertainty on the listener like “how do you suppose you answer” as opposed to “how do you answer”That's my guess, but I need to understand the nuance. If there is no difference in meaning between one and the other I will never alter them.
My dictionary lists both 辞書{じしょ} and 字引{じびき} as simply, "Dictionary." On tatoeba.org I can only find example sentences of 字引 where it is used in the phrase:生き字引 = A walking dictionaryExample:僕の父は、いわば生き字引だ。My father is, so to speak, a walking dictionary.Is 字引 used in any other situationDoes 字引 have connotations that 辞書 does not
ごくろうさん  gokurousan   【ご苦労さん · 御苦労さん】expression meaning:  I appreciate your effortsアリさん、今日もご苦労さんだよ。はい、角砂糖あげるよ。 Hi Mr Ant, keeping up the good work today as well. Here's a sugar cube.ご is the honorific, 苦労 means trouble or hardships, but does the さん have the same meaning of さま when it means "state"
Lately my ears started catching words ending in り that seem like nouns created from verbs. I'm sorry I don't have any other examples besides the one from the title 始まる (to start) -&gt; 始まり (the start).Is it just a small number of word pairs like that or there is some magic grammar formula to produce such nounsありがとうございます！
The motivation for this question is the phrase 本法廷 which I recently read. Does ほん (本) work as a general purpose prefix By this I mean can I look in the dictionary and pick any noun and put 本 in front and have a grammatically correct phrase When it acts as a prefix, can it always mean either 'this' or 'true' depending on context If it is a prefix to a word starting with h-, is rendaku applied to make it start with p- For example is 本法廷 ほんほうてい or ほうぽうてい？
What exactly does 〜ておきます mean in this context旅行{りょこう}する前{まえ}にホテルを予約{よやく}しておきます。Is this trying to say something like "Before traveling, reserve a room". Is this a suggestion An order (If so, why aren't they using ください at the end instead of おきます)
There are several words that have a common etymological origin but are sometimes pronounced with a 'b' and sometimes with an 'm'. Here are some examples:おもえる、おぼえる　（思える、覚える）さむらい、さぶらい　（侍）ぶ、む　（無）ばく、まく　（幕）ば　（馬）There are many more examples. For 馬, I'm almost certain it is pronounced with an 'm' initial in every dialect of Chinese but its onyomi has a 'b'. Is there a reason why these two similar, yet definitely distinct, consonants are related in this way
In English, the geographical scope of "Asia" and "Asian" depends on which dialect of English you speak. For example, in British English the terms often refer to the Indian subcontinent, whereas in Australian English "Asia" and especially "Asian" would often refer to China, Japan, and south-east Asia.What geographical scope does アジア or アジア人 encompassI had a look at the Wikipedia article on アジア, but it seemed to talk about the worldwide view of what Asia is, and didn't talk specifically about the Japanese-language definition.
I've never actually played a sudoku puzzle (I know, I live in a cave!).I just saw the word written in kanji somewhere, which rekindled my interest.Wikipedia states:The puzzle was popularized in 1986 by the Japanese puzzle company  Nikoli, under the name Sudoku, meaning single number.Though to me, the compound 数独{すうどく} implies "number addiction", especially in the context of a game.
I'd like to say “Tomorrow is Monday”. Is it correct for me to say 「あしただげつようび」 Or is there simply no particle at all
Many English words have their definitions change depending on their parts of speech:"type" (noun) = classification of something. (verb) = to peck-away as a keyboard."blue" (noun) = a color. (adj) = depressed, melancholy....But, in the case of Japanese、are there any nouns that can also function as another part of speech サ変動詞 do not count.
Does anybody know what べた打ち　means, and what the kanji for べた could be The context I heard it in was the upright playing style of taiko.
How to call it when a vehicle that just passed you gets back in lane too early, forcing you to brake, or even causing an accidentSee this Diagram.This can also happen when a vehicle overtakes and then decide to turn very soon afterwards, cutting your way.In French it is called queue de poisson.It is DIFFERENT from "fishtail". Fishtail is when a vehicle loses control due to an obstacle, "queue de poisson" usually does not involve losing control, just braking in a straight line, in most cases. Fishtail can be had alone, "queue de poisson" can't happen with less than 2 vehicles.
So my name is written Anibal, I'm from Brazil, just so you know.I'd like to know how would you write it in japanese, I'm in doubt between A-ni-ba-ru and A-ni-ba-e-ru. Any further explanation would be much appreciated.

The languages of oriental Buddhist traditions, be it Theravada or Mahayana, do not always provide complete and entire canonical texts.Up to now, I am aware of Pali, Chinese and Tibetan versions of Buddhist canonical texts only.My knowledge is not perfect, so can someone help me and shed some light on the situation with Buddhist canon in Japanese Sorry for my question being so ugly set.Has a complete translation of Buddhist canon into Japanese been ever made Does a Buddhist canon in Japanese exist as a part of Japanese cultural context (just like the aforementioned canons in their respective cultural areas)If so, what is its writing system and to which degree does the language of canon differ from its modern Japanese version

「臭う」 and 「臭いがする」 have the same meaning, but can this be generalizeaccording to google:臭いがする (49-m hits); 話しがする (17-m hits); 笑いがする (31-m hits); 踊りがする (5-m hits); ...But, a Japanese scholar told me that, except for 「臭いがする」、"verb stem" + がするis incorrect grammar. I am not convinced. Can someone help me sort this out To start with, I bet that the verb must be intransitive.
My Japanese teacher told me there is no shorter way to say 自動販売機{じどうはんばいき}. However, I found 自販機{じはんき} in my dictionary. Does a word (including slang) for "vending machine" shorter than four morae exist
私は山田さんから本を借りました。私は山田さんに本を借りました。(I borrowed a book from Yamada-san.)Is it ok to use から or do I have to use に
I have come across the following in a piece of fiction (「永遠のジャック＆ベティ」, by 清水{しみず}義範{よしのり}):「今日は上着を着ているためには暑すぎます」◯◯するには☓☓すぎる。つまり、暑くて上着なんか着ていられない、という意味だった。As you can see, the bolded sentence is presented as an example of a Japanese sentence structure, with the ◯◯ and ☓☓ standing in for two arbitrary 動詞 (or 形容詞 or 形容動詞, I guess). It is part of the running prose (i.e. not dialogue), so no character in the story actually speaks it.How do you read this aloud, though My first instinct is to read it as 「マルマルするにはバツバツすぎる」, but this seems kind of weird to me. I've seen マル used a lot as a placeholder, but バツ seems to carry with it a meaning of "wrong" or "incorrect" and doesn't seem like a neutral placeholder.EDIT: My professor claims that it is incorrect to read both the ◯◯ and the ☓☓ above identically (as なになに), because then you lose the fact that the ◯◯ and ☓☓ can (and perhaps should) be distinct lexical items. In light of this, I have provisonally unaccepted @tdes's answer and am now hoping for answers with some sort of authoritative citation.
In a video that snailboat pointed out in a comment on my question about geminated /r/, at least one speaker of Japanese sounds to me like they trill both the /r/s in タリアテッレ. It's my understanding that, most of the time, /r/ in Japanese is a flap that freely varies between central and lateral (cf. the answer to R sound vs L sound). For /r/ to transform into a trill, then, is really quite surprising. In what contexts (social, dialectal, grammatical, whatever) does /r/ become a trillI know that /r/ manifests as a trill (巻き舌) in yakuza speech (cf. What are the stereotypical characteristics of yakuza speech); where else do we find trilled /r/(Note: I may just be mishearing the speaker in the Youtube video linked above; if so, just ignore that part. Either way, my question about trilled /r/ in Japanese remains.)
話者の希望・意向を表す文や働きかけの文は来ない。This is a case when interpoint (中黒) is used for listing like a conjunction.I wonder how would a native speaker pronounce such an expressionSimply きぼういこうきぼう (pause) いこうor きぼうといこう, きぼうやいこう, i.e. inserting some context-appropriate conjunction word between items.
So I was watching 女が階段を上る時 by Mikio Naruse late at night, and heard something that sounded familiar. Alas, I fell asleep and returned the movie before checking (yes there is still a rental store in my hood).Anyway, in the movie a hostess from a rival club walks into a bar, and receives the 『いらっしゃい！』greeting. However, I remember hearing her respond to the greeting with another set phrase that sounded familiar yet was one I haven't learned. Does anyone know if there is set response to 『いらっしゃい！』 I think I might have heard it in another old movie before, but not irl.Edit; the character say ごくろうさん, but this is not a phrase with a specific relation to  『いらっしゃい！』. Thanks, all!
I'm confused about 「に作られた」 in the following sentence. Kindly explain this part to me. 「Central Base」とは、旧「アクアポリス・中央エアポート」に作られた、「ASDF」の陸上（？）基地のことだ。Some sort of translation: Central base is, created by the old Aquapolice - Central airport, ASDF's land() base.Central base is, created on the old Aquapolice - Central airport, ASDF's land() base. (However in this case I think that で would be more suitable)The "（？）" is part of the original text.
This is my current understanding of gemination (促音, /Q/, small っ): in native Japanese words, only the following sounds can be geminated: /k/, /s/, /t/, /p/. Additionally, in loanwords we can geminate their voiced counterparts /g/, /z/, /d/, /b/. German loans also give us geminatable /h/. (Separately, we also have moraic /N/, which can precede /n/; and place assimilation of /N/ -&gt; /m/ before /m/.)This is all well and good, but today I learned that the loanword for "tagliatelle" is written タリアテッレ, with a geminated /r/. How do you geminate Japanese /r/, which is (at least in my idiolect) a central flap, which doesn't seem to lend itself to geminationBy contrast, English /r/ is an approximant and Spanish /r/ is a trill, so it's clear how those geminate (just pronounce them for double the usual length), and similarly, all the other geminatable Japanese sounds are stops or fricatives, which also have an obvious way of geminating them.Audio of a native speaker pronouncing geminated-/r/ words would be very helpful as part of an answer.
So, 美化語 is used to create honorifics:お名前ご注文etc.But, the standard way to create the 謙譲語 form of verbs is:お＋[verb stem] + いたしますThat does not make logical sense to modify the action that you are performing with an honorific "お", right There is nothing about this paradox that would help with understanding 敬語 in a broader context。Every language has its idiosyncrasies. Assigning 美化語 to action you perform is just something to memorize, right I don't care about etymology. So, memorize and move on to the next topic
As I read 「ノルウェイの森」 by 村上春樹, I noticed some words that are probably mistyped.しかしそのおかけでクラスの中で僕の立場はもっと孤立したものになった。Shouldn't it be そのおかげでA few more examples:「...」と彼は黒いボストン・バックに衣類やノートを詰めこみながら言った。バッグ =&gt; バック (no dakuten)そしてそんなことを考えれば考えるほど僕の体は余計に飢え、そしで乾いた。そして =&gt; そしで (extra dakuten)彼にとつてはそれはただのゲームにすぎないのだ。とって =&gt; とつて (っ grows up to つ, this is another kind of transformation, but I'm not sure if I should create a separate question for it)Are these words just misprinted or they are used correctly
I am just learning about the も　particle and the textbook has examples like this:やまださんはがくせいです。わたしもがくせいです。  Yamada is a student. I am also a student.I am wondering whether the repetition of　がくせいです　is really necessary. Can I say something like:やまださんはがくせいです。わたしもです。or maybeやまださんはがくせいです。わたしも。The other question is whether も works with negative statements too. I.e. will the following be grammaticalやまださんはせんせいではありません。わたしもせんせいではありません。And the similar question of the possible contraction of this. Can I sayやまださんはせんせいではありません。　わたしもではありません。Can I make it even shorter to say "Neither am I"
I've heard a friend say that the Ainu word for every part of the human body is monosyllabic, and that all words in Ainu are made up of the syllables from those words. Is either claim true
When using そばから in the sense of "as soon as", everything I find says that you can use either た form/past tense before it, or dictionary form, but not what the difference is. Sometimes people even use both forms in the same sentence:我が家もそうなのだけれど、片付けるそばから散らかすし拭いたそばからこぼされる。So is there any difference in nuance between these片付けるそばから散らかす片付けたそばから散らかす片付けてるそばから散らかす
I'm currently listening to 「愛国行進曲」, which is apparently a Shōwa-era patriotic song. It is written in a rather confusing mix of modern and Classical Japanese, but I think I can understand most of it except for 「往{ゆ}け八紘を宇{いえ}となし」. What is となし Is it と無し That doesn't seem to make any sense...
A friend of mine recently translated a Japanese article from Japan's October issue of An An magazine and sent her a tweet in English telling her that it was completed. The author replied with the following tweet: (^з^)-☆ ばI have only been studying Japanese online for less than a year, and can't make any sense of her response.  When I look it up in the Japanese to English dictionary, it refers to location, which doesn't make sense.Can anyone help
I've always compared な adjectives to some abstract harder type of adjective, and I think I learned formally what the difference is, kind of, but I've forgotten. In any case, I know there are nouns that can act as adjectives, but what is the reason for why な adjectives are used in forms like 大切だと思う, similar to nouns With other adjectives だ is omitted, so what exactly does the だ mean in this case What part of speech is it
Dictionaries have 「たくさん」 listed as being either a noun or 形容動詞。Googling "たくさんな" returns only 190,000 hits; none of the top 20 pages are professional websites. Rather, they are only blogs.My impression is that, practically speaking, 「たくさん」 is used only as a noun For some idiosyncratic reason, it's also listed as 形容動詞 Can anyone shed some light as to what's going on Is this issue related to the meaning of 形容動詞、or just about that the word, 「たくさん」, is exceptional。thanks.
what are the Japanese, and English, technical terms for these verb transforms:読める、買える、書ける、...and this:読まれる、買われる、書かれる、...and this:読ませる、買わせる、書かせる、...Is there a standard term that textbooks use to call the changing of verb stems into those 3 different forms "Verb conjugation" sounds natural, however "conjugate" does not sound correct in the context.What do Japanese students call the changing of verbs into those 3 different forms thanks.
A sentence from Kanji in Context:人にはそれぞれ長短があって、それで世の中はうまくいくようにできているのです。I get that it means something like everyone has individual strengths and weaknesses, and thus the world can go smoothly. But what does ようにできる mean here Is it being used as the potential form of ようにする, i.e. the world can be made to go smoothly
人と比べるのではなく、過去の自分と比べる。  Do not compare yourself to other people, compare yourself to your past self.Without any change in meaning, (though I guess it would be less formal in tone), could the writer have just used the -ない form of 比べる instead of nominalising it and then negating the nominalisation人と比べなく、過去の自分と比べる。
I have learned in school that じゃ　ありましん　is the "non-past negative" conjugation of です.Example:私は日本人じゃありません。"I am not Japanese."I have noticed that じゃ　ありません contains the pronunciation of the negative form of あります.From a strictly grammatical point of view, does じゃ　ありません say that something doesn't exist If so, what is the grammatical purpose of attaching じゃ to the proceeding word
My understanding is that 思われる, in addition to being the passive form of 思う, can also be used in the sense of "to spontaneously think; to appear". 北米では通常スカートは女性がはくものと思われている。  In North America a skirt is thought of as something a woman wears.In which sense is 思われる being used here Both seem reasonable:Spontaneous: In North America, people spontaneously think a skirt is something a woman wears.Passive: A skirt is thought of by North Americans as something a woman wears.I lean more towards the first one, since a passive sentence would normally mark the agent with に i.e. スカートは北米人には女性がはくものと思われている。
I tried to say "I'm not a high school student". But I read you can use じゃない to 'deny' something. In this case which one should I use ではありません or じゃない 私{わたし}はこうこうの学生{がくせい}ではありません。or  私{わたし}はこうこうの学生{がくせい}じゃないです。
The kanji version 付き合う contains only elementary characters with their usual readings. Is there a reason why it's still usually written in kana Is there a difference in nuance when written in kanjiEDIT As to why I think that it's typically written in kana, I just observed the following:My textbook (イラストでわかる日本語表現) writes it in kana.My dictionary (ウィズダム英和・和英辞典) writes it in kana in all example sentences.ことえり (Apple's OS X input method) suggests to use kana when I write it.Of course that's not necessarily representative of contemporary use by native speakers, but it appears that there are some writers who strongly prefer kana.
Am I correct assuming that both おお and おう are homophones in Japanese - both being pronounced as long o I suspect I am, since that's what I'm indirectly reading in various tutorials. If so, are there any (non necessarily exhaustive) rules to guess the correct spelling of the words with long o I speak several languages where there are no strict  spelling rules, but still there are some hints that help guess the right spelling most of the time. Is there such a rule for  おお vs おう in Japanese
I thought this had been asked before (possibly by me), but I couldn't find it.  I'm wondering why for certain verbs/words, instead of just a 自他 pair, there is a triplet (or possibly more) where two of the verbs are one type (自 or 他) and the third is the other type.  Some examples:他　→　縮【ちぢ】める　：　自　→　縮【ちぢ】まる　：　縮【ちぢ】む　→　both    see @snailboat comment below - dictionary confirms.  Exs.    自　→　寿命が縮む　：　他　→　「ちぢめるの文語形」in dictionary def.他　→　繋【つな】ぐ　・　繋【つな】げる　：　自　→　繋【つな】がる他　→　緩【ゆる】める　：　自　→　緩【ゆる】まる　：　緩【ゆる】む　→　both (same as above)他　→　滅【ほろ】ぶ　・　滅【ほろ】びる　：　自　→　滅【ほろ】ぼす他　→　含【ふく】む　・　含【ふく】める　：　自　→　含【ふく】まるWhat's the deal with these triplets  Why are there two accepted verbs of one form for the same meaning  Are they somehow different  Is one of the two a classic/obsolete form like I talked about here  Does one of the two somehow rise to dominance over the other  I admit that I encounter 繋【つな】ぐ a lot less than 繋【つな】げる, but 縮【ちぢ】む seems just as frequent as 縮【ちぢ】まる to me.Any other examples would be great to list too.
I know that most of "why" questions don't make much sense as far as linguistics are concerned but I'll ask anyway.I know that  き means a tree. いろ means color. It doesn't take a genius to guess that きいろ (lit. tree color) should mean green. But it means yellow. Is there any reason for this
I want to say "I saw 10 episodes", but I can't find the appropriate counter.I may use "つ" counter (十エピソードを見ました), but it's not very classy.
The following paragraph is from page 20 of 涼宮ハルヒの憂鬱:　ところで今教室に涼宮ハルヒはいない。いたらこんな話も出来ないだろうが、たとえいたとしてもまったく気にしないような気もする。その涼宮ハルヒだが、四時間目が終わるとすぐ教室を出て行って五時間目が始まる直前にならないと戻ってこないのが常だ。弁当を持ってきた様子はないから食堂を利用しているんだろう。しかし昼飯に一時間もかけないだろうし、そういや授業の合間の休み時間にも必ずと言っていいほど教室にはいない奴で、いったいどこをうろついているんだか。 My question is about the end of the last sentence, which I've put in bold.  It ends with だか, but as I understand it, the sentence-final particle か is ungrammatical after だ in standard Japanese.  Therefore, I was thinking that one of two possibilities must be true:It is grammatical, but only in non-standard Japanese;It's grammatical because it's not a sentence-final use of か; it's a different use of か.For example, I know that だか appears in 何だか, and that's not ungrammatical because it's not a sentence-final use of か.  So, I thought perhaps the same thing might apply here.But in order for it to be a non-sentence-final use of か, the sentence would have to continue, and so, I would have to conclude that the rest of the sentence here is omitted.  That's exactly what @Matt talks about in this comment:There are utterances like どうだか ("I wonder!" -- expressing doubt) but I suppose they are better viewed as fragments of an implied larger whole (e.g. どうだか知らないけど) where か is functioning slightly differently.Is that how I should interpret this sentence, as well  I'm not sure what would follow, exactly, but perhaps I could use something like the ending Matt suggests:いったいどこをうろついているんだか知らない。Am I interpreting the sentence correctly
Are there any words or phrases in Japanese more specific than イングリッシュ, but still used in normal Japanese conversation, to describe native speakers of Japanese either mis-typing or mis-pronouncing an "R" for "L" or vice versa when they are typing or speaking EnglishA term that covers all consonant-related issues is fine.
Is there any difference between お腹を空かす and お腹を空かせる I get they both mean to become hungry (literally empty the stomach). 空かせる is the potential form of 空かす, but that doesn't make sense here. Dictionaries don't seem to indicate any difference.お腹を空かせたその男は、食物をむさぼり食った。  The hungry man devoured the food.  彼は１日中何も食べてなく、お腹を空かしていた。  He hadn't eaten all day and was hungry.
I've read that 日本人の知らない日本語 translates to: "Japanese (language) that Japanese (people) don't know". But I don't understand how or what the の does in that sentence. If I'm not mistaken 知らない日本語 could mean "Japanese language that (x) don't know" or "even unknown Japanese". But I don't get how the 日本人の fits into the translation.
Is it okay to use に to mark the caller when using 電話がかかる i.e. A received a call from B would beAはBに電話がかかった。Google seems to indicate that から is a much more popular choice than に. I find it a bit strange, since I thought (whenever both に and から are viable options) に was preferred for agents and から for sources, and receiving a phone call seems more like the former case.
I'm confused about how と is used in this sentence (乗るとすぐメールを・・・）... What purpose does it serve電車の中では携帯で話すことはできませんが、みんな電車に乗るとすぐメールを熱心に打っているのにびっくりしました。Thank you!
I found the following in a book I'm reading:As far as I'm aware, 窘める is read たしなめる and means "to scold, rebuke, admonish". 宥める, on the other hand, is read なだめる and means "to soothe, placate". Are there any situations in which 窘める could be read なだめる Or would this have to be some sort of publishing error (possibly caused by how similar 宥める and 窘める look)
What's the female equivalent for the informal ぼく I've heard that females will tend to use わたし, but then it's said to be formal. Doesn't there exist a female informal "I"
*disclaimer:*I'am still learning hiragana, so forgive me for any wrong spellingI've learnt that normally only males use ぼく (boku). What about ぼくたち (bokutachi) Should it normally be reserved for male-only groups or can it be used by a male to refer to a mixed-gender group of "we" Can a female use it to refer to a mixed-gender group
Now, we have lots of resources for learning  Japanese - tons of textbooks, dictionaries, audio and video recordings, educational software etc.But in the past - How did Europeans first approach Japanese language (They didn't have any of these resources..) How did they start learning it for the first time
First, I'd like to mention that I've seen this question, which is related but doesn't quite seem to be a duplicate.I've covered some Hiragana lessons and it seems there is no L in Japanese. The Japanese R seems to be a bit closer to L than the English R, but still, the Japanese accent stereotype doesn't seem to be far fetched. For example, the nice lady in this tutorial(at the very beginning) says:Konnichiwa, let's start(u) tuday's reson.But on the other hand, when she speaks about numbers(0:38), she pronounces the number 6 with a clear L sound: /lok(u)/, although the romaji spelling seems to be roku From the linked question I understood that the difference between L and R sounds in Japanese is not clearcut. My question is: what exactly does "not clearcut" mean Does it mean that certain words are pronounced with r (such as suru) and others with l (such as roku) Or is it a dialect thing Or is it personal preference, i.e. some people from the same region will say /rok(u)/ while others will say /lok(u)/I actually  have a similar question about /dz/ and /j/ sounds (in particular, I can't understand how is 10 supposed to be pronounced). If the answer is similar, please mention that, otherwise I'll ask a separate question.
In this answer, nkjt gives the following example of なんか insertion:　　　　待ってないんだから　→　待ってなんかないんだからOn the left-hand side, it appears that 〜ていない is contracted to 〜てない.  This is very common, of course, but as I understand it, contractions of いる to る only happen after 〜て, as in the following examples:　　　　持っている　　→　持ってる　　　　持っていない　→　持ってない　　　　持っています　→　持ってますIn the example with なんか inserted, it seems that いない is contracted to ない, even though it follows something other than 〜て! Is this possibleIf it is, I'm forced to wonder about the いません version, as well:　　　　持っていない　　→　持ってなんかない　　　　持っていません　→　持ってなんかませんIf they are acceptable, how do you explain it  Is my "only after 〜て" rule incorrect
A Dictionary of Basic Japanese Grammar (ADoBJG) lists more than one を particle.  In particular:On page 347, it lists o1, a particle which marks a direct object.On page 349, it lists o2, a particle which indicates a space in / on / across / through / along which s.o. or s.t. moves.The second particle, which I'll call directional を, appears to be used quite differently from the direct object を.  According to ADoBJG, the directional を is used only with verbs of motion, which I think are generally intransitive.  For example, directional を appears in the phrase 空を飛ぶ, combining the intransitive verb of motion 飛ぶ with an を-marked noun.Since it's listed as a separate particle in ADoBJG, and since it behaves so differently, and since it appears in different contexts from the other を, I've always thought of directional を as a separate particle which happens to be written and pronounced the same way.  However, in 国語辞典s such as 大辞林 and 大辞泉, both usages are listed under the same entry.  So I'm wondering how independent the two really are.It seems to me that, because directional を appears with intransitive verbs, and because direct object を appears with transitive verbs, the two occupy separate syntactic slots.  That makes me wonder if it's possible to take a construction such as 空を飛ぶ, which uses the directional を, and turn it into a transitive construction which also takes the direct object を, such as ◯◯を空を飛ばす.My thought is this: if they don't really occupy different slots, then this is ungrammatical because of the double-o constraint, which says that a single verb phrase may have no more than one を-marked noun phrase.  But if they do occupy different slots, and they're really different particles, then you should be able to create a single verb phrase containing both.I'm not sure my ◯◯を空を飛ばす example is very good.  (It's supposed to mean "send ◯◯ flying through the air".)  But if it's possible to create a grammatical example combining both directional を and direct object を, I would like to know, regardless of whether my particular example is very good.Is it possible to create such a construction
During the past month I've been addicted to Japanese. I've listened to about 10 online tutorial video courses and read about as much printed lessons. I am determined to learn Japanese, but I am really a newbie so my question may be very basic, but please bear with me.If I understand correctly, both -ga and -o particles designate a direct object.For example, I've heard:Watashi wa ongaku-ga suki desu. = I like musicWatashi wa ongaku-o kiku (or kikimasu, I'm not sure) = I am listening to musicSo why is it ga in one case and o in the other Is it specific to the verb or the object or whatP.S. I don't know hiragana yet, so I'd appreciate if you could keep your examples, if any, in romaji.
I was at a Japanese class and saw what I thought was a mistake, or at best shorthand for the character [傘]{かさ} -&gt; 仐 I thought the four ([人]{ひと}) had been forgotten but my Japanese teacher told me this was regular Japanese like how other archaic characters get simplified (國 -&gt; [国]{こく}, see Wiki page here). I am not convinced so if anyone could share more solid evidence on the validity of the character or your own opinions
For example, the following 3:  女っぽい (おんなっぽい)女らしい (おんならしい)女みたい (おんなみたい)In what situations would you use っぽい over らしい？ Does っぽい have negative connotations Are 女らしい and 女みたい interchangeable as in 彼女は本当に女らしい／彼女は本当に女みたいI would love if someone could contrast these 3 terms.
I've often seen 'read the air' (literal translation) or 'read between the lines' but is there a better rendition of this concept in English Or does it just not exist
I have started to read a novel for practice. I came across these sentences. I can't make sense of the part 通って中に.少年はあそこ一夜過ごすことに決めた。彼は羊の群れが、壊れかけた門を通って中に、入るのを見届けてから、夜中に羊が迷い出さないように、何本かの棒を門にわたした。I cannot find an explanation for the use of the combination of the verb in te-form and chuu ni. Figuring out this part would help me a lot to put together what the sentence says.
I've been teaching ESL for over 30 years, but for the last three I've had almost exclusively Japanese students (I teach mostly 1-on-1 classes over Skype, to students from High School to Business Executives.) I'm also a professional linguist and somewhat of a hyperglot, but very much still a dilettante when it comes to Japanese. My question is this:Is there any way using kana to represent the unpalatalized /s/ before /i/ or /ɪ/ When Japanese students read /si/, most of them invariably pronounce /ʃi/ because... well, you know why. I have many workarounds and ways of demonstrating the difference, but I thought it might be a truckload easier if there were a way of demonstrating this unequivocally so that when they saw it, the light would go on immediately.事前にありがとうございます!
What's a nice way to express any of the following - "Let's keep our fingers crossed""I'll keep my fingers crossed!"(We / I) (are / am) keeping (our / my ) fingers crossed"
Consider the following sentence (emphasis mine):ひょっとしたら僕が​圧力の一つや二つをかけられて​いることも知っているのかもしれない。The bolded part is kind of confusing me. I get that 圧力をかけられる means "to be pressured" or "to have pressure applied [to one]", but I don't understand how you can have 一つや二つの圧力, since 圧力 seems like an uncountable noun. Is this just an unusal way of saying 僕が一度や二度圧力をかけられた ("[someone] pressured me once or twice")
人間に[上下]{じょうげ}はない。  People are equal.Why the use of に after 人間 Are we treating 人間 as a "location" where 上下 is absent
この仕事はあと一部を残すだけだ。  Only one part of the job remains.Does one think of あと (remainder) as a noun (and object of 残す) and 一部 as a counter/adverb, or is あと the adverb and 一部 the noun here
Are the names of new political parties, especially in English-speaking countries, typically translated, or transliteratedI looked at the Japanese language Wikipedia template for Australian political parties, and saw that Family First seemed to be translated (家族優先党), while the Australian Sex Party and One Nation seemed to be transliterated (オーストラリアセックス党 and ワン・ネイション) apart from the "党".Background: Australia's Liberal Democratic Party looks like it might win a seat, and I'm curious whether it'd be called "自由民主党", as is claimed by the Japanese edition of Wikipedia here.
I've seen all three used in somewhat similar situations.What are the differences between them, and in which cases should i use one over another
Here is a piece of text from 「ノルウェイの森」by Haruki Murakami:この寮の唯一の問題点はその根本的なうさん臭さにあった。寮はあるきわめて右翼的な人物を中心とする正体不明の財団法人によって運営されており、その運営方針は――もちろん僕の目から見ればということだが――かなり奇妙に歪んだものだった。How are these things before もちろん and かなり called and what function they serveIs it a mark equal to 、 or something informal like ~~~ and expressing a short speech pause in a middle of the sentence In any case, what is its name
勉強しなさいよ！ i know what this means.. but what is the origin of しなさい Does it come from  する　(to do verb) Is it short form of something or what
Or is it just a neutral term for tidal waves(I'm considering naming a JavaScript library tsunami.js – would it be offensive)
I apologize if this is a basic question, but it's something I've never been entirely clear on. When using the verb 言う (to say), I can never figure out whether to use the particle -と or the particle  -を for the thing being said. I know that -と　is used for quotations, but what about when the thing being said is not a direct quotation For example, is it acceptable to say:彼女は何と言いましたか。  What did she sayor先生が宿題の締切りと言いましたか。  Did the teacher say what the deadline on the homework isIn these two situations, I'm not sure whether to use を or と. Can anyone tell me what the difference between is
その帽子に赤いマフラーが似合いそうだ。  A red muffler seems to go well with that hat.Is there a difference in nuance between the above sentence and the following oneその帽子には赤いマフラーが似合いそうだ。I get that it's emphasised that the hat is the topic in the second sentence, but really it's hard to think about the first sentence as not necessarily being about the hat.
Closed. This question is off-topic. It is not currently accepting answers.                                            Want to improve this question Update the question so it's on-topic for Japanese Language Stack Exchange.                Closed 7 years ago.                        Improve this question                    "Premature optimization is the root of all evil"I would like to translate this quote into Japanese for a personal project. For further understanding of the meaning, Donald Knuth wrote this phrase in 1974, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_optimization, context:We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evilGoogle translate gave me 時期尚早な最適化は諸悪の根源である but I'm not confident on it's correctness, and it seems a bit long
I am aware of the generic　English translation:　In this case, "device" or "to devise" in English, but this does not really help me out.　In what context would you use this word 例文　would really be appreciated. Thank you!
Could somebody tell me the meaning/use of both もs in bold in the following sentence It is the background explanation for the essay titled 「さよなら、ゴジラ先生」 in the magazine, 中上級のにほんご.Also, I am not sure about the use of こんな in the second sentence; again what is it referring to I think it means "this kind of doctor" but what kind Should I be able to infer the adjective, or is this an invitation to read on and find out 日本の大きな病院は、診察してもらうにも時間がかかります。そして、なんだか怖い感じ。でも、こんな先生もいるのですね。今月は、大病院の診察室を舞台にしたエッセーです。The answer must surely relate to context but I should appreciate an explanation from someone who understands.
I'm looking at JLPT4/5 grammar list and see such grammar point. But I can't find any information about it (truthfully I don't know how to).Though I found some examples:1 shuukan ni ikkai - once a week1 nen ni 3 kai - 3 times a yearCan someone explain this or point me to where I can get that information Thanks.
I noticed that both 死ぬ and the 音読み of 死 share a し sound. Is this a huge coincidence between Japanese and Chinese, or is there some sort of relation I guess the former, because I don't know any function ぬ may have after a borrowed noun, but I don't know much about etymology.
Jisho says 渡る is an intransitive verb, and ALC says it is sometimes 自動 and sometimes 他動.In either case, the particle を can be used. What's going on here
こんにちは、皆さん。ちょっと質問があります。今日、この歌を聞きました。最初の歌詞はこれです：アイデンティティがない　生まれない　ららららでも意味が分かりません。英訳するができない。「(If you) have no identity, (you) haven't been born」と思いますが、確かめたいです。日本語で説明していい。手伝てくれてありがとう！
Quoting from page 292 of A Dictionary of Basic Japanese Grammar (DBJG), entry for に, note 2:"Any transitive verb used in the V-てあげる or V-てくれる construction can take に, if the verb does not take a human direct object.""...ほめる, which takes a human object, cannot take に..."The (only) example they give for the second quote is先生は私(を / *に)ほめてくださいました。  My teacher praised me.My issue is that since the indirect object (the one receiving the favour) and direct object (the one praised) are the same (私), one would normally leave out the indirect object anyway. i.e. you wouldn't say☓先生は私に私をほめてくださいました。But DBJG seem to be saying that a transitive verb in てあげる form with a human direct object cannot take an indirect object under any circumstances.So let's construct a sentence where the indirect object and direct object are two different people (me and Tanaka respectively). Is the following sentence allowed先生は私に田中を叱ってくださいました。  The teacher scolded Tanaka (for my sake).
I'm learning Japanese and I just finished learning Hiragana and Katakana and now I'm moving to Kanji. In my studies I found that 午前8時 means 8 a.m Ok, that's cool but I would like to know how to pronunciate it.Should I just combine the sounds I mean 午 is ご, 前 is まえ and 時とき so 午前8時 would be ごまえ8ときThank you very much!
In English, we have constructions like "Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York" (MLK's I Have A Dream speech) and "Let there be light" (Genesis 1:3, KJV and other versions). Is there an idiomatic Japanese equivalent of this construction I can imagine circumlocuting around it with something like ニューヨークの偉大なる山から自由が響くようにあろう, but I'm not sure if that's idiomatic (or even correct) Japanese. The Japanese Living Bible seems to translate "Let there be light" as 「光よ、輝け」, but that seems to me to mean "Shine, light", which is not really the same thing.
I was looking at the heisei wiki page and I wondered how you would refer to future dates in the japanese calendarFor example would 'The 2020 olympics' be '[平成]{へいせい}３２[年]{ねん}のオリンピック' Is there some standardIf this was on a web page and an era change occurred would you need to update it
I've been searching up words like '～の近く' (near), '～の裏側' (behind), '～より先' (further away). Basically words related to the position of an object or thing. The term I've been using is 前置詞 in Japanese, but I'm not sure this is right.The thing is, even though I search up '前置詞', I'm always given a list of websites of foreign language prepositions translated to Japanese.  So my question is, are grammar-related terms such as 前置詞, 動詞, 名詞, something that was created because of the influx of foreign languages study in Japan or did these terms already exist natively in the Japanese language
First off I know zero Japanese, so sorry if this is a stupid question.  I seem to remember hearing a while back that all Japanese words, when transliterated to the Latin alphabet, will end in a vowel.  From the few Japanese words/names I've seen this seems possible.  Is there any truth to this  If true, does anyone know why that is
A sentence from JapanesePod 101:北米とヨーロッパでは通常スカートは女性がはくものと思われているが、世界的には多くの男性がスカートをはく。In North America and Europe a skirt is thought of as something a woman wears, but in many countries men wear skirts.I don't see why it's 世界的には rather than 世界的では, especially when では is used in the first clause. で seems to fit both clauses (location of action).
近所のバーは友達とお酒を飲むのにちょうどいい場所だ。The neighbourhood bar is a great place to have a drink with friends.Does one think of the dependent clause 友達とお酒を飲むのに as modifying the い-adjective ちょうどいい (which then modifies 場所), or does it modify the main clause ちょうどいい場所だ  I'm aware that nouns can be modified by putting a clause in front (e.g. ぼくが食べたりんご), but to my knowledge this doesn't apply to い-adjectives. Perhaps I'm overthinking this.
Another sentence from Kanji in Context.初めて[山奥]{やまおく}から町に出てきた村の人たちは見るものすべてに[驚]{おどろ}いた。In this instance, does 山奥から町に出てきた mean "left the mountains and came to the city" (町) Also, I would normally interpret 出てくる as "leave and come back", but maybe from the viewpoint of someone in the city it makes sense.
I've come across two similar examples of a usage of の I am not familiar with. 彼は運のいい男だ意志の強い人だI kinda understand how it is supposed to work but feel like I could parse it better if I were to hear how they are supposed to be broken up mentally.Like this （運のいい）男 OR like this 運の(いい男)In other words... I want to know if it is saying that he is a man of good fortune or saying that is is a man good of fortune.ALSO:How often does this come up Is it any different in meaning to 運がいい男だ Is it more polite or something

背負う is pronounced せおう, but many dictionaries also list a second pronunciation as しょう.I've never heard it pronounced as しょう in practice.  In what situations does it have this pronunciation   Is that only an archaic pronunciation, or is it still in use  Is it a regional/dialectical thing  Is one free to pronounce it with either way, unrestrictedせおう (or おう, rather) conjugates as a 五段.  Does しょう also conjugate as a 五段ます形　→　しょいますない形　→　しょわない～て･た形　→　しょって・た命令形　→　しょえ仮定形　→　しょえば可能形　→　しょえる意志形　→　しょおう
I can remember hearing this combination of sounds several times, and the way it's used makes me think that it's a part of a common phase or saying.  Particularly I can point to two cases where it was used in Ergo Proxy episode 1.  In one case, it had the following usage, with the meaning that two events that were just mentioned are probably connected.てんとてん　は　せい　に　なるI'm not writing that with any kanji because this was just heard, and I can't claim to know any of the meanings with total confidence.I know there was another place てんとてん was used, and I think it was within a repeated phrase.  It went something like this:てんとてん　を　結ぶ ...I'm trying to locate where this was said.  The next word might have been そうな and then something else, but I'm less sure about that part.It's not in the Jim Breen dictionary, nor is any other similar pronunciation I can think of.  I also don't see very much particularly on Google.  Still, I'm sure about this usage and I hope that a native speaker will see these sentences and know right away what it's saying.
This may be my Chinese getting in the way of my Japanese again, but doesn't 体育 and スポーツ both mean "sport"What are the differences between them, and when is one used over the other
I would like to ask for help with translating the following sentence:今日は、「練習していないことは嘘をつかない」という悲しいセリフを実感しました。練習も嘘をつかないんだけど、その逆も然り。I understand parts of it for example練習していないことは嘘をつかない悲しいセリフ実感するBut my problem is putting them together in translation of the sentence above. Also, I found out that 実感する　means "have a feeling", "my actual feeling" is or "to realize", but I can't make it out which one is the right one here.So basically, I have problem with the use of the verb 実感する, furthermore with the translation of the whole sentence.
I've heard that Japanese is spoken by some Taiwanese people who were old enough to have lived during Japanese rule, along with some people who've learnt it for other reasons. For younger people, I've been told Mandarin or English would be the best means of communication, but I have a tendency to socialize a lot with retirees.How similar is the Japanese spoken in Taiwan by native speakers to the Japanese used in Japan Did the two diverge after 1945 Are words that entered Japanese after 1945 also used in the Japanese spoken in Taiwan
I've come across these words which can all mean "finally". What I'd like to know is how they differ in usage [nuance and formality]. Below are their respective entries in the 研究社 新和英大辞典 第5版.いよいよ1 〔ますます〕 still [even, ever] more; more and more; all the more; more than ever; increasingly; steadily.2 〔ついに･とうとう〕 at (long) last; finally.3 〔さしせまった状態〕    やっと1 〔ようやく〕 at (long) last; at length; ultimately; finally; 〔苦難の末に〕 with difficulty; with [after] much [painstaking] effort.2 〔かろうじて〕 barely; narrowly; by the skin of one's teeth; 〔ぎりぎりで〕 just; only; 〔ひどい苦難の末にようやく〕 with [after] much [painstaking] effort; with difficulty; laboriously.ようやく〔次第に〕 gradually; little by little; by ┌degrees [inches]; 〔ついに〕 at (long) last; finally; at length; 〔かろうじて〕 barely; hardly; narrowly; 〔骨折って〕 with (much) difficulty; with a great deal of trouble; 〔わずかに〕 (only) just. [=やっと]  ついに〔肯定文で〕 at (long) last; at length; finally; in the end; in the long run; in time; ultimately; 〔否定文で〕 after all. [=とうとう1]  とうとうat last; at length; finally; in the end; ultimately; 〔結局…しない〕 after all.As I understand it,  いよいよ and やっと carries some anticipation, ようやく implies difficulty, effort involved and it's more formal, ついに has some negative connotation and とうとう is mostly neutral. However, I'm not quite sure.Thank you in advance for your insights.
ゟ is a digraph that is read より. Where does it originate from Is it a ligature, like &amp; &lt;- et, or German ß &lt;- ſs -&gt; ss (Wikipedia claims this, citing no source.) Also, if it is a ligature, what did the ligation process look like (e.g. what are the intermediate forms between より and ゟ)Alternatively, could it be a derivative of 与 or another kanji (Another non-authoritative source which I have now lost track of claims this.)
下種／下衆／下司 are all pronounced "gesu." According to various dictionaries "gesu" can be used to describe a sleazebag, a humble person, or a petty official. How can one differentiate between which to use How are they supposed to be used
A Japanese friend of mine explained to me that many people often incorrectly use the honorific お in the example sentence. The correct sentence is without the お.I have two questions regarding this point, has anyone seen, or heard this mistake Secondly, can anyone explain the rule that is governing this particular part of language and why the お is incorrect in this case.
歩いて二十分ほどのところにある川原です。It's a riverbank about twenty minutes away by foot.I have a couple of questions with the usage of 歩いて here:The usage of the te-form without an auxiliary verb (e.g. 歩いていく) or another verb eventually finishing the clause feels strange. Is there another verb implied but omitted, i.e.「歩いて二十分ほどかかるところにある川原です。」It also seems strange for the te-form to be something like a conditional form here (if we walk it's twenty minutes). Would 「歩けば二十分ほどのところにある川原です。」 also work
I understand the concept of でしょう. All my books say that it is like saying "probably". I have also been told that it is more accurately a means of adding doubt to a statement to seem less assuming and confrontational...If this is the case however, why would a statement like "うそでしょ!" be possible It sounds as strange to me as emphatically yelling "PROBABLY!" as an answerI need more details. For example, it stems from であろう/でありましょう doesn't it If you interpreted that literally would it give any clues to how to understand the phrase in the same way Japanese understand itFurthermore, how is it different to 多分 or かもしれませんPlease provide your insight!
I've been reading some old text recently and I find that everybody seems to use plain forms even in polite contexts (like proclamations from the Emperor). When did the modern ます and です come from I hear です is a new word coming from the Meiji era standardizations as a compromise between だ, であります, and でございます, but I'm not sure whether that is reliable. When did ます appearAlso, I hear all 敬語 ultimately came from 関西弁. Does ます come there too The 丁寧語 in the Kansai region seems to use 連用形 + まんねん though.
全然 means "completely" in Chinese, and also in Classical Chinese. Why does 全然 only go with negative conjugations in Japanese My teacher also says that you cannot say とても with negative things in Japanese either.Why is this so I suppose when the Japanese originally borrowed 全然 it would be used with both positive and negative things.Aside: does the current usage of とても and 全然 reflect Japanese evolving a negative concord system, which otherwise doesn't exist I presume in normal Japanese a double negative resolves to a positive
I cannot understand what is 自分でも無様なくらいに means in the following sentence. I'd translate it like - "I felt so akward, that my voice trembled"自分でも無様なくらいに声が震えていたThank you very much for help!

I came across the anime/manga title 「進撃の巨人」 and I am a bit confused about the usage of the の particle there.I know that の has several uses, but I'm not sure which one applies in this case. I looked at the possible ways の can be used with a noun and tried figuring out which one might apply:It seems like it would indicate possession, but that would make it"giants of charge", which sounds weird to me (as opposed to "chargeof the giants", 巨人の進撃, which is what I would have expected).I know の can also be used for nominalization, but 進撃 is already anoun, so that doesn't seem likely to me. This isn't really asubordinate clause either.Wikipedia also lists another function of の, with the followingexample:車のトヨタ - Toyota the car [company]This one doesn't seem to apply in this case either, I think.None of these possible meanings of の make sense to me in this case. Can you help me understand how/why の is used in this title
My Japanese friend asked me whether I believe in an afterlife.I wanted to say, "I don't believe, but also I don't not believe." My point is that while I do not believe, I like to keep an open mind.I intentionally use the double negative, because the meaning is different from simply collapsing the double negative into a positive: "I don't believe, but also I believe," which makes no sense.The best I could come up with in my clunky Japanese is "信じていないけど信じたい" but that doesn't really say what I want either.Is there a better way to get my point across Does Japanese make possible these kinds of tortuous constructs
I wanted to express the idea "performing to one's full abilities at work", and the obvious thing to write was 仕事に[能力]{のうりょく}を[生]{い}かす. Indirect object before direct object. But a look on google indicates 能力を仕事に生かす is a much more popular word ordering. Is there any reason for thisAlso, is 仕事で能力を生かす admissible (Treating work as a location now).
あなたにいつもおせわになってますからね.What does the above sentence meanI'm confused about the おせわになってます part.
ある is listed in dictionaries as having ラ行五段活用, which would suggest a negative form of あらない. However, that form does not exist. Why not
何事も最初は難しく、やがてやさしくなる。  All things are difficult before they are easy.I've never seen an い-adjective used in this way (難しく). Would using 難しくて (which is what I would have used) change the meaning of the sentence

The song eX Dream by Myuji (which appears in an anime OP) contains the sentence:[夢]{ゆめ}は夢でしかないThe general point of the sentence is fairly clear, meaning "a dream is just a dream".  But what is the best way to think of the でしかない constructionAt first I saw it as 夢は夢で, as in, "a dream is a dream and...", but now I'm wondering how correct this is or if it's correct at all.Is it better to look at it as a separation of the parts of である  Does this happen in many other cases, where you use a qualified で followed by ある
I've seen these words used in the following sentences:以後: それ以後彼女に会っていません以降: それ以降彼は辛い一生を送ったJudging from these examples alone, I guess they have some kind of overlap.When is it appropriate to use one over the other
Title basically says most of it. To add more context to that 「YOUは何しに日本へ？」 is a name of a japanese TV show, found it on YouTube. They meet random foreigners at the airport and ask them this question.I can make an intelligent guess that this is contacted form of 「何するのに」, but I have doubts, since why would they ask a question with slangy words to people who can hardly speak the language On the other hand the use of 「YOUは」 might indicate that this whole phrase can be slangy from the start.Many thanks.
I find the difference between 「広める (他動詞) 広げる (他動詞)」 and between 「広まる (自動詞) 広がる (自動詞)」 to be complicated.Can someone explain

I've been in Japan for the summer and noticed that the announcement for the closing doors (in the Kansai area, at least) on trains is always 扉が閉まります. However, the equivalent announcement on buses appears to be a toss-up between 扉が閉まります and ドアが閉まります.Is there an accepted distinction between 扉 and ドア jisho.org gives ドア as a Western-style door and 扉 as a (generic) door. Are there any other distinguishing nuances
Another sentence from Kanji in Context:自分は偉いと思って人を見下しているとそのうち逆に他の人から見下されるようになる。Those who think highly of themselves and look down on others will eventually themselves be looked down upon (by others).I've been puzzling over the choice to put は (instead of が) after 自分. It's the only は in the sentence and presumably marks the topic. Actually I find the topic itself unclear, if this was meant as a warning the topic could well be the listener, or this could just be a general observation of people.What bothers me most is the usage of は in a subordinate clause (of 思う) and nowhere else. Is this a sort of shorthand for not stating the topic explicitly i.e. could this be reworded as 人は自分が偉いと思って etc
吉田秀雄{よしだひでお} created the 鬼十則{おにじっそく} while working for 電通:仕事は自ら創るべきで、与えられるべきでない。 仕事とは、先手々と働き掛けていくことで、受け身でやるものではない。大きな仕事と取り組め、小さな仕事はおのれを小さくする。 難しい仕事を狙え、そしてこれを成し遂げるところに進歩がある。取り組んだら放すな、殺されても放すな、目的完遂までは……。周囲を引きずり回せ、引きずるのと引きずられるのとでは、永い間に天地のひらきができる。計画を持て、長期の計画を持っていれば、忍耐と工夫と、そして正しい努力と希望が生まれる。自信を持て、自信がないから君の仕事には、迫力も粘りも、そして厚みすらない。頭は常に全回転、八方に気を配って、一分の隙もあってはならぬ、サービスとはそのようなものだ。摩擦を怖れるな、摩擦は進歩の母、積極の肥料だ、でないと君は卑屈未練になる。The phrase 鬼十則{おにじっそく} seems to be uniquely related to the Dentsu guidelines. 十則 alone is used quite frequently on the other hand. When looking for what the 鬼 meant (why he selected the name) I came across this:まさに「鬼」の十則だが、本質を突いていてわかりやすい。Perhaps this is less a usage question than a cultural one, but I am a bit confused as to what the implication of the 鬼 is in 鬼十則{おにじっそく}.
The word 蹄 (ひづめ) means hoof in Japanese.  Since the meaning is similar to つめ (claw), and since it's spelled specifically with づ, it seems like this word is made up of two parts:ひ　＋　つめI can't figure out what the ひ part might mean, though.  It would make sense if it meant a large four-legged animal, or if it meant horse or something else along those lines.  But I can't find any information about it in dictionaries or by searching on Google.  (Has the origin of ひ in this word been lost)I also looked through lists of kanji by on and kun readings looking for reasonable candidates for ひ, but I wasn't able to find anything that seemed appropriate. Is it possible it comes from a shortening of 扁爪 (ひらづめ)？
I need help understanding some Japanese sentences. All the sentences are connected except the last one.今も手紙はたまに書きますよ。  mailよりも気持ちが伝わるんです。I know that the first sentence means "people also write letters nowadays".But it's the second sentence that confuses me. 伝わる means "to travel" but I guess in this context it means "conveyed/spread".So does it mean "Feelings can also be conveyed by mail".手書きのほうが温かいというか。Why is 温かい used here I thought it meant warm. As in warm water or warm food etc...Does it mean "Handwritten letters are warm" (as in warm heart)andあなたの仕事が終わってからでも大丈夫ですよ。I don't get this one at all. Also, what does でも do in the sentence
In English, we have prefixes, like "pre-"; suffixes, like "-ize"; and arguably, expletives that function as infixes (one classic example is "abso-fucking-lutely"). In Japanese, we also have prefixes, like 超～, 大～; and suffixes, like ～っぽい, ～化{か}. Does Japanese have any infixes, though I'm interested both in any modern, productive infixes that may exist that I'm not aware of, as well as any historically-productive infixes that are now fossilized.
Two ways of expressing 'only' in Japanese are だけ + positive verb and しか + negative verb. For example, the following sentences both translate to something like 'I drank only tea'.お茶だけ飲んだ (1)お茶しか飲まなかった (2)I recently heard a native speaker use だけしか + negative verb, and Google brings up plenty of hits for this construction. For example:お茶だけしか飲まなかった (3)Is there any difference in meaning between sentences (2) and (3) Does including 'だけ' just add emphasis
I apologize in advance for the possibly vulgar language, but I am asking purely from an academic perspective.My understanding is that both クソ and しまった translate roughly to the English "damn" when used as interjections. My question is, is there any particular difference in usage between the two From what I have observed, it seems that しまった is more likely to be used in reaction to circumstances that were under the control of the speaker. But I have heard enough exceptions that I have my doubts. Can anyone verify this And are there any other differences in usage
I'm studying nominalizers and don't understand when to use の/こと and when to use というの/ということ.For example, in the sentence:こんなによく[遅刻]{ちこく}をするというのは[問題]{もんだい}ですよ。Could I say:こんなによく[遅刻]{ちこく}をするのは[問題]{もんだい}ですよ。Is there any rule to choose の/こと or というの/ということThank you in advance!
What does the ぬ at the end of 立ち specify I can't find a verb that is just 立ちぬ, is this some kind of special form Can this be done with other verbs as well風立ちぬ, for reference, is Miyazaki's new film's name.
I'm a bit confused by the usage of さしあげる in this sentence from Kanji in Context:ただ今、来客中ですので、後ほどこちらからお電話さしあげます。We have a guest at the moment, so we'll call you later.To me, お電話いたします or even お電話いたしてさしあげます are more grammatical. Maybe it's really      お電話(を)さしあげます (I'll give you a call).
I never really thought about it before; but, I'm having a hard time explaining the difference concisely, and when to use which.What are the differences in nuances between あくまで and あくまでも  When is the use of あくまで preferable to あくまでも, and vice versa
Thank you for the so useful site you have. I'm studying by my self and I have found answer to a lot of questions I had. I'm using Nihongo somatome to try N3 and there is a sentence with の that I don't catch very well:私は少し苦みのあるコーヒーが好きです。In fact, is a sentence you have to sort properly, and my answer was:私は少し苦みあるコーヒーのが好きです。Why after の there is ある？I thought that always it would follow a particle...Thank you in advance!Sandra
I have a quote from this anime, FLCL:「とにかくさ、バット振んなきゃ話になんないよ」. In the official translation it's translated as "nothing can happen until you swing the bat". Now my japanese is pretty rusty, as I haven't used it in five years. I understand the meaning of the first part (とにかくさ、バット振んなきゃ) and that seems to match the translation correctly. But I don't understand how does 話になんない translate to "nothing can happen". Any explanation is welcome.

The above is a picture of a piece of cloth that is often worn on the head as part of a 死に装束. I have most commonly seen it referred to as a 天冠, but have also seen it referred to as a 髪隠し. Did the name 髪隠し originate as a pun on 神隠し (in the sense of "spiriting away"), which is a homophone Both terms have to do with death in a sense, and a 天冠 doesn't actually do that good a job of 隠すing the 髪 (so it doesn't seem like a particularly good choice of name), so I was curious.
どうして　わかりましたか。My teacher said this in a conversation and my brain translated it to "Why did you understand" (which didn't make much sense given the context!) but I think what she meant was "How did you notice".The context:Me: 先生{せんせい}は　犬{いぬ}が　好{す}きですね。Her: はい、好{す}きです。どうして　わかりましたか。Am I understanding this correctly If so, why did her question start with どうして instead of どう
I've been puzzling over this sentence from the (excellent) Kanji in Context.昔は、スポーツをして汗をかいた後でも水分をとってはいけないと言われていた。I get that it means "In the past, I was told not to drink water (even) after doing sports and sweating." Do we interpret the particle usage as 後で＋も (afterwards + even) or 後＋でも (after + even/although) The second one seems better, as the first one seems to imply I was told not to drink water under any circumstances.
I read that 要するに and つまり are not always interchangeable. Still, I don't really understand the difference between the two...
It might sound like a silly question, but I am just asking for interests sake... I already understand how to use them in which situation.If you were to say 田中さんは先生でいます, it would mean that Tanaka exists "by means of" a or the teacher(sensei), ie. "as a teacher." Thereby, it is 田中 doing the existing.So I wonder.. who or what is doing the ある'ing　in でありますIs it sort of like 感じがする, where it is not the person that is feeling something, but rather the feeling that is doing somethingIn other words and to rephrase my question, is it like as if Tanaka's reality exists in a way that he is a teacher(sensei)Is there some sort of historical story that gave way to the difference between いる and ある
Closed. This question is off-topic. It is not currently accepting answers.                                            Want to improve this question Update the question so it's on-topic for Japanese Language Stack Exchange.                Closed 4 years ago.                        Improve this question                    I wanted to know if there is any reference source or authoritative material about kanji pronunciations and when they were first imported into Japanese Any book or electronic source, English or Japanese.I would like something like this (data are wrong here, it's just a sample of what I need to see): 会カイ  -- imported into Japan during the Tang dynasty, 12th century, for the word 会議エ    -- imported during the Ming dynasty, 15th century, for the word 仏会
The way I visualize how the particle は works is that it opens a giant circle underneath the word it is attached to wherein you can discuss things related to it.Sort of like this: When I use ば I sort of visualize it in the same way... like I am attaching a giant circle to  a hypothetical situation as exemplified by the 仮定形{かていけい} form and then talking about possibilities within it.So I want to know... are they related in any way
For example in Genesis 1:元始{はじめ}に神{かみ}　天地{てんち}を創造{つくり}たまへりWhy are the kanji 元始 and 創造 given the interesting readings Moreover, they seem to be given the readings of the less specific words 始め and 作り. Why not do this:始めに神　天地を作りたまへりI understand the motivation of giving a technical kanji compound to denote a special concept, but usually when that happens an ad-hoc 和製漢語 or existing 音読み compound reading is given. So why not元始{げんし}に神　天地を 創造{そうぞう}したまへりIs this practice of using kanji compounds imported from China but instead giving the reading of the closest Japanese word more common in Classical Japanese
I sometimes wonder how feasible is it to completely avoid loanwords, i.e. 漢語 and 外来語, but still using Modern Japanese (i.e. not simply just using Old/Classical Japanese vocabulary). Is the 和語 inventory of Modern Japanese still intact enough to express arbitrary ideas, or at least enough to write article-length things I suppose some workarounds would be needed (say, 日本語 as ひのもとことば) but would it be technically possible, or has enough supplanting happened that some concepts are just impossible to express without loanwords
I found this sentence as an answer to the question: "What are some of the symbols of Japan's wealth"次期主力戦闘機を何機も買おうとしていることI'm not sure whether it means they're buying a lot of next-generation fighters, or none at all.I think it's a bunkei I have yet to learn, and I can't find it in the textbook.
My dictionary (EN → JP) suggests to translate "Three multiplied by four is twelve" as3 × 4 = 12without giving a hint as to how to read this in Japanese.How do you read simple arithmetic equations (involving only +, –, × and ÷) like the one above in Japanese
My kanji textbook contains this example text excerpt from a leaflet [1]:各種家具を破格値で！I would assume that it would be 「チ」 because 「ハカク」 is an Onyomi-Reading, but I believe I have heard 「はかくね」before. I could not find it in 大辞林, so could someone who knows better please enlighten meThank you.[1] 第６週２日目 in 佐々木仁子、松本典子：日本語総まとめ N2 漢字。株式会社アスク出版、東京都、2012.
I have some problems with understanding what is the difference between these two. According to 初級日本語, 間 refers to certain time frame whereas 間に refers to certain time frame within that time frame. Is it correct or am I missing something
At the very start of final fantasy 9, バクー says:我らの目指すはアレクサンドリア王国……I also saw some time ago "目指すは" used in a headline here:シャーラウィ「目指すはシーズン２０ゴール」There's also another example in the full version of 英辞郎:目指すはブーリ。…"Bulli was our destination"...Because I've seen it a number of times, I'm pushing towards that it is grammatical to use "目指す" in this way, but assuming that's the case, why is it possible to use it in this wayI've searched on the Internet and various dictionaries, but haven't been able to find an answer.  It seems strange that 目指す seems to be being used like a noun, and I would have thought it should need a nominalizer like as in "目指すのは"/"目指すことは", or that it should be written like "目指し" or something. Is it just a case of ellipsis, or is there something else going on here
I was looking for the verb しゃべる in the dictionary, as it got me curious since I've only known 話す for a while.In the dictionary there are two example sentences which look the same, but the dictionary gives two different meanings:彼女はよくしゃべる。She talks a lot.彼はよくしゃべる。He talks well.What They look exactly the same to me, except the personal pronoun but why does the meaning changes Is it a matter of "having both meanings" or what
From the title of a YouTube video:だるまさんが転んにゃFrom the song じょんから女節:春は私にゃ 遠すぎるI suspect the second usage might be a contraction of に and the 関西弁 copula や, but I'm not sure. Did the first one come from んにゃ &lt;= んや &lt;= んである
the "for" should be followed by an arbitrarily long and complicated sentence like:Thank you for waiting for me after the football match!orSorry for spilling my drink on the carpet that you got for your birthday.
Many verbs come in pairs, frequently but not always transitive/intransitive pairs. These verbs generally have multiple okurigana characters, but according to my dictionary one of the pair was formerly written with only one okurigana character. For example, 加える in bungo is written 加ふ. Some words, such as 抜く、have retained their original form, while also having more apparent derivations: 抜かる, 抜ける, and 抜かす.What are the general etymological rules that produced such words Am I correct in thinking that these are the result of compounding that may have resulted in semi-regular vowel elision in a previous state of the language
I came across this phrase while reading an interview.そういう時はなんて答えりゃいいんだ。I think it means "At a time like that, such a reply/response is good."But I don't understand the usage of りゃ. I couldn't find any reference as a suffix or conjugation.
I'm having some trouble to find the meaning of this word. I already saw this 2 times in a game and I can't find the meaning in any dictionary that I use.Examples:あやせ：「そうなると私のことなんか放っておいて…」京介：  ブチブチと文句を言ってくる…んだけど、あれ？なんだか言葉の切れ味が鈍いような…and...加奈子：「イイエ、ナンデモ」あやせ：加奈子はそのあともブチブチと何か言っていたけど…
I feel 活用 has some kind of feeling of "put to the use", as a politician would use his charm in a campaign.The other three seem confusing to me, however. What are the differences
I have always stuck with [探]{さが}す for "search", but in an anime I heard one of the characters sayインターネットを[検索]{けんさく}おねがいしてもいいですか。I suspect that one of the differences is that 検索 is more likely to be used when speaking of an internet search. Is that correct And are there any more differences between the two words
Why does the right side radical strokes order 踵　are different than 重 alone
I'm pretty new to Japanese and I have a question.So I know this is supposed to be something like "he differs from his former self" but I can't really make sense of what とは is supposed to mean in this particular situation:彼は昔の彼とは違う
I am looking for something that expresses the concept of self-cultivation, especially in the sense of "practicing self-cultivation through traditional japanese arts" (see also this book, which I don't own yet, but looks pretty close to what I mean).Would "自己修養" be correct Is there some different nuance that would alter the meaning for a Japanese speakerCan someone propose a different word for this(If I am not explaining my idea of "self cultivation" clearly enough, please comment and I'll try to make this better).
I have two textbooks, and they seem to give opposite definitions for 「〜というものではない」. The first one says it means "it's not just a matter"; while the other one says that[It follows] a statement to express that the speaker really feels the statement to be accurate or appropriate. [It emphasizes] the speaker's desire to convey the meaning of the statement or the essence of the matter discussed.My confusion manifests in the following example sentences, which appear to have almost opposite meanings given each explanation:この病気は寝ていれば治るというものではない。相手が好きだから結婚できるというものでもない。From what I understand, I would translate them either (using the first explanation) asCuring this disease isn't just a matter of resting in bed.You cannot marry your partner just because you love him/her.or (using the other explanation) asI really think that resting in bed will cure you of this disease.I really think that you can marry your partner because you love him/her.Can someone fill me in on the points I'm obviously missing Thank you.Edit: I checked with my teacher; and she agrees with the two answers below. Thanks again!
I've sent some pictures to a Japanese friend, and she replied saying カッコいいじゃーん. I don't get either the Hiragana and Katakana mix in that word as the last じゃーん...Could anybody please get me out of the doubt
I'm a bit confused in the usage as "possession" of time.I know 時間 is time and 時 would be more like when, but...Some thing's time would be Jikan or toki If it was someone, would it still be the sameFor example, bike's time could be バイクの時 As if, "when I'm on the bike" And, Anna's time would still be アンナの時？As if, "when I'm with Anna" Or would that be wrong
Why does てはいけない use は I know it's a construction, but where did it come from て form verbs are not nouns, it doesn't make sense to me that は could be used with them.
When said in English, this sentence means that you have class in the near future, despite using now. Is it okay to omit から in the sentence below, or does that change the meaning今から授業があるので、行かなければならない。またね。
Often I see people write urusai to mean annoying, and I've also seen meiwaku, but I was wondering if there was an adjective closer to meaning annoying. Mendokusai means bothersome, but in a different sense, right
My dictionary says they are both cure/fix, so I am wondering what the difference is and how to use themIs it an active/passive difference, or transitive/intransitive Or just a subtle nuanceI couldn't find a good example of usage.I found this question, but it just refers to the different kanji, not the different words.Thanks
I came across someone describing a Nihon yamori / gekko as a 益虫, and using  "useful insect" in English. Gekkos aren't insects, but it made me curious what it actually does mean.jisho.org only describes 益虫 as meaning "useful insect". The English edition of Wiktionary lacks a description of 益虫, has a terse description of its antonym 害虫 (harmful insect), and a slightly longer definition of 虫, but not one that'd cover gekkos.What kind of organisms would be covered by 益虫, 害虫, or 虫, and what kind of animals wouldn't be covered by 虫(BTW: I'm aware that English has words for non-monophyletic groups, so no mockery is intended)
Is the に particle in ように consistent in all its usesFor example...1/明日は晴れるように   or覚えるようにしますI understand the に here to be a target particle for what you are wishing for or trying to achieve.2/先生のように教えるHere it seems like it is more like it is making よう into an adverbial form.Is there an interpretation that encompasses both uses
I am watching a certain show at the moment where someone is talking about wanting to kill evil creatures. Please don't judge this question as childish just because the extract is from an anime.He saysくちくしてやる。この世から。一匹残らずI understand that, but then he saysもっとだ。もっと。もっと殺したい。I don't understand why he would say もっとだ. The reason why is that I don't know what he is saying exists as 「もっと...」, if you understand what I mean. I know the meaning of the word, I just don't get why he would say だ afterwards.Like, if I asked in Japanese I would say... 何が「もっと」ですか？What would replace 何 in that questionIs だ just emphasis of how much he wants to kill more
Like in English we could type the days of the week as "Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat."Does Japanese have shortenings for weekdays Like:日,月, 火, 水, 木, 金, 土Instead of:日曜日, 月曜日, 火曜日, 水曜日, 木曜日, 金曜日, 土曜日Or:にち, げつ, か, すい, もく,きん, どInstead of:にちようび, げつようび, かようび, すいようび, もくようび, きんようび, どようびOr do the short versions not make sense
I found the following dialogue on lang-8:A: 駄目だ、飲み過ぎて頭が回転しない。  B: 仕事、明日にしたら？A: Oh no, I drank too much so I can't concentrate on it.  B: Why not do your work tomorrowSo does 頭が回転する　mean "able to concentrate" or am I misunderstanding it In English when ones head spins, it is a euphemism for being drunk or dizzy but I guess in Japanese having ones head revolve quickly (maybe describing the speed of thoughts turning over/ideas coming) equals being quick-witted. Would anyone be kind enough to explain this idiom
I'm having trouble with the translation of  終わらせている in the following sentence, and as far as I understand it likely translates here as "die". But I never found this meaning for 終わる in vocabulary, and why is it in させる form 「ええ・・・・・・摩夜さんこそ、犯人が狙う本命だと思うんです」  「いったい・・・・・・誰がそんなことを・・・・・・？」   「それは・・・・・・」  ついさっきまで、詩音さんがやっていると思っていた。 でも彼女は死んでしまった。   だとしたら摩夜さんはもう安全だと思うのだけど・・・・・・  それともーー既に終わらせているのだろうか・・・・・・？Some sort of translation: "Until a moment ago, I though it was Shion-san. But she is dead. In this case I think that Maya-san is safe now...  or - already dead."
Usually resumes contain the "Objective" paragraph which provides the summary of things a person thinks he does best and what he wants to do. Will simply using 目的{もくてき} work or there is a more specific term.
I'm watching an anime where the protagonist says, according to the subtitles, "that must be it!" But what it sounds like he's saying "あれが" instead of "あれだ". I know I may be hearing incorrectly, but is it possible for "あれが" to be said in a way that would translate to "That must be it"
What is the difference between tatami mat counters 帖 and 畳 (both pronounced じょう)
I apologize in advance for the poor title. I'm really not sure how to phrase my question. I often see in Japanese sentences structures like the following:エホバに関するどんな事実を強調しましたか。In the above, エホバに関する (let's call it 'A') seems to stand on it's own as some clause that, to my eye, doesn't seem clearly attached to the remainder of the sentence. Then we have どんな事実を強調しましたか ('B') that makes sense on it's own (e.g. 'B' meaning "What facts were highlighted")Is, エホバに関する, modifying どんな in this caseIn many Japanese sentences, I often see a clause ending in plain form that just sits before (or after) the rest of the sentence. But it's not joined to the remainder of the sentence with any particle like の, こと, ため, によって, etc. So it's simply "A + B" with no particle to join them and it doesn't always look like an adjectival clause.Am I just confused Is the above just an adjectival clause for どんな or is this a common structure I'm just not aware of(P.S. Please let me know if I need to provide more examples.)
The word 小説{しょうせつ} seems to be used as a translation of "novel", but it is composed of the characters for "small" and "opinion/rumour/theory". I have seen it used to describe works such as 芥川龍之介{あくたがわりゅうのすけ}'s "羅生門{らしょうもん}", which in English would probably be considered a short story, to 中里介山{なかざとかいざん}'s "大菩薩峠{だいぼさつとうげ}", which I believe was at one point the longest novel ever written. From what I can tell, any work of prose fiction can be called a 小説 regardless of its length. If that is the case, what is the origin of the word
I am well aware of how に works compared to で and how to use it in various situations.I still have trouble with a few uses that keep popping up, as they don't seem to gel with my current understanding.For example それは体に悪いですI see に as a particle that shows 2 things,A particle that denotes movement form larger area to settle in somewhere specific.It is used with verbs like 住む　勤める　and 乗る for this reason.A particle that effectively turns the noun or quasi adjective into an adverbial phrase.Used with 静かにしてください　ハンバーガーにします etc to show the way you will "do" for want of a better word. It also is used in passive phrases to show that it was by someone else's motions that something happened, like "田中さんにビールが飲まれた"So my question is, how do I understand phrases like 体にいいです or 会社に行くのにバスと電車を使っているIs that a third usage meaning "for"BONUS QUESTION:Are there any other usages of に I should look out for
This may be slightly multifaceted because I have a larger question regarding で that is contextualized by a smaller one.It is improper to put で before です or だ　right. If someone asks 何で来ましたか (How did you get here) you could reply バスで来ました。 But you can't write バスでです... right Is there a way to answer without a verbOk that's my contextual question... so my real question is, if it is true you cannot place で before です in this manner, how is it possible to say 初めてです　if that is the 連用形 + で.Or is it a completely different thing all together and just considered an adverbSUMMARY:1/ Can you place で before です per example: バス　＋　で　＋　で　＋　あります.2/ If not... how is it possible to say 初めてです, as to me that is 初め　＋　で　＋で + あります
How would I express a verb acting upon another verb For example, 'I love to dance', or 'I hate to fight!' Would you say:喧嘩するを憎むよ喧嘩してを憎むよ喧嘩するのを憎むよ喧嘩しを憎むよAre any of these correct If not, how would you say it Are there variations to choose from, or only one correct way to do it.
So  明け方 means "dawn," but if looked at more closely, is the literal meaning of 明け方, "in the direction of dawn"I think this is wrong, but I can't remember which meaning of 方 is taken here.Is it the meaning of 方 as 様子 or "state," as in "the state of dawn/light breaking"Also, what is the difference in tone and usage between 明け方 and 明け ( when  明け is used as "dawn")
I bought these plums at a supermarket in Kyoto today and noticed that they were labeled プルーン (prune). According to jisho.org, a plum is a プラム. Is it common to not distinguish between prunes and plums in Japan
I've got a question regarding difference in usage of 辞書形+ように and 辞書形+ために with verbs' dictionary forms, i.e. 飛行機に乗り遅れないように、前日早寝したのです。彼は質問をするために手を上げました。The notion I get is that the first is used with non-action verbs, while the latter form is used with action verbs. Am I correct
This is not intended to be a controversial or provocative question.In English, there are "commonly accepted" stereotypes for how gay people sometimes speak. Are there corresponding characteristics to how gay Japanese people speak, either specific words, phrases, or constructs; or in how certain sounds are inflectedI'm curious if Japanese is as permissive as English in "allowing," for example, gay men to use more feminine speech forms, or if the strictures of the language and culture pretty much tie all genders to prescribed speech patterns regardless of sexual orientation.Examples of words, phrases, or sentences that are clearly recognized as "gay" would be appreciated. For example, in the US, it is not uncommon for some gay men to call each other "girl." As another example, per the link above, sometimes gay men (especially when speaking excitably) have a distinctly melodic or tonal-variadic inflection. Things like this that might parallel to Japanese (or completely unique instances) are what I'm curious about.
While 制限 seems rather straightforward, the others don't seem as easy to pinpoint to me.What are the differences, and in which cases should I one over another
I know ため can be translated into English as "for" such-and-such.But is it appropriate to use it to thank some one for doing something For example, "Thank you for your email address." Would it be grammatically accurate to say: メールアドレスためありがとうございます。Google translate seems to understand the sentence perfectly fine. But would a native speaker scratch their head at that use of ため in this manner
I have been trying for ages to understand the reason という is used so frequently.  In other words, what does it add to the sentence and what connotations does it have in Japanese I understand the meaning of each word individually in many of the set phrases it belongs to, but if you were forced to name who it is doing the いう'ing, would it be the speaker, Japanese society or just some abstract entityAll I've found are silly and questionable English translations like:今日のテーマは愛という事だ  "Today's lesson is the thing they call love"The problem for me arises when I see just how often stuff like ということ appears in conversation, even twice in a sentence, like:彼が金を貸してくれたということは私は彼に信用されているということだ。Why isn't it just 彼がお金を貸してくれたことはI was hoping someone could give me a (hopefully in-depth) understanding based more in how it is understood in Japanese. Even a link to a good Japanese explanation or a summary would do.
Are there any rules or guidelines as to when to pronounce 行く as いく or ゆくI looked it up on jisho.org, and the two pronunciations have the exact same definition. I tend to hear ゆく more often in songs, but that is just anecdotal.
人気アイドルにあやかって昨年上位を占めた「たくや」君はベストテン圏外。I am confused by the usage of 圏外 in this sentence. My translation would be:I was named after a popular idol, Takuya, who was at the top of popularity rankings, outside the top 10.The fact that the idol was outside the top ten most popular idols is strange given that he already said "at the top". I would understand if there was a "but", as in "at the top, but not in the top 10". The way it is currently, it seems like "outside top ten" is somehow reinforcing the "at the top" part, which doesn't make sense logically. Clarification: This sentence is part of an explanation about self introductions and にあやかって means 'named after' in this context.
I've got troubles with modifying 後ろを付いていく in the following sentence. Can somebody please explain this part for me. As far as I understand the sentence "Kicking around piled up snow, I'm following him."As always thank you very much.
I was watching a TV drama, and one line was:「熊出来てる」I would translate it as "seems like a bear is coming out". In context, it seems to refer to a person who has rings under their eyes, due to not getting enough sleep, working too late into the night, etc.But I am wondering how a bear relates to the meaning of this phrase. Thought I would ask at the risk of it being too narrow a topic.
In English we say things like:What is the best way to &lt;verb&gt; somethingI understand 方法{ほうほう} as a method and 方{かた} after verb stem. The sentence that caused me to contemplate was (in English):What is the best way to ask for directions in JapaneseOr "What is the best way to say weird/strange in this sentence"(Sort of assumes the listener knows the English words strange or weird.)My thoughts were something like:”weird/strange” という[一番]{いちばん}いい[方法]{ほうほう}なんですか。
I tried using this expression but a friend of mine who lives in Japan said it is feminine. I tried searching about this online but couldn't find any indication that it is. Is it really feminine if it is, how do guys express excitement/elation
is there the same expression in Japanese for good russian idiom 'Сердце кровью обливается'｢心は出血している｣'My heart is bleeding' is not very accurate, not really verbatim. This idiom in Russian describes not such feeling like sadness of brokenhearted one, but deep empathy in sorrow.
I've been thinking about the word 「大雨」and can't seem to ignore the kanji「大」in it. Why does 「大雨」mean 「大量に降る雨」 (a great quantity of rain) Wouldn't something like 「多雨」be more appropriate When I was first studying Japanese, and I saw the word 「大雨」my first impression was that it meant "the rain drops were large". Is there any reason why 「大」 in 「大雨」 was chosen to represent that "there is a lot of rain"
I am reading something but I can't decipher the meaning of this: よーちぇん時から忘れた事ないぞ、みーくん and おらんThe first one I can grasp the sense since it tells Mi-kun not to forget the time but  よーちぇん is affixed before 時. Upon searching google, many of the searches returns something about time like "おはよーちぇんだよ".On the second one, I am confused if this means "I" as おら is a northen dialect for 俺. However, the speaker speaks in Kansa-ben so maybe that's not it. I know there's おる in Kansai-ben which means いる in standard dialect. With ん affixed to it, does it mean negates おる
first time asking a question on here. What is the difference in meaning between 人々、人物、人、人類、人間　and if you know any others it would be nice to include those too.How do you use them properly
According to the dictionary, both of these terms refer to the same object: car/automobile.Now, I understand that 車 is also used in compounds to provide the "vehicle" part as in 電車, but I'm just referring to the meaning "car" in this question.Is there really a difference between these two terms Register Formal/informal None
When writing or reading a sentence in Japanese, does the word 「よう」 have a nuance any different to using 「ように」 For example, sentences using 「ように」:好きなように踊ってよろしい。落第しないように一生懸命勉強しなさい。君の将来が幸せでありますように。ちょっと怒ったようにきこえた。For example, sentences using 「よう」:まるでボスのような話し方をする。君は自分のためになるような書物を読べきだ。ここには、誰もいないだよ。映画を見たようです。学生のようだ。
What does 'よ' do when placed after a single noun like '今'今よWould it be considered a question, like "Now"
I'm wondering what the か in か弱い, か細い and similar words is. It seems to act as an intensifier. The Daijisen tells me simply that this か is a 接頭語, and translates it as いかにも; it doesn't seem to have its own entry or any further explanation. Speculations online seem to include:it is a corruption of 小【こ】, and so is a simple intensifierit implies "obviously 弱い・細い by sight"My question: what does this prefix mean, and where does it come from (For bonus points: can anyone give me some more examples, and is this prefix still productive)
I understand that ことはない is used to state that something does not have to be done, such as:時間は十分あるから急ぐことはない。However, I am currently translating a survey from Japanese to English for a friend and this phrasr is popping up often and I am not sure if I am translating it correctly. (He is a pyscology student if that matters). Here are a couple examples that I am struggling with:私は道にポイ捨てしたことはない。or自分の失敗をもみ消したことはない。The second seems more straight forward, 'I don't need to hide my mistakes', but if that is the case, what is happening with the past tense of する？ Why is it もみ消した and not もみ消す？ my understanding is that when using this ことはない grammar point, the verb remains in dictionary form.The same applies for the second, example, is this saying I don't need to litter  Or rather that I don't litter Or...I'm a bit lostCan anyone help meP.S. I apologize for any formatting errors, I am doing this on my iPad and it does not love this website.Thanks!
For example in the sentence:書くだけでいいですか.
In a quiz, I got a question where one had to complete with に、を、で or が the following sentence:この道（？）まっすぐ行ってください。The correct answer being:この道をまっすぐ行ってください。It always seems more natural to me to put で here instead of を as 道 describes where the action will take place.Could anyone please give me the reason behind this choice in Japanese
おわってなさすぎThere's te-form for owarimasu, and I see sugiru form. What does the "nasasugi" part mean
As far as I can tell, they both mean something like stretch or extend. When would you use each one
I've seen all four used in the context of something being finished. What's the difference between them
I'm a beginner and I would like to know how あまり is used.
What I want to convey is "It truly is painful ((for me)), to think that I might actually have caused you pain."(((( Or to make it clearer, other ways of saying it: "I truly find it painful to consider the possibility of myself having been yet another reason for your pain." /"It is truly painful for me to consider that I might in fact have caused you additional suffering." ))))))I have the following translations:私は実際にあなたに痛みを引き起こさせてしまったことをしたことを考えるだけでも辛いです。るとことも痛いです。私が君のことを傷つけてしまった かも知れないと思うと、本当に心が沈みます。もしかして〇〇さんを悩[なや]ませてしまったことを考[かんが]えると、私も悩…--I think the first or the second translationare the best, the last one is kind of incomplete as of now, but basically which of these is the most correct/precise one Any idea
Historically where did all of these different forms arise, and when are they used I noticed that だ and である both have their place in different 文法形, what is the difference in their meaning I know that in things like 論文 as well as, apparently, on Wikipedia である is used, but I really don't know why.
From what I understand, 〜っぽい, 〜がち, and 〜やすい all seem to suggest that someone has a general tendency towards doing something. It seems that 〜っぽい and 〜がち can attach to a noun or to the 連用形 of a verb, while 〜やすい can attach to the 連用形 of a verb.All three can be used in a sentence such as:彼女は大事なことを忘れっぽい。彼女は大事なことを忘れがちだ。彼女は大事なことを忘れやすい。Is there a difference in meaning between these phrases
Straightforward question.  天爾遠波 (or 弖爾乎波) - written as てにをは - is a term used to refer to the Japanese particles (助詞) or sometimes Japanese grammar as a whole (文法).  So how to do pronounce the は at the end  Is it ワ or ハ  Presumably it's the former since it's describing particles, but I've never seen it definitively explained anywhere.
I've seen both refered to as "match". Is there some secondary usage or perhaps a connotation or nuance that separates the two
為替　is a money order or exchange rate. How did they pick these two kanji From what I can tell, it's not kunyomi, onyomi, ateji, or gikun.
I've been trying to work out the usage of にともなう, にともなって, and so on, but am having difficulty understanding the difference between placing the particle の after a verb and before にともなう. One grammar resource that I have only gives the usage with の as examples, while another only gives the usage without it as examples.The first gives as an example: マラソン大会が行われるのに伴って、この道路は通行止めになります。The second gives as an example: 秋が深まるにともなって、山の紅葉が進む。Is there a general rule for when to use each of these patterns
It seems strange to me that in Japanese the preferable question is どういう意味 while in English we ask "what is its meaning", rather than, "how do you say it's meaning." Although you can ask 何とかの意味は何、 can you say 何とかはどういう意味？ This statement of making meanings how's and not what's is difficult for me to understand. Any suggestions
I hear って everywhere, and in the case of っていう I heard it was a shortening of という. But in the case of things like questions, where does って come from, and what exactly does it mean
I was trying to say " I am unfortunately getting frustrated." which seemed to suggest some combination of 挫折してしまいました　and ざせつしています but I can't seem to figure out how to put these together.Any suggestions
In some song lyrics I was reading it said 飛んでけ; and I was curious as to what the け meant. The translation just says leap out.
For example, Natsukawa Rimi's 島唄 has this has most of the verbs in plain 連用形 with no apparent reason:でいごの花が咲き　風を呼び　嵐が来たでいごが咲き乱れ　風を呼び　嵐が来たくり返す悲しみは　島渡る波のようウージの森であなたと出会いウージの下で千代にさよなら島唄よ　風に乗り　鳥とともに　海を渡れ島唄よ　風に乗り　届けておくれ　私の涙  etc etc君をのせて from Castle in the Sky has English word order:父さんが残した 熱い想い /母さんがくれた あのまなざしThe way I understood that line it is equivalent to父さんが熱い思いを残した / 母さんがあのまなざしをくれたthough I might be wrong and this is just two noun phrases standing by themselves.The most weird song that I often listen to is いつも何度でも from 千と千尋の神隠し. The first stanza:呼んでいる　胸のどこか奥で /いつも心踊る　夢を見たいI understand it as follows:胸のどこか奥から　よんでいる。いつも心が踊ってる。夢を見たい。Though I might be wrong.Some of the lines are half-grammatical but have weird meanings (Words I filled in to understand in brackets):繰り返すあやまちの　そのたび（だ。）ひとはただ青い空の　青さを知る(Yeah right, knowing that blue sky is blue.)果てしなく（い？）　道は続いて見えるけれどこの両手は　光を抱けるさよならのときの　静かな胸（がある）ゼロになるからだが　耳をすませる(Why would a "body tending to zero" "fill up ears" I'm reminded of http://what-if.xkcd.com/50/ ...)
In the following saying:時は金なり。What exactly is なり My dictionaries seem to give a number of different options that could all explain its use here.Is it 成る Is it 也, an archaic version of です or ある If so, does that mean that in the past, Japanese verbs did not all end in the う-sound
I recently read a quote from architect Sverre Fehn that stated:"Japan has a word for finding the pleasantest point in an interior..."I was wondering if anyone might know what this word is.
Question to anyone who listens to J-pop-In Kyary Pamyu Pamyu's song にんじゃりばんばん、 what does the りばんばん mean- or where could it have possible came from
I'm wondering if と, that the Dictionary of Basic Japanese Grammar says lead to a uncontrollable event, is, in addition to this, used with the meanning of a fact that will for sure happen if the condition is met.I ask because I am unsure if sentences with hypotheses in the main clause can be used with と, like:雨が降ると、明日の試合は中止するかもしれない。  If it rains, tomorrow's match might be canceled.この間食を摂ると、お腹がいっぱいになるでしょう。  If you take this snack, you probably will be full.Moreover, can you use conjecture with と This phrase, for instance, sounds weirdカナリアの鳴き声がよく聞こえないと、耳が遠くなってきたようです。  If I cannot hear well the cries of canaries, it will appears that I am going deaf.
I am trying to understand the grammar behind "[noun]って".I looked up some examples on space alc web, and 人って seems to mean people, someone, or some person. I have seen other examples of the [noun]って usage, so I guess its common but probably I am missing something.
In programming, a function can have optional parameters, for instance getTemperature() could have an optional parameter "Unit" to say I want the temperature in Kelvin for instance. By default, when specifying no parameter, it would be in Celsius.How to say optional parameters in JapaneseALC says オプションのパラメータ:Both required and optional parameters are listed.  必須なパラメータおよびオプションのパラメータを列挙します。But I believe they are wrong, and their translation has a different meaning.
What is the difference between  防ぐ and 予防する To me both of them seem to mean "to prevent".A Japanese person once explained to me how they are different but unfortunately I don't remember.Similar question: What is the difference between 防止 and 予防
I hear both fairly often but i still can't tell the difference and when to use what.I found this answer in yahoo answers but it seems like there is a difference in opinion () - not sure, didn't understand some of the answers. I usually hear omoidashita (思い出した) when someone suddenly recalls something. And I am sure I heard oboetenaino (覚えてないの) a few times and to me it seems like the person is saying: "you don't remember do you". So it seems to me that they both mean the same thing. Is this correctFor example:Person1: 覚えてないのPerson2: 思い出せないIs this validSo I guess my questions are:Do they mean the same thingAre they interchangeable
This question already has answers here:                                            What are the guidelines of omitting particles                                (3 answers)                            Closed 7 years ago.So I have this book, "Easy Japanese, A Direct Learning Approach for Immediate Communication".I notice that は is often omitted in sentences.So instead of saying:猫はどこですか。It might read:猫どこですか。Is the omitting of は valid It definitely would seem like the sentence is still easy to understand without the は. And I've sometimes felt that the は can start to feel repetitive, so I'd be happy to know if I can omit the は at times.But would the Japanese actually speak this way Because if not I want to avoid such a habit.
剣 by itself can be read either way. What's the difference Clarification: In particular, when 剣 refers to a 諸刃 sword, which reading are natives more likely to use
I find myself in situations where I wanna express 'I feel like.. Puking(verb), eating(verb) pizza, I feel old (adj), etc' How are these best expressed in Japanese
I was playing some game where one has to choose the appropriate preposition.In the sentence below, は is the correct answer as per the game but I got confused and didn't understand why は is the correct one from the options に、は AND で。にほんは　ぶっかが　たかいです。
I've heard it thrown about in different contexts, but I never quite under neither what it does or what dictates when the sound changes to じゅう in a context, as in 世界中. Anyone have any ideas
So at my office i see both [実施]{じっし}する and [実行]{じっこう}する used a lot to mean "carry out" a task.Any time I ask a Japanese person they tell me "they are the same".Can anyone tell me any differences in usages, or any specific cases where one is preferred over the other Or any specific nuances one impliesSome examples straight from my email inbox: 以下のコマンドを実行してください。 バッチの再実行をしました。バッチを毎時0分に実施します。忘年会を実施することになりました。結合テストケースを実施します。
If I ask, "Can I borrow a pencil" I might say: エンピツを借りてもいいですか？Why do we use the も particle here, since we're not saying also this or that To express also is the main usage of mo I'm familiar with.
The usual situation with multiple kun readings for a kanji is that they are closely related in meaning (like [上]{あ}がる, [上]{のぼ}る). But with [着]{き}る and [着]{つ}く I fail to see any semantic connection. Why is the same character used Did one of the meanings formerly use another character that became the same by simplification
I'm having troubles with distinguishing between passive voice and potential voice in the following sentences, help me please.鍔姫：「だから、弟が幼稚園の頃、母に頼まれて、よく風呂にいれていてだな。その、だから見慣れているというか」幼稚園の頃……？それと比べられて平気って、おい。鍔姫：「いや、別に沢山見ているわけではないが！ 何もかも平気というわけでもないが……」鍔姫：「あ、いや、今は平気だった。別に気分など悪くしてないからな！ 断じてしていない！」”ファントム”の称号を与えるのは問題かとも思ったが……」マグワイヤ「もう異論はない。彼女こそ”ファントム”」マグワイヤ「我がインフェルノのトップ＝スナイパーだ」サイス「いえ、どれもこれも、ミズ＝マッキェネンの後ろ盾があればこそ、成し遂げられた成果です」マグワイヤ「良い部下を待ったな、クロウディア」クロウディア「……」Some sort of translation: pic1 - When he was in kindergarten  I was compared with him(this), and she  is saying "everything is fine", hey. - passive.When he was in kindergarten  She could compare me with him(this),  and she is saying "everything is fine", hey. - potential.pic2 - The results has been achieved only because of Miss McCunnen's help. -  passive.We() were able to do it only because of Miss McCunnen's help. -  potential.As always thank you very much for help!
From what I read, 厚い is used when something is thick or abundant and 篤い is used when describing a serious illness. But what confuses me is that in a dictionary (Tagaini Jisho) both of these are in the same entry, is it because the kanji can be interchangeable Is 篤い commonly used And which kanji would be used for the second definition hospitableThe entry:厚いAlternate writings: 篤い (あつい)Thick, deep, heavy. [ 厚い (あつい) ]Kind, cordial, hospitable, warm, faithful.Serious (of an illness). [ 篤い (あつい) ]Abundant. [ 厚い (あつい) ]
When using の, I'm well aware that "X の Y" means "Y of X", and the modification expands leftward, per se. However, I've come across some select examples where I'm confused at the order of the words, and feel like what is A の B should be B の A.The one I'm struggling with is: 雪の冬. I wanted to know how to say "winter snow," and I'm not sure why[雪の冬] is correct. It seems like it should mean "winter of snow", or "snow's winter" -- while more intuitively I feel like 冬の雪 should mean "winter snow," as it seems to convey "snow of winter," or "winter's snow."I asked a friend who said something about apposition, but I still feel like that would translate winter snow as 冬の雪, and not 雪の冬. What am I missingAny help would be appreciated! I'd love some light shed on this mystery of の.
I came across the term 「意匠ノート」as a type of notebook. Translated, I guess it would be a "design notebook," but I'm not sure what that means A drawing book A notebook with graph paper for architectural designing If anyone has any insight,  would appreciate it!
I have these two sentences in my JLPT practise book. They are in different sections, so the book isn't making a deliberate comparison, but I couldn't help but wonder about the similarities.彼女{かのじょ}は学生{がくせい}時代{じだい}、先輩{せんぱい}に憧{あこが}れていた。学生{がくせい}時代{じだい}、彼女{かのじょ}は先輩{せんぱい}を慕{した}っていた。Both more or less translate to, "In her school days, she yearned for her superior." The use of "superior" in this context sounds awkward in English, but it'll do, as it's not the focus of my question.What I'm wondering is if there is any meaningful difference between the two sentences In the first, 憧{あこが}れる is an intransitive verb, so I'm guessing it emphasizes her as a source of the feelings. In the second sentence, 慕{した}う takes a direct object, so I'm guessing that emphasizes the superior as the target of her affections.However, in English, saying "she yearned for him" and "he was yearned for by her" similarly puts grammatical emphasis on different parts of the sentence, but the resulting difference in meaning is negligible, if it even exists. It's just two grammatical ways to get to the same point.The words also have different nuance, in that in my dictionary they both list "yearn for" as the first definition, but 憧{あこが}れるleans more toward "admire" and 慕{した}う leans more toward "adore". I'm unclear on how strongly they differ in that regard, and in any case, in this context, the two ideas overlap a lot. In both cases it seems we're talking about a woman with some kind of affection for a person at her school.Is there any meaningful difference between these sentences If so, is it the grammatical construct that differentiates them Is it the nuance 憧{あこが}れる and 慕{した}う Both
I just went out for lunch with a friend and when the waiter asked what we want to drink, I ordered 'お[水]{みず}下さい' whereas I noticed my friend asked for 'お[冷]{ひや}下さい'. Which expression would be more common or is there some distinction on who, where or when to use either oneよろしくお願いします
I've always been puzzled over why 大きい isn't 大い and 小さい is not 小い. Is there some etymological reason (I'm suspecting historical conjugations that changed the き and さ too, just like why 食べる has the べ since it used to alternate with ぶ; is this true)Similar weird okurigana are か in 静か, か in 暖かい. Is there some historical reason that caused しず and あたた to be seen as more central to the word than the か following it (which does not conjugate)
I always thought that 坊 in 朝寝坊する was a bit weird. At least in Chinese, 坊 means "small factory". Thus I assumed it was a pun about "went to work at the morning sleeping factory" though it seems a bit far-fetched. How come it is not just 朝寝する or even 朝寝る
So, I'm going to Japan as part of the JET Programme, and will be staying in Minamiaizu, Fukushima Prefecture.While I have about 18 months of Japanese, these were mostly night classes, and I could really use more daily practice (.... which I'm expecting to get); I've been informed that the local area has their own dialect - what am I going to end up learning (not necessarily deliberately), and what's going to be different for me  What are the characteristics of the local dialect(If it helps, the class was using this series, which I'm assuming is teaching 'Tokyo standard' Japanese)
In the Hyakunin Isshu, the 17th poem (found here) has me stumped. In the manga/anime ちはやふる, the title is written and pronounced as ちはやふる, but on the card for the game the manga revolved around (also found here) it is written as ちはやぶる in furigana. Is it pronounced as ちはやふる or ちはやぶる If it's ちはやぶる, then why is the title of the manga ちはやふるEDIT:　Saw on the second-to-last sentence I wrote ちはやふる twice... glad you guys knew what I meant :)
Why can -たて attach to some verbs and not others What is a more precise definition of how to use itI had been aware of the suffix -たて as meaning 'an action just/newly completed/occurred' for a while but I covered it in my textbook more formally today. It attaches in the form of 連用形+たて. For example,    焼きたて  = freshly baked    とりたて  = freshly picked    ペンキ塗りたて  = newly painted  However, my book also stated that you can't say the following.    読みたて    寝たて    食べたて  If the definition above was correct, I should be able to use it for those words. That definition is also supported by the dictionaries I've looked it up in:Yahoo! Jisho  "動詞の連用形に付いて、その動作が終わったばかりであることを表す"Jisho.org  "indicates activity only just occurred; just (done)"
May I ask about the construction of this sentence 金欠で久しくスタバに行けてないけど・・・I know the meaning is along the lines of ...but I don't have any money and can't go to Starbucks."I understand スタバにいけてないけど.What I'm not sure I understand is the construction of 久しくスタバ. Is the adverbial form of 久しい used in the same way as the て form when multiple verbs are listed In other words, is 久しく essentially "for a long time, and..."Thank you for your help!
I have progressed pretty far in Japanese, but when I construct Japanese sentences, I still get these two particles mixed up. For example, when talking about being inside something, I don't know when to use "の中に" and when to use "の中で." Likewise, when speaking about being next to something, I sometimes don't know if I should use "となりに" or "となりで." How do you know which one to use in a sentenceWhich of these is correct部屋の中に泣いている。or部屋の中で泣いている。
Sorry if this has already been asked somewhere or if this is an unconstructive question...I feel that my English speech is sometimes a bit effeminate (in informal conversation, that is). I would like to replicate this in Japanese... I have often read (here on StackExchange, for instance) that this is not so permissible in Japanese, but is this really the case Are there any expressions/grammatical affectations/etc. that are considered feminine but can be used by menI understand also that the question is subjective... I tried my best to keep from flame-baiting...よろしくお願いします!

I'm not even certain that ないでいます is used, but if it is, what is it's difference from ていません They are both negation, but one is saying they are negating, and the other one is saying they aren't doing.Any help

I've noticed there appears to be a class of Japanese colors which are denoted by -色. Most of these literally translate to "noun-color" (brown = "tea color," grey = "ash color," etc.) It makes sense that, when describing the color brown, I would never simply say 茶 since that doesn't mean brown at all.The exception, of course, is 黄色, where 黄 itself does mean yellow. In names such as The Yellow River [黄河] the -色 is dropped. If it was not a proper noun -- such as a yellow house -- I would instead use the -い form of the color [黄色い家].My question is simply when it is appropriate to do this. Is 黄 used alone only in proper nouns Or can it be used very informally as 黄い家 or 黄の家 the same way I would say 赤い家 or 紫の家
Who knows the difference between 忘れてた and 忘れちゃった In what kind of situations you use each of those
The fermented rice alcohol called "sake" in English is usually referred to as 日本酒【にほんしゅ】 in Japanese, while 酒【さけ】 merely means "alcohol" in general.Yet, all dictionaries list both "alcohol" and "fermented rice alcohol/sake/nihonshu" as translations for the word 酒. Lately, I have noticed 酒 used a few times in movies to mean "nihonshu" specifically (e.g. with one character ordering a beer, and another ordering "sake").I imagine the use of 酒 for "sake" was the standard in ancient times (and only evolved after the introduction of other popular alcoholic beverages), but can anybody tell me if there is any modern context where it is still commonly used In such a case, would it be more or less formalEdit: Yuji's answer below also made me realise that the use of the polite form (お酒) might play a role in differentiating the two senses ()
I originally learnt 引っ越す to mean "to move house", but my textbook recently told me "移る" was also "to move house".Flaw also mentioned that 引っ越しする meant that too in chat, but that just looks like stem+する of 引っ越す, aka kind of politer.What are the differences between these words What are some situations when they are used over one another
I am a bit confused about this sentence I came across while studying:質問のある方はどうぞ。"Please feel free to ask any questions."I'm not sure about the "のある方" part of the sentence.My guess is that it would have to mean "to ask" in some way, but I can't figure out how. Is the の possessiveThank's for the help.
When one of my girlfriend asked her friend, if he is in Osaka now, he said "yes, that's right" (in japanese) and then "さすがお尻マイスター".I didn't understand it, but I didn't ask her or him back either. Now when I google it, さすが means "just what one would expect", お尻 is "butt" and マイスター is "Meister" in Katakana.But what does the combination of さすが お尻 マイスター meanI don't even understand the direct translation: "Just what I / you would expect from butt master".

〜ない functions the same way as an adjective, and so it can be conjugated to 〜なかった, 〜なくて, and so on. As far as I can tell, this is not case for 〜ぬ. Does it function as a standalone suffix, or is it able to be conjugated If so, how would one put it into the past tense, etcAlso, is the negative auxiliary 〜ん in Kansai dialect a contraction of 〜ぬ If so, does this form of the negative function in the same way as 〜ぬ

しかも is pretty straight forward:今度、「一番」ってお店のランチに行こうよ。あそこ、すごくおいしんだよ。しかも量もおおいよ。Let's go get lunch at Ichiban next time. The food is great, also the servings are big.うちの子は天才だよ。ピアノを弾くのが上手だ。しかも先月、英検２級を取った。My kid is a genius. He's great at playing the piano. What's more, last month he passed the 2nd grade of the Eiken.I think of しかも as 'Also', 'What's more', or 'On top of that'.The thing is I don't see how that is more different than それどころか. For example:この間食堂で食べた親子丼はひどかった。まず、にくはちゃんと焼いてなかったし、それどころかごはんは少なかった。I had a oyako-don at the dining hall and it was terrible. To begin with, the meat wasn't cooked properly, what's more, there wasn't a lot of rice.I have a feeling that the translation of the two phrases is not going to change very much when put into English, but that is not really important. What I want to know is the correct time to use each respective phrase. Or, are they not as interchangeable as I am thinkingThanks!
I understand that せいぜい has implies 'at most' or 'at best' such as:田中：今日、８時に横浜駅ね。仕事遅くならない？  加村：大丈夫だよ。いつも通りに終わるから、せいぜい７時半までしか残業しないから。However, in my notes I have my sensei saying that:*相手の能力などを低く考えている言い方：『だめだろうけど、せいぜい頑張って。』I am a little confused by this second usage, is it implying a sense of sarcasm or hopelessness towards the person being spoken Along the lines of 'the best you can do is try'If so, could you provide any other examples which illustrate this second meaningThank you!
The term 捉{とら}え直{なお}す has come up in three different essays in my JLPT practise book, and I can't determine exactly what it means.My understanding of 捉{とら}える is that it means "to catch, to capture", and my understanding of 直{なお}す is that it is "to fix, to restore". Of course, each of these has other meanings as well, but it hasn't helped me to try and consider the myriad combinations of each word's nuances."To capture and fix" "To catch and restore" The literal combination isn't very evocative.捉{とら}え直{なお}す doesn't have a direct entry in any dictionary I've looked, nor has a Google search come up with much.What does it mean, exactlyHere is an example sentence where it is used (though it may be a little opaque without the rest of the essay to support it):場所{ばしょ}に根{ね}を生{は}やし、場所{ばしょ}と接続{せつぞく}されるためには、建築{けんちく}を表象{ひょうしょう}としてではなく、存在{そんざい}として、捉{とら}え直{なお}さなければならない。WIthout having clarity about 捉{とら}え直{なお}す, my attempt to translate will be half-baked, but here is a rough attempt: "Cultivating the roots of a place, in order to connect with the area, not as an emblem of the construction, the reality (existence) has to be caught and repaired."
I'm a bit confused about how "しかい" is used in this sentence I came across while studying:そこには私一人しかいなかった。"I was the only one there."My guess is that it is an ending to "一人", but I couldn't find any information supporting that.

I was tonight with japanese friends and I noticed they rather used a simple 辞書形　form along with a raising tone to ask a question, although we learned in class that "non-polite" questions were formed with 辞書形+の. Is there a difference between the two  From this topic "Is ending question sentences with の really feminine" I gathered that の might have a feminine touch when used along with statements, but what about questions in general  Can I use の without sounding like a weirdo  I also heard the two, along with no-verb questions in an anime I'm currently watching, Ergo Proxy, but I guess these are used whenever the verb and/or subject are well defined by the context...

I cannot understand the meaning of 「人となり」 in the following sentence:人となり以前に壬生さんがあの幽霊の味方だったら不自然だって事だよ」「ほう？  なぜだ？」「アイツを逃がしたかったなら、壬生さん自身がいきなり追いかけたのは変ですSome sort of translation: If Mibu-san would be partner of that ghost than things that happened before seems strange. (Sorry for bad translation)
Does using the imperative form (i.e., よこす　→　よこせ) before と言う mean "[He] said I have/had to..."I saw this sentence used: シートが砂で汚れたから、クリーニング代よこせと言いました！I think this sentence basically means: Because I dirtied the seat with sand, [the taxi driver] said I had to pay the cleaning cost!So, can using the imperative form of a verb mean "...said I had to..."And, if that is true, then could I make the following sentences行けと言う：says I have to go野菜を食べろと言った：said I have to eat vegetablesお世話になります！
I encountered several sentences where に was used—from my deduction of the context—to enumerate things. For example a character about to go somewhere, checks his bag if he has everything he needs :2:「忘れ物は？」1:「大丈夫ー」1:「－だと思うけど確認しておこう」1:「バンデージにタオルに」1:「トランクス」  I tried searching this grammar but couldn't satisfy my curiosity. Why and how に is used to enumerate things I understand that it is basically used to tell the time, place, directions, cause, ect... But I'm lost on how to understand it used in that way.
Is there a disappointed or sad "boo" equivalent in JapaneseKind of like:Person 1: Hey man, can I borrow 10 dollarsPerson 2: Nah, I don't have any change.Person 1: Boo, now I don't have enough to go to the concert.
The example my book gives for an ungrammatical usage is "山田さんがくれば、いっしょに大阪に行きませんか？" I recognize that such things are the standard, but nowhere in any of my research is it indicated why that's the case, nor does it explain why sentences like "高ければ、買わない方がいいですよ。" are considered grammatical. Can anyone clarify this(as well as what falls under an ungrammatical will, wish, order or request, in this context)
I am very new to Japanese, but I noticed this today. In Wiktionary article on 一歩 we see that the pronunciation is いっぽ. In article for 一 we see that there is a nanori reading いっ. On the other hand in the article for 歩 we see that only sensible reading here would be ほ. But put together we get いっぽ. Also in Wikipedia article for っ, it says that sokuon won't appear before h, except in loanwords or nonstandard speech.So, why there appears to be a っ before h here And why does it appear to transform the ほ to ぽ
What's the difference between どんぐりの実 and どんぐり I read a passage where they said どんぐりの実 in reference to just an acorn (I thought), in which case I don't know why they wouldn't use just どんぐり.The passage was:形声。白は、どんぐりの実を描いた象形文字で、どんぐりの実の中みのあわく白い色を示す。泊は「水＋音符白」で、白の原義とは関係がない。水が浅くて舟底が水底にせまってとまること。また、水かさの少ない浅瀬のこと。 【泌】 　会意兼形声。必は、棒を両側からしめつけるさまを描いた象形文字。泌は「水＋音符必」で、両側から締めつけて液体をいびり出すこと。
I was looking up the etymology of 泊, and I got this:形声。白は、どんぐりの実を描いた象形文字で、どんぐりの実の中みのあわく白い色を示す。泊は「水＋音符白」で、白の原義とは関係がない。水が浅くて舟底が水底にせまってとまること。また、水かさの少ない浅瀬のこと。【泌】　会意兼形声。必は、棒を両側からしめつけるさまを描いた象形文字。泌は「水＋音符必」で、両側から締めつけて液体をいびり出すこと。I really don't understand what it means, in particular I don't know what 泌 and 音符必/白 means. I  know 音符　is note, and 泌 gets translated as secretion, but I can't understand this article. I also mentions the original meaning of 白, but I don't know what it's saying that meaning is.
I am currently in my third year of japanese studies, and in lesson 29 of 皆の日本語, we learned to use vb-て+しまいます　or しまいました　to emphasize the action or its completion, or the embarrassment, regret of the speaker. I now have an exercise, in which I need to complete the following sentence :私が結婚したかった人は、ほかの人と「Verb here」.Given the available verbs, I guess I have to add 結婚してしまいました、but would the meaning be rather : "I wanted to marry, so I am already married" or "I wanted to marry, but sadly I couldn't". Or maybe the exercise is just silly...Thanks in advance,ウルカン
Actually there are two instances of という　in this sentence (regarding the recent nsa scandal)そのスノーデンは、「ＮＳＡは中国に対するハッキングをやっていた」という[暴露]{ばくろ}を行なってアメリカの中国に対する「人権外交」にダメージを与えたり、Ｇ８会議が北アイルランドで始まるというタイミングで、...I understand the basic use of という　and it meaning "called" i.e.アダムという男性　the man called Adam.But what about in these two cases.
I can't quite figure out the differences between these two.I would guess that 食料 is only used in situations, where the only thing that matters is that the food is there or not there (As in, searching for food, gave food, need food)I've only seen 食品 used in connection to the process of making, acquiring, selling and storing the food.Am I on the right track here, or completely off

There are a ton of verbs with multiple readings and the exact same okurigana. Sometimes they mean totally different things and sometimes they have very similar meanings, so in the cases when they have similar meanings, how does one determine the reading To give just one example, 堪える:たえる, こたえる, こらえる, are all listed as common readings and mean 'to bear, endure'

I read a very detailed and useful answer explaining the difference between "に" and "には" but am still confused about a sentence I recently encountered.私たちには息子が二人います。I do not understand the function of には in this sentence. I get the general meaning -- that the speaker and their partner have two sons, but beyond that my brain is sort of melting. Please help. :c

I was reading http://helps.ameba.jp/faq/pigg/5301/post_362.html, and it said "ピグ", I can't for the life figure out for the life of me what it means (Unless it means pig, and contextually that makes no sense to me.)
I was reading this page: http://helps.ameba.jp/faq/pigg/5301/post_362.html and I found そっくりな, however my dictionary says it's an adverbial noun... and I though those took の as their particle-Then again, I just use の whenever I read noun because I assume it's an apposition.
What does  以下　mean in the following sentence, and how does it compare with 簡素 Could it be something "even less than plain..." 「狭い、簡素以下の、テーブルと椅子が二脚あるきりの部屋の中で、少女と向かいに座る中年の男は、お互いにむっつりと黙り込んだまま、かなりの時間を無駄にしていた。」

My daughter is in first grade at a public elementary school in Japan.In some homework yesterday, there was the appearance of the word ほおかむり. My Japanese isn't great as a non-native and she didn't know what it was, so we Googled it. Most results steered us towards ほおかぶり, which it seems this is a synonym of.It appears in the context it was presented to have meant the head covering ほおかぶり, is this simply another way of writing it
This is a brief dialog from the game Tales of Graces. In the English version, it goes:Sophie: Pascal, what's an airhead  Pascal: Someone who's so smart, they can control air with their mind!So I wanted to see how this joke would be executed in Japanese. So I found the dialog of the Japanese version, and it's:ソフィー：パスカル、のーてんきってなに？  パスカル：天気を毎日おんなじにしちゃう神様の特殊スキルだね。My best guess is "If the weather is the same every day, they get special powers from God", but I'm not entirely confident. I don't know how to parse the hiragana between 毎日 and 神様. Here is why I am having doubts:Since the verb しちゃう precedes the noun 神様 with no conjunction separating them, it seems like "天気を毎日おんなじにしちゃう" is an adjective clause modifying 神様.I've never seen 同じ written as おんなじ, so I'm not sure if it's just an alternate spelling, or a different word altogether.天気 is a direct object of しちゃう (because of the を) particle. I'm not sure what it means for 天気 to be a direct object to する。I'm not entirely clear on why the -ちゃう form is used for する. My understanding is that -ちゃう means something was done regrettably (or "finally", depending on the context), so I'm not sure how to fit it into the translation.Can anyone give me a translation, and if you can, clarify the points I listed
Why do we use particle に in the following sentences試合に勝つ・負ける。  試験に合格する・失敗する。  試験に出る。In case of 「試験に出る。」 is it because of the explanation 「に」は入る場所を表す。
I found Shimazaki Touson's work 'shiawase', and read the first few lines:「幸せ」が色々な家へたずねて行きました。だれでも幸せの欲しくないひとはありませんから、どこの家をたずねましても、みんな大喜びでむかえてくれるに違いありません。My question is how I can translateどこの家I understand that "doko" means "where", but in this position I can't imagine how to interpret.Thank you for reading my question.
A common insult, or at least, I've always understood it to be an insult, is to describe a woman as a マグロ in bed. Being referred to as マグロ, which is "tuna" in English, implies that a woman just lies there, unmoving and unenthusiastic about the sex which she is a part of.I came across this blog, and in a post about sex and flirting, the author states:For me, with my western sensibilities and preconceptions, calling  someone a ‘tuna’ in bed sounds like an insult, conjuring up images of  cold dead fish, but in Japan that word has a very positive  connotation. Tuna’s an expensive delicacy.The author's case, in summary, is that in sex in Japan, one partner is always passive, the receiver of what the other person does. One who lies there and takes it is therefor a good thing.I think this is a case of over-thinking the cultural implications, something that seems to plague so much of foreign analysis of Japan. As far as I've ever understood マグロ, when used by Japanese people, it is an insult, and not praise. These pages all seem to agree with me.But it's always good to question one's assumptions. The author claims verification from her Japanese friends.Am I right that it's always an insult, or is there anything to support what this blogger is saying about the use of the word(Note I am only asking about the definition of the word, not trying to open any discussion about passivity or other issues of sexual relations in Japan.)
I'm attempting to write a guide to understanding what is written on a Japanese Driving License for Wikipedia, but I've reached the limit of my reading comprehension abilities.Here's a labelled image of the sample license that is used by the National Police Agency in public information literature:I'm struggling with the abbreviated labels in the left-hand margin for sections 10, 11 and 12, and the list of abbreviated vehicle categories in section 13.Here is my best effort at translation. Would anyone be kind enough to correct and complete them It could well be that I've got some of these translations wrong: in particular, I think there might be something about automatic / manual transmission in there.Next to section 10: 二・小・原Date of issue of first small motorcycle licenseNext to section 11: 他Date of issue of first non-motorcycle licenseNext to section 12: 二種Date of issue of first motorcycle licenseFirst row of section 13, left-to-right:大型 Large vehicle中型 Medium vehicle普通 Ordinary vehicle大特 Large special vehicle大自二 Large motorcycle普自二 Ordinary motorcycle小特 Small special vehicleSecond row of section 13, left-to-right:原付 Mopedけ引 Trailer大二 Large commercial passenger-carrying vehicle中二 Medium commercial passenger-carrying vehicle普二 Ordinary commercial passenger-carrying vehicle大特二 け引二
The textbook I'm studying from lists [上]{あ}がる as "to go up", but I've previously learnt that [上]{のぼ}る also means "to go up".Jisho.org only lists "to go up" and any derivations of that as a single definition out of its 23 definitions for 上がる. I'm currently only wondering about when it means "to go up", but explaining the other definitions would be good too.Also, what are the differences between 上がる and the other kanji, 挙がる and 揚がる From my Chinese background, the other two seems to mean about the same, "to raise up something", but I want to confirm this for Japanese too. Jisho.org doesn't help much here either since it lists the same 23 definitions for all three, and doesn't provide any examples for the latter two.
What are the Japanese equivalent phrases for the phrase "I know, right!"The scenario is my friend said 「PS4には最高だね」, and I'd like to respond with something akin to "I know, right!" 「でしょ！？」 comes to mind but I'm unsure if it has the same effect.
I've been looking at futon recently and there's a particularly kind called the Shikibed or Shiki Futon. I was wondering where this "Shiki" was coming from.
I'm totally a beginner in Japanese. I'm confused about the pronunciation of 研修生. In the textbook, it's written as けんしゅうせい. When I listen to the tape, I found that う is not pronounced. Could anybody explain this phenomenon to meFurthermore, could somebody recommend a reference for this kind of pronunciation question
I found this example on lang-8, and wonder if anyone could clarify the use of 一応ね here:A: Are you going on Facebook or TwitterB: Just socially.A: FacebookとかTwitterやってる？B: 一応ね。When I look up 一応 on tangorin I get:いちおう  ichiou 【一応 · 一往】  adverb:  once;  tentatively;  in outline;  for the time being;  just in case;  so far as it goes過去問がもしあるならば一応目を通すほうがいいと思います。 If there are past exam questions then I think it would be best to give them a quick look over.I asked the original writer (native speaker) and he said that the translation was the meaning in his use of the phrase. Does this meaning exist in common usage and if so is the meaning as specific as the english phrase, "just socially"
I think of だ as being the only copula, which can be inflected to で and な. In my mind all other copula-like words are derived from these forms, i.e.です ⇔ であります  じゃない ⇔ ではない  だろう ⇔ であろう  etc.But is this (etymologically) reasonableAlternatively one could consider だ to be a contraction of である, which as far as I can tell can step in for だ anywhere, and consider で to be the "given" copula-like word (which may itself be simply a fancy use of the particle で...).Is it accurate to call な an inflection of だ Since である can also replace な anywhere (as far as I can tell), could it be possible that な and だ derive from the same word, which through sound change has come to be differentiated according to function (終止形 and 連用形)Are there any sources that would help corroborate/disprove these hypotheses
The following dialogue is from Final Fantasy XII:さて……王宮に忍びこむ方法じゃがな。まず５番倉庫に行ってみい。あそこに扉が２つあるじゃろう？I bolded 行ってみい.  I'm not sure what this is, and there's no dictionary entry for みい.  My guess is that it's a dialect form of 行ってみよ with the last vowel dropped.  I think that without the /o/ at the end, /miy/ becomes /miː/.  Does this make any senseHere's a picture from the game:
これっ！　石を投げるんじゃあないっ！  すいちゃったものはしかたがないじゃあないのっ！I've been reading a light novel called Slayers, and I noticed something interesting: the author usually writes じゃあない and not じゃない.  I'm curious if there are any differences between the two.  (I think it's clear that they have the same basic meaning, so I'm mainly asking about differences other than meaning, like style/formality/dialect.)Not long ago, I read a post on sci.lang.japan by the linguist Bart Mathias, which I'd like to quote here.  He describes the contraction from ては to ちゃ:Because Japanese is length sensitive, it took time to get the two moras of "-te-wa" compressed from "-chaa" to "-cha," and the earlier form still survives as an option.My guess is that the same thing happened with じゃ:では → じゃあ → じゃThat is to say, I guess that じゃあ is older than じゃ.  If that's right, I also guess that the combination じゃあない is older than じゃない, and since I usually hear the shorter form, I'm guessing that じゃあない might sound a bit old-fashioned.  I'm curious if this is correct, so I decided to ask here.Anyway, here are my guesses about じゃあない:Perhaps じゃあない sounds like an older way of talking than じゃない.Perhaps じゃあない sounds a bit closer to ではない (making it slightly less informal than じゃない)Perhaps じゃあない is a dialectal variation of じゃない.Perhaps the author just likes the sound of じゃあない, and there's no real difference.So tell me, is there any difference between the two  Or are they totally the same
Seems that I stuck with modifying a noun again, in the following sentence is it only「破壊し尽す」 modifying 「背徳の欲望」 or both verbs 「玩弄し、破壊し尽す」 浮世離れした幼い少女を思うさま玩弄し、破壊し尽す背徳の欲望が掻き立てられてやまない。Full sentences: http://s.vndb.org/sf/17/17217.jpg
A while back in high school my classes watched "My Boss My Hero," in which the main character says ほんや, it was translated as "What" (I think.) In any case, I've never heard anything stylistically similar, so I was wondering where it came from.
隣村まで足にのばす。隣村：the neighboring village足：foot/legのばす：aside from growing a beard... stretch, extend...The best I could think is that it's like a literary way of saying you're heading out (extending your foot) to the neighboring village I don't trust myself to not miss some special meaning or usage though, so does anyone else have some insight本当にありがとうございます！

This question brought to you by the existence of カレー味のラムネIn my head, the reading here is あじ。 But I know 七味唐辛子{しちみとうがらし}, so it seems like as a counter it's み。I'm almost 100% sure that カレーの味 would be "あじ", but what about カレー味
It is somewhat uncommon, but some words such as 気宇{きう} and the name 霧生{きりう} end with  イ列 + う.I thought the pronunciation might be different from a simple concatenation of the two vowels, since 言う{いう} is pronounced as ゆう, and because in the examples I gave it is somewhat easier on the toungue for me to change the trailing う to ゆ, resulting in either きゆ　or きゅ for 気宇.How should I be pronouncing these
I think being able to to specify who you are talking about and yourself is very crucial in a language so, how do they do itTo clarify I know in French there is 6 ways to specify a person:Je (I), tu (you (informal)), il/elle (he and she, respectively (can also mean it)), nous (we), vous (you guys/formal you), and ils/elles (the boys and the girls, respectively).And in French the verb To be is specific to the type of person:Je [suis] (I am), tu [es] (you are (informal)), il/elle [est] (he/she/it is), nous [sommes] (we are), vous [êtes] (you guys are/you are (formal)), and ils/elles sont (they are).So my question is, how would that be done in in Japanese keeping in mind both gendersFor example:How would you say:I am happy. (In French it would be: Je suis content(e if you were a girl).If Japanese is different, then what makes in different. What does it have that French/English don't and what is similar.

Can someone help me understand this 直打ち, as used in the following sentence:URLを直打ちしてアクセスされた可能性があります。(this is an error message in a log file)My dictionaries have no idea what this word means.As far as I can tell this means something like:"There's a possibility that there was a directly accessed URL"So 直打ち means "direct access", 直 as in 直接 (directly)and打 as in 打つ (hit)Also regarding the reading, i asked a couple of Japanese people and got told both:じかうち and ちょくうちany ideas which is correct in this context
In an informal conversation with a new friend, I was discussing 擬態語. She offered the word もやもや as an example, meaning "to be horny (i.e.., desiring sex)." After clarifying the meaning, I left it at that. When I looked it up I see this definition:もやもや  moyamoya   · モヤモヤadverb / noun or participle with aux. verb する → conjugation:  hazy;  murky;  misty;  foggy;  fuzzy;  —Onomatopoeia.「あっぱれ！」天使はそういうと、稲妻が走るもやもやの煙の中へ消えていった。 "Done!" says the angel, and disappears in a cloud of smoke and a bolt of lightning.adverb / noun / noun or participle with aux. verb する → conjugation:  gloomy;  feeling depressed;  feeling sad;  —Onomatopoeia.In any case, it is apparent that Tangorin.com is making a mistake in calling this word onomatopoeia, as it is a mimetic word instead (apparently a Phenomime.)Is it also a psychomime expressing the state of horniness or did I hear wrong If I heard wrong does such a psychomime existI would ask this friend directly, but I have a girlfriend and am wary of initating what could be a flirtatious conversation.*Edit: Kotobank has this definition so I think I heard right:色情がむらむらと起こるさま。「数々の通はせ文、清十郎も―となりて」〈浮・五人女・一〉Is this expression common and easily understandable Is the meaning different than むらむら
[一度]{いちど(ひとたび)} means once, but [一遍]{いっぺん} also mean once in sentences like once I did something or once I am a something. 常に means always in sentences like I always am a something or I always do somethingBut idiomatically, Once bitten twice shy is translated as [羹]{あつもの}に[懲]{こ}りて[膾]{なます}を[吹]{ふ}く in Japanese.So if I want to say Once a thief, always a thief, is this phrase grammatical 盗人一度, 常に盗人What if I want to say Once a X, always a X and X is a noun/noun phrase
Does it have a less literal meaning that "nothing left behind"
What are these in hiragana typing when I want to type wa
In this 4コマ漫画{まんが}, a four panel comic, a young attractive woman walks through a station ticket gate, but there's something wrong with her ticket. The station attendant calls after her, first by calling out お客{きゃく}さん！, which is "customer" or "passenger", a usual way for a staff to refer to a patron. She does not respond. So then he calls out おネエさん！, which is something like "miss" or "young lady". She still does not respond. He calls out おネエさま！, which is again "miss" or "young lady" or something like that, just with the politeness upped a little. She does not respond.Finally, he calls out お嬢{じょう}さま！. Which, as far as I've understood its usage, is still just a way of saying "young woman" or "daughter". My dictionary also says it means "unmarried woman".My feeling is that this comic isn't wildly hysterical in any case, but there's some kind of nuance to the fact that she only responds to お嬢{じょう}さま！ that is supposed to be kind of amusing. But to my non-native Japanese level of comprehension, it's just different ways of referring to a young woman, so I'm not seeing the extra connotations that support the humour.What is it about her responding only to お嬢{じょう}さま！ that is in any way noteworthy Is the fact that the man beside her is more distant from her in the last panel relevant (in that he is clearly not her husband)Lastly, I thought おネエさん！ would be too casual for a station attendant. Wouldn't it translate to something like "hey, babe"
At first I thought it was a typo, but inserting the character 煜 into birthday wishes or the like seems to be common, e.g.おめでとう煜ございます  おめでとうございます煜  おめでとう煜ございます煜I have several problems:What does it meanWWWJDIC has "bright, shining, brilliant", which sort of fits.How is it pronounced (if at all)The readings given in WWWJDIC are イク, オウ, かがや・く, although none of them look like a particularly meaningful interjection.How is it typedNone of the readings イク, オウ, かがや・く, produce the character in my IME (although I do get 燠, which has the readings イク, オウ, おき and あたたか・い).
In Chinese, usage of 四字熟語 a lot usually demonstrates sophistication and things like political announcements etc that want to sounds powerful and sophisticated use a big load of them. What does using them convey in Japanese They seem a lot less common. Are they considered "clichés" as English expressions such that "it is raining buckets" or "... is in hot water" Chinese seems peculiar for treating unoriginal clichés (used appropriately of course) as good style; did this carry over into Japanese
I'm transliterating my friend's names for fun and I'm having trouble figuring out the kana for the last name Curry. Would it be クリ？ Which doesn't seem right...It confuses me that this is also an actual Japanese dish. lol.Actually I'm also unsure about the last name Castañeda. I've done about a dozen names correctly by checking Google results and I would like some help with these two. :)
I would like some help understanding this sentence. あの真面目できちんとした性格の母さん（が動詞をする）I don't understand the した性格 part, because how can した modify "personality" which can't do anything I also don't understand the function of 真面目で, especially what the で particle means.If I had to give a translation, I would say: Given her real personality, my mother ....

I can't find a definition for this word アメテ. Aside from sounding like an amateur, the word didn't make sense in the context. In the context, a character was flipping out. The entire sentence he screamed was:アメテ!!Is this just a random sound he made or... whatThe sentence before ended with してるわけ!! if that helps.
I don't get these sentences; the first one ends with けど (plus I don't get why there is the use of ! at the end)Here the sentences:俺モデル!  顔命なの です  けど!んなに  硬くねーだろ&gt;I know that けど means "but, though, however" but I don't get the meaning here.My translation is:"I am a model! My face is the most important thing but!" (there's a pause here before the person continues talking)"It isn't so hard"But the second sentence kind of make no sense to me unless けど at the end changes the entire meaning of the second sentence So that the translation is completely differentThe context is (if this can help) the person has been hit by a ball in the face and he is angry and shouting.Help would be much appreciated (:
For example, if I want to say "(this food has) become not tasty", would the correct way to say that be "おいしくなくなりました" How would this be distinguished from おいしく亡くなりました, "died tastily", however meaningless that may be Is there some more idiomatic way to say the former, and can I expect ない to behave perfectly like a 形容詞
-ず and -ぬ are two alternatives to the negative form -ない / -ません. But I noticed that depending on the word, it's either -ず or -ぬ, although it seems like some words can take both suffixes. Some examples I have encountered:-ず知らず (lyric in song "touch" by Younha)わからず (lyric in song "aisuru mono" by Angela Aki)せず (song title: "yudan sezu ni ikou")なれず (lyric in song "mirae he" by Kiroro)-ぬ気づかぬ (lyric in song "arigatou" by Kokia)届かぬ (song title: "todokanu omoi")ならぬ (lyric in song "shunrai" by Yellow Generation)both -ず and -ぬとらず / とらぬできず / できぬSo are there rules for choosing between -ず and -ぬ
楽しみ is derived from  楽しむ isn't it Despite this, it's used as if it were an adjective, and I don't completely understand why it can be used in 楽しみにする.What is the name of the form that 楽しみ is relative to 楽しむ, and why can you use it in にする
I know that て can be used before いる, as well as when asking for ください, but I just realized I don't really know what it means. For instance, I just read an instance of て being used at the end of a sentence:"知り合いもいるからちょっと待ってて!"What exactly does the て form mean in this context I know it's short for いて, but even so, I've never ended a sentence with a て form verb.
Cheers,I'm teaching myself the language for a while now and I'm picking up on basic grammar structure. Combined with a dictionary, I can occasionally even make sense of a sentence!But the full meaning of this one eludes me (as well as Google Translate and Bing Translator). It's a review of a game I worked on:ゾンビを潰していくのは単純に楽しい。It doesn't seem to be an error, even to a beginner.From what I can tell, with help of Google Translate and OS X Japanese-English dictionary, the components seem to be:ゾンビ - zombieを - object marker潰して - 'te' form of crush (Google Translate), destroy (Bing Translator), fit for (!) (OS X dictionary)いく - to go; "going to"のは - I have no idea what this is; it seems to be composed of possessive "no" and as-for-# subject marker "wa"単純 - simplicityに - location marker (here, in)楽しい - enjoyableSo it seems to be a positive review; it seems to say "You will crush zombies [のは] (which is) enjoyable in simplicity." What does のは above mean What nuance am I missing
A: Be careful not to make a mistake.B: I know that without being told.A: 間違えないように気を付けてね。B: 言われなくても分かってるって。In the final って in B's answer, I am supposing that this is the "quotative って," used as a way to emphasize B's own voice. Is he metaphorically quoting himselfPerhaps the implication is:"Yeah, like I said, I know that without being told."Is this line of thinking correct Would someone explain this use of ってIs there a Japanese term for this って*Apologies in advance for my colorful usage of the word solipsistic. If you think of a better title feel free to change it.
This is a little bit of an encyclopedic question, but I would like to know what separates the four expressions in the title, i.e., what separates them when they are close to referring to the same thing.I am also interested in learning what would be a more modern/usable replacement for 常套句, since it seems to be a little antique for daily use.
Sometimes there are situations when you'd like to describe someone saying something, but what exactly he says is less important than the rest of sentence and it can be easily ignored. Or in case when someone is saying some long and tedious speech and in your sentence you're just using "bla-bla-bla" instead. What's the word Japanese would use in such casesOther situation is when part of sentence is missing. In most cases during lessons or exercises. (Or when you heard something all but one word missing and describing it to someone.) Teacher then uses some substitute word like "something-something" instead, just to keep the pace when reading. What's the word Japanese would use in such cases
What is the function of the first こと in the following sentence「労働のビッグバン」こと非正規雇用の規制緩和が次々に行われたのは９０年代、バブルが崩壊して以降のことである。Logically it seems it has a function similar to と.  If that is indeed what it does, does it have any other nuanceIf possible I would like to have a translation, or other examples of こと being used this way.This sentence appears in an article in 文藝春秋オピニオン２０１３年の論点.
Sorry, I've been on reddit...and found the eighth definition here:回す  まわす 1: to turn; to rotate; to gyrate;  2: to circulate; to send around;  3: to surround;  4: to put something to a new use (e.g. leftovers);   5: () (after the -masu stem of a verb) ... around (i.e. to chase someone around);  6: to dial (e.g. telephone number);   7: (Godan verb with su ending) to invest;  8: to gang-rapeIs this definition ever used Is it slang If it is not asking too much, would someone provide an example
I have found this example, using the human counter:In this movie, the two female ghosts who appear before the main character, a man who works as a potter, are both victims of a war-torn society.  この映画で、主人公の陶工の男の前に姿を現す二人の女の幽霊は、共に戦乱の世の犠牲者。However, I also see this as one definition for 位 :い  ( i )   【位】counter for ghosts*Interestingly enough, I found the Japanese term for the Trinity is 三位一体 (さんみいったい)If this counter is in fact used as a counter for ghosts, would someone be kind enough to demonstrate its usage
This sentence is from NHK newsweb easy.政府は、新型インフルエンザ（＝人から人にうつる今までになかった新しいインフルエンザ）が世界で流行して、日本でも大勢の人が亡くなる心配がある場合、どうするかというガイドライン（方針）の案を作りました。I'll remove the easier parts and try to reduce it to the part i'm having trouble parsing...政府は、インフルエンザが流行して、人が亡くなる心配がある場合、どうするかというガイドラインの案を作りました。I can't figure out how 流行して plays into the sentence. I have two main ideas...(1) インフルエンザが流行して is a high-level clause, and the rest of the sentence after して should be treated as a unit. The flu is spreading in reality.(2) インフルエンザが流行して、人が亡くなる心配がある場合 goes together; the spreading of the flu causes people to die/causes people to worry about people dying. The flu is not necessarily spreading in reality, it is just a hypothetical situation (場合).
Would it happen to be something roughly like "Even if I'm not busy"
I know the following words that all mean a road of some kind:道町街路道路街路街道通り通り道What's the difference between all these words I'd assume size would be one of them, but what is the order if this is true
I'm confused about リィ.  (That's big リ followed by little ィ.)Although this combination isn't part of the official orthography (as far as I know), it seems to be fairly common.  I asked a Japanese friend, and she said it's pronounced similar to like English -ry, but I'm afraid I don't trust my ear enough to hear exactly what she means by that.  I think I might do better with a more technical explanation.  My guess is that it's something like /rji/, but I'm having trouble pronouncing that.Here are my questions:How do I pronounce りぃ  Is it the same as a "normal" kana or pair of kana, like リ or リーIs りぃ one mora or two  I think one is plausible, like りゃ・りゅ・りょ, but I also think two is plausible, like よぉ or ねぇ.  (I hope I'm not wrong about these last two being two moras long!)I made a list of similar kana pairs, just in case it made more sense to answer generally about all of them.  (If it doesn't make sense, please ignore this list!) イィ・キィ・ギィ・シィ・ジィ・チィ・ニィ・ヒィ・ビィ・ピィ・ミィ・リィ
I would very much appreciate it if someone could tell me what 言やいー refers to. All I know is that 言 has something to do with speaking or words, but that alone doesn't help. Is it slangThe entire phrase I'm trying to decipher is: 食えないなら食えなんって言やいーのにSo far I only understand the parts about being unable to eat.
In the following sentence, how are にね and ご used in that first clause. I'm baffled. They seem to have no meaning.で、そんなご身分にね、一年も経てばいよいよ引け目を感じますよ。
I pretty much couldn't find this とこに in my dictionary so I was wondering what it means.Here's the context:あんなとこにタオル落ちてるAlso, is あんな a slang for あのなEdit. I forgot, my translation would be:"The towel has fallen"But yeah, I don't get the meaning of anna tokoni.
My question concerns the middle part of this sentence.宮さんは、僕がこうして敬称付きで呼ぶにも関わらず、  見た目十代前半くらいの少女なのだった。How exactly does こうして affect the meaning of the sentenceWhat part of the sentence is 関わらず talking about Regardless of the title Of an invitationIf 敬称付きで means something like "has the title of" then how is what comes after (呼ぶ) to be interpreted I assume it has to be either "invited" or "inviter." Can it be eitherThank you very much!
I hear ワンマン運転　as ワンマウンテン, with the ん　of マン dissapearing, or perhaps being very soft.Here's an example:http://youtu.be/DZnuH1XkE7st=49sAnother question shows that there can be something phonetically special about ん＋vowel words.  This suggests the 'u' sound might be nasalized, but I don't hear the 'u' sound being different from a normal う in this example.How do I pronounce ワンマン運転 Is this different from ワンマウンテン Is there a rule that applies to some other words  Or is it a special case like 雰囲気
In all the time I've studied the language, I've never heard or seen anybody even hint at whether the principles from a given language (like using “burnt toast” vs. “burning toast”) carry over, or if the language has its rules with how that works. Anyone know
I believe it has something to do with bullying.Also, I think I heard it as a verb: やさぐれるI can't seem to find much information about it. Is it slang
It's a topic of debate to what extent Japanese has sarcasm and irony. In any case, Japanese speakers seem to use a whole lot less of it than English speakers.My question is: whether or not Japanese speakers use it themselves, do they typically recognize what is—to Americans at least—very blatant verbal irony Or will they commonly assume the sarcastic party has gone suddenly insaneExampleA: どうしてサハラ砂漠になんて行きたいんですか？ハイキングでもしたいの？B: いや、泳ぎに行こうと思ってます。Would a super-fluent speaker be able to sell this kind of irony Would a なんてね at the end of sentence B make it work
In a visual novel a girl just said そうですねー and the guy replied「僕はですね、伯母の紹介だったからこそ、ここでバイトしてる訳ですが。」I feel like he's making fun of her for saying desu ne.... and that she sounds like his auntEdit. バイト means "work" in this context.
I've run across the expression/word a few times in manga, and generally the context indicates that it's a conjugation of する with the ～がる indication of "3rd party appearance of internal state" (as in 怖い -&gt; 怖がる). Is this generally correct If so, where the や comes from or is this just yet another 'special' conjugationAn example fragment I have here is:いつも, すました顔しやがって...(Context is a few moments before a love declaration... meaning is obvious enough)Another example comes from pg 12 of the first QED manga, where an enraged player who has just lost a video game competition yells:こっちの動き全部読んでますってな動きしやがってよ！！
In　桜桜 what do "いざや" and "見に行かん" mean, or rather why do they mean what they mean. I've never heard a term like いざや, and I've never seen 行く written as ゆく, nor have I seen an あん  ending unless it was going to be あない.
Just before these sentence main character told that he is worried about crossing the tunnel(because of some childhood memories). That is why I'm not sure what is he talking about in this sentence(bold one). About crossing the tunnel「通ってしまえば」 and it wasn't scary at all「どうということもなかった」, or he talking about 「心地」 from the sentence before     トンネルの出口の光が見える。それは瞬く間に、トンネルの闇を払い、僕のーー俺の意識を現実へと引き戻してくれた。電車がトンネルから抜け出すーー先頭から車内に陽の光が一気に差し込まれていく。それは視界の一瞬の変化でしかない。しかしトンネルの圧迫感が体に残っていて、体感的に徐々に変わっていくような心地だった。身構えてしまったが、通ってしまえば、どうということもなかった。Thank you very much for help!
There is a suggestively conversation between two men who are fighting each other. A is claimed to be strongest wizard and B is nearly strong as A. Here is the conversation,A: 世の中上には上がおるB: それはよく知ってる。だがたまには下も見るもんだぜ。そいつはすぐ[足下]{あしもと}にいるかもしれねえ。Here I get,A: In the world there is (always) upper of upper. (Which implies there is always someone who is stronger than you, OK I got it!!)B: I know that well. .......................... That guy might be just right under your feet.Does "だがたまには下も見るもんだぜ" mean "But sometimes there are ones who look down too" or "But sometimes they should look down too"  If I'm mistaken then what does it mean I'm confused about it, yoroshiku onegaishimasu~~
Why do the counting words use a possesive particle
I am unsure how to translate the following phrase:[散々]{さんざん}人{ひと}を待{ま}たせておいて最初{さいしょ}の一言{ひとこと}がそれかMy guess as to how this phrase translates is:Is that the first thing people say to those who are waiting for themIs there a better way to translate this phrase
The following dialogue is from the video game Final Fantasy VI:宿屋{やどや}の[親父]{おやじ}は、[余所者]{よそもの}が[嫌]{きら}いでね。I think I understand this sentence.  It means something like "the old man at the inn doesn't like outsiders".  But I'm not sure why it ends with でね (as opposed to, say, だよ).  I can tell that it's the -te form of the copula だ plus the particle ね, but I'm not sure exactly when this combination is used.  I couldn't find discussion of ending sentences with で in dictionaries, or any explanation of the combination でね.  So I decided to look for examples online.  I found these on ALC and in the Tanaka corpus:「それは私が知っているある海賊の名前でね。」  "It's the name of a buccaneer of my acquaintance"「ああ、ただの黙想でね」  "O, it's just a retreat, you know" 「いやぁ、昨日は入れ食いでねえ。」  "They were biting like crazy yesterday."   Based on these four examples, it seems like でね is used to present new information.  I feel like I'm missing some nuance or implication, though.  (I tried looking for similar combinations with other particles instead of ね, but I couldn't find any.)What exactly does でね mean in sentences like theseEDIT: After posting this, I found てね in 大辞林, but I don't think the meaning fits what I'm seeing here...  It says 「相手に対するやや甘えた依頼や希望を表す。てよ。」, but these sentences don't look like they express 依頼 or 希望.
Does Japanese slang use animal names to describe people's personalities in the same way English does  If so, what are some common onesFor example, in English, men can often be called "dogs" or "cats"; sometimes I hear "ape".All men are dogs!　→　can mean "disgusting", sexually selfish, etc.That guy's a real cool cat.　→　a (smooth) guy; relaxedWhat a bunch of apes!　→　Large, slow, possibly bumbling, rough, rude (野暮)There are several common terms for women too: "birds" (usually British English only), "minx", "dogs", "foxes"/"foxy".Do you fancy that bird　→　a fine (young) womanYou wily minx!　→　a sly girl; possibly very flirtatiousOK, so my girlfriend's a dog.　→　an ugly womanWhat a total fox!　→　attrictive, beautiful, sexy (which is ironic since foxes and dogs are closely related)Does Japanese slang describe people with certain animals  The only one that comes to mind is 豚児, but that seems like antiquated "peasant" 謙譲語 more than slang.  If they don't use animals, is there some other "system" that is used
In the following phrase:「時{とき}が過{す}ぎても彼{かれ}のままだった。」what does the「彼{かれ}のままだった」part meanMy guess is that I can translate this phrase into something like "He's the same" or "he didn't change", but I'm not sure.

I heard the expression ネコでも分かる... mentioned in a TV drama as title for a (fictional) book, in the sense of "...for dummies". A quick search on Amazon brings up a few (real) titles ネコでも分かる... or サルでも分かる...Is this an idiomatic expression you can use in day-to-day speech, or is this just restricted to these lines of books by particular publishers If this is a normal speech pattern, are there any other animals commonly employed in this context
Is it legal for parents to give to their child a first name with latin letters (romaji, I guess), instead of using katakana, hiragana, or kanjiFor example, if Japanese parents want to give their children the English name John, can they avoid using katakana and just use the original latin letters  Is this legal or not
I'm still playing Final Fantasy VI, and I came across this bit of dialogue:マリアの頭にオモリ  落としたるけんね。I understand it up to 落とし.  Orthros is going to drop the weight on her head!  I can't make heads or tails of たるけんね, though.  I assume it's some kind of dialect.My best guess is 落としたるけんね ← 落としてやるからね.  Specifically, I think it might involve these two changes:たる ← てやるけん ← から.Does that seem right
This is the question I was trying to ask when I made this question, but I guess I can't type or read or think. I'm looking for the difference between 逃げる and 逃れる. I'm assuming it's something like the difference between "run away" and "escape", but which one is which And I'm aware that even "run away" and "escape" are pretty close even in English, but these things happen.
It's pretty straightforward, I'm wondering what the nuance between 逃げる and 逃す isI'm assuming it's something like the difference between "run away" and "escape", but which one is which
I'm playing a video game (Final Fantasy VI), in which a character is reading her lines and stage directions for a play.  The stage directions contain the following sentence:この芝居を間奏の間にこなしてちょ。I don't understand こなしてちょ.   I think it's the verb こなす inflected to こなし plus て, and then ちょ added to that, but I don't know what ちょ is.  I think this is some sort of command form. My question: what is ちょHere are my guesses:こなしてちょ　←　こなしててよ　←　こなしていてよこなしてちょ　←　こなしてちょうだいI think the first is plausible because it's similar to ちゃ ← ては, and I think the second is plausible because it's similar to the な command form shortened from なさい.  However, I can't tell if either of my guesses is correct.  (I have a feeling I'm likely to be wrong...)Sometimes 大辞林 lists colloquial contractions, so I decided to look it up.  There is one entry for ちょ, but it doesn't seem like the right answer.  It says it attaches to nouns and the roots of adjectives, and this doesn't seem like either of those.  (But maybe て can be considered a noun...)
My (poor) understanding of things is that there are two ways to get habitual semantics in Japanese:use the dictionary form of the verb:毎日、映画{えいが}を見に行く "I go to the movies every day."use the -teiru form of the verb:毎日、映画を見に行っている "I go to the movies every day."Do both the dictionary form and -teiru form allow a habitual reading for all verbs, or do certain types of verbs not allow one or the other Also, when both ways are available, how do you pick between the two -- is there any difference between the two
While studying Japanese through Rosetta Stone, I've run across these two sentences:私は仕事に行きます。私は仕事場にいます。I'm confused as to why the first sentence doesn't use "仕事場" since the person is going to the workplace.

How would you translate the following sentences1/ Check the identity of any other person for whom you may have requested an extra card.2/ She is the person to whom I sent the documents.I always struggle when I have to translate "for whom" or "to whom".On the web, I found "添付ファイルを送る相手" to translate "person to whom one sends the attachment".Is this translation acceptable  If I am correct, this may also mean "the person (or party) who sends the attachment". So I am really confused.Thank you very much for your help.
In ALC, I found the following example sentence:支払可能な額を払うpay what you canIt's the first time I see the word 額【ひたい】 used in this way and I wonder if this is just a case of mistranslation or if there is such an idiom (and what its usage would be).
I found this usage of じゃない. Perhaps the translation is too loose in meaning.A: Is your girlfriend cuteB: Why wouldn't she beA: 君の彼女、かわいい？B: かわいいに決まってるじゃない。Does "かわいいに決まってるじゃない" mean the same thing as "かわいいに決まってる," just with more emphasisIs the following reasoning therefore correctいいね。→いいじゃない。→いいじゃん（Tokyo dialect）。きれいね。→きれいじゃない。→きれいじゃん（Tokyo dialect）。大きいね。→大きいじゃない。→大きいじゃん（Tokyo dialect）。Or is there a different nuance by using the negative formFurthermore, I suppose inferring the speaker's intentions come from context and the lilt in the speaker's voice, as in the following:大きいね。Wow, it's big.大きいじゃない。 It's big, isn't it.大きいじゃん。 Damn, it's big.Though without context, " 大きいじゃない。" simply means, "It's not big."Correct*Bonus question:In English, if my translation is correct, the sentence,大きいじゃない。It's big, isn't itshould have a question mark. However, in Japanese, is it not required
In What differences should I look out for between male vs female speech, a lot of answers explicitly mention that ending question sentences with の is feminine. However, this makes very little sense to me, as my understanding is that の is pretty much the go-to particle for forming questions with non-polite speech.In general, か sounds pretty marginal to me with non-polite speech:(1) ｘ何をしてるか？  (2) ｘ学校に行くか？Sometimes, のか works:(3) ｘ何をしてるのか？  (4) ○学校に行くのか？(I think のか only fails when you have a 'question word' like 何, どこ, だれ, etc.; it seems to make it sound rhetorical, e.g., 「彼女は何をしてるのか、僕は分からない。」)And of course の always works:(5) ○何をしてるの？  (6) ○学校に行くの？And as far as I can tell, simply using intonation (or a question mark to represent it) works all the time:(7) ○何をしてる？  (8) ○学校に行く？First off, my judgements here might be wrong since they are just my own.But, if they are correct, my question is: if ending your sentence with の really is feminine, what is the alternative to (5) in usual male non-polite speech Is (7) the only option

I know しない as the ない形 of するas in 市内 (within the city)as in 竹刀 (bamboo sword)but none of these three seem to make sense, and the first one isn't even a 名詞.Could someone please explain しない in this context and the general pattern of how/when to use itThanks!
I'm looking for pointers on which readings (on/kun) were changed in the 2010 reform. By that I mean which kanji has additional readings and which kanji has had one or more readings removed Is there a document that summarizes these changes
Why are there so many terms for royalty  And I'm talking about generic words like "king", "queen", etc.  I seem to remember from my studies that certain terminology was used specifically for Japanese royalty, and other terms were used for foreign royalty of the same status/rank.  I also seem to remember hearing that certain terms were related to religion/Buddhism, while others weren't.From what I understand about "kings" and "emperors", historically there used to be a great distinction: kings ruled kingdoms, which were smaller territories inside of an empire, all of which was (obviously) ruled by the emperor.  However, in the present day, I don't think there is such a distinction to most people, as governments have changed greatly over the ages.  So the nuances between the terms for "king" and "emperor" (likewise, with "queen" and "empress") seem to overlap a lot.Here are many of the terms I've used/seen/found for common royaltyKing - [王(様)]{おう(さま)}、[国王]{こく・おう}、[君主]{くん・しゅ}、[大王]{だい・おう} 、[大君]{たい・くん} Emperor - [帝]{みかど}、[皇帝]{こう・てい}、[帝王]{てい・おう}、[大帝]{たい・てい} 、[天子]{てん・し}（様）、[天皇]{てん・のう}、[天王]{てん・のう}Queen - [女王]{じょ・おう}、[王妃]{おう・ひ}？、[女帝]{じょ・てい}？Empress - [皇后]{こう・ごう}、[皇太后]{こう・たい・ごう}、[太皇太后]{たい・こう・たい・ごう}、[后]{きさき}、[妃]{きさき}、[王妃]{おう・ひ}、[女帝]{じょ・てい}Prince - [王子]{おう・じ}、[皇子]{おう・じ}、[皇太子]{こう・たい・し}、[親王]{しん・のう}Princess - [王女]{おう・じょ}、[皇女]{おう・じょ}、[妃]{ひ} 、[王妃]{おう・ひ}、[親王妃]{しん・のう・ひ}、[内親王]{ない・しん・のう}、[王子妃]{おう・じ・ひ}、[皇太子妃]{こう・たい・し・ひ}、[妃殿下]{ひ・でん・か}、[大君女]{おお・きみ・おんな}、（お）[姫]{ひめ}（様）、[姫御子]{ひめ・み・こ} Then there are the suffixes [陛下]{へい・か} (Majesty) and [殿下]{でん・か} (Highness)...that you can add to certain ones, but not to all apparently.QuestionsWhy are there so many terms for these generic wordsIf my assumptions from above are correct, which ones are for Japanese royalty and which ones are for foreign royalty" " " ", which ones are religious terms and which are "regular"What are the rules for being able to apply 陛下 or 殿下Can someone clear up this mess
I can say that after much research on this, I'm more thoroughly confused than before I started.  I'm talking mostly about when they are used as suffixes, but the concept applies when they stand alone, or even start some words.At first it seemed like 心 is used more to describe the core/root nature of something, and the other two are more for momentary/temporary states of mind.  But I've found so many examples where the definitions appear to overlap that I'm just not sure any more.  One dictionary definition I found comparing 意 and 念 indicates that 意 is a more temporary, outward appearance, while 念 is something deeper.「意」が表面的、一時的な心の動きも含むのに対して、「念」はもっと深く心に思う気持ち。But again, there are many examples that I can find where I'm not sure of the nuances between them.疑心・疑念・But no 疑意信心・信念・But no 信意念願・心願・But no 意願　→　念願 is like a "neutral" desire/wish, whereas 心願 conveys a religious desire/wish/prayer感謝の念・感謝の心・謝意専心・専念・専意　→　All seem to mean the same悪心（あくしん）・悪念・悪意　→　First two similar (intent to do something bad), last is different (malice, ill will (toward someone))心のまま・意のまま・念のまま？QuestionsWhat are the nuances between these threeAre there any hard rules on when you can use them or not use them (Like examples above - why isn't 疑意 acceptable)
I am currently reading a manga for studying Japanese and encountered something strange. A girl exclaims「な゛!」The situation is that she has just had water squirted up her nose, so I am guessing it's a kind of 'gnya' sound So my question is, is this a real Japanese language thing, or is it just the artist taking liberties with the language for comic effectCheers

Closed 7 years ago.Many people say that gendered language is especially important in Japanese. To a point, I can understand this, but only to a certain distance. For example, if I (Fe/male) were to say 'Wow, that show was impressive!', in a neutral pitch, it wouldn't sound queer if I were male of female. However, if I were to say 'Ooh, that show was fantastic!' (generally female sounding), or 'Damn, that show was fucking awesome, man.' (generally male sounding), it wouldn't be wrong, but to some it would sound quite strange.I can understand this in Japanese too, but some stress it to a point I can't believe. For instance, for the most part, things in Japanese seen as 'masculine' (most common examples I've heard), are: 僕、俺、だ（copula）、か（interrogative）; and ones seen as 'feminine' are: 私、あたし、です、〜ます、の （interrogative）、わ. Now, keep in mind, 私、です、〜ます、only apply in casual conversations and situations, and in polite ones, it is 'correct', and wouldn't be 'feminine'. Similarly, の  as an interrogative, I hear isn't feminine in some situations as well, and わ is sometimes used by males, and in some dialects, it's not feminine at all. (correct me if I'm wrong).Also, things seen as masculine, I hear females saying all the time, and at no sacrifice to their femininity. Although I have yet to hear a woman say 俺, there has been no shortage to the amount of women saying 僕、だ、か. Although more women are using 'masculine' language than men using 'feminine' language, it is still there.I have heard that if you don't use the appropriate set, people will be confused, maybe upset. If you mix them, you may be seen as gender non-conforming. Is this really true Just how important is gendered language in Japanese

It seems easy but I can't figure out the uses of はじめて= Hajimete and どれだっけ= doredakkeThis is the sentence:はじめて  食った具だ  どれだっけHajimete kutta gu da doredakkeI know that Hajimete can be adverb and means "first time", and I know it is a intransitive verb as well.However my translation is:"What was the first time I ate such ingredients again" But I don't know if this translation is right because as I said I don't really get the use of hajimete and doredakke in this case.Could anyone help with a proper translation and explanation please
From my understanding, "で" have many different usages in Japanese. I have some questions regarding the following particular uses of で. It would be very helpful if someone could also come up with other sentence examples related to my questions. Thank you.1) 皆で写真を撮ります。What is the meaning of で here Does it sort of indicate "状態" to mean taking a picture of everyone "as a group" I'd appreciate if someone could also come up with another sentence or two where で also served as the same purpose as we have in this example.If for example, there are a total of 9 people in the group and it was decided that we will take a total of three pictures with 3 different people in each picture. In this case, can one say 三人で写真を撮ります？ If it is incorrect, what are more appropriate ways to say this2) In general, we hear people say "二人で", is the usage of で here the same as で in the previous question(i.e.皆で写真を撮ります)3) Upon entering restaurant, when waiter asks how many people in the group, can one say "二人で" if there are two people Is this で usage the same as in my previous two questions4) I learned that で is also used when specifying a choice from a limited number of selections such as when we buy clothes, we can say 大で to specify size "large".My question is, I remember hearing people say "こっち”で when they tell the salesperson of a particular item they want to buy. Why do they also use で here Is the usage of で here indicating "こっち” is the particular item chosen to buy "from the entire selections of clothes in the store"
I found this YouTube comment:きゃりーぱみゅぱみゅとっても可愛い〜(*ﾉ∀ﾉ)ダンスとか覚­えてみたいと思いまーすww﻿I'm not sure how to parse 覚­えてみたい. The context seems to make it have nothing to do with 覚る, and in any case the え 送り仮名 doesn't make a bit of sense with さとる.  Is this a typo or some word not in my dictionary
Mostly I've seen 掃除 "souji" for "cleaning".  Here recently I noticed an anime had a floor-sign for "closed for cleaning" using 清掃 "seisou".  What's the differenceLooking at the kanji didn't help any.  Internet searches found uses of them near each other but no explanations (in English).
What's the difference between 事由 "jiyuu" and 理由 "riyuu"  Both are translated to mean "reason", as in why something happened.I even noticed in Tae Kim's Grammar Guide that both words are listed, and both are translated "reason", but no distinction is made between them.
This is actually following a recently asked question on how to say "for." I thought that saying あなたに私の愛 sounded perfectly fine - "toward you, my love."However another user changed it to あなたに対する愛, or あなたへの私の愛.My two problems are: Why is あなたに私の愛 wrong When can I write への and can I equivalently write にの
I have met the parents of a close Japanese friend two times in my life and have never been sure how I should address them. Both times I've asked the friend beforehand but never got a satisfactory answer.One friend said I could just call her parents お母さん・お父さん; the other friend said that her parents would find it rudely over-familiar if I were to call them that.Both times I suggested last-name+さん but both friends felt this would be weird/confusing as there would be many people with the same last-name present.I feel first-name+さん or あなた would sound rude...So the question is: How should you address a friend's parents when meeting them for the first timeThank you!
I will use a specific example.I was trying to write "My love for you is hurting me.""私の愛ために貴方は私を傷つけている。" Is what I came up with, however, I am unsure about the usage of "ために" in this situation.And if it is incorrect, what would be the correct way to say "for"
This is a two part question.1.) When spelling out a word in kana, what is the correct way to call the small つ (for example the small っ in ちっちゃい)I only have experience with my Japanese friends using the informal sounding小さい『つ』orちっちゃい『つ』Is there a formal grammatical term for this "character"2.) If there is, but in reality it sounds too academic, which term would be the most immediately understandable in an informal setting
Is there a way of typing Japanese characters when you have no knowledge of the language I've cut and pasted from Japanese websites before and used translation websites from English to Japanese with no trouble. I'm just wondering how I can search for what the text is from a t-shirt I have.I've had this t-shirt for a while now and wear it a fair bit. I'm just wondering what I'm saying to people who can read it as I go about my business. If you can answer my above question or simply translate it for me that would be great - I understand it may mean I'll never wear it again, however!
I really really need help with this sentence I have tried everything but I don't get its structure and how to translate it so I'd appreciate if someone could help pleaseオレ一人 ore hitori  チャラチャラしても charachara shitemo  浮くっつーか uku ttsuuka  恥ずかしい hazukashii  Someone told me that 浮くっつーか--&gt; つーか is very colloquial, the original is "というか" = "と言えるかもしれない" means "perhaps I should say".but it still doesn't make sense to me.My rough translation is:"Even if I am the only one who is talkative that would be inappropriate and embarrassing"Total fail and bad English translation I know. Also it really doesn't fit with the context. Please can someone help
This morning my co-worker asked me if I wanted some coffee.  I said, "No thanks, I can't drink coffee because it upsets my stomach."  I was thinking of how I'd say this in Japanese, but I'm not sure which is the most appropriate way to say "can't" in this situation.It seems like saying 飲めない or 飲むことができない would only be correct if I physically couldn't get the coffee down my throat.  Since that's not the case and I'm using "can't" to really mean "I won't because of the undesirable after effects", those two seem wrong.Is either of コーヒーを・は飲み得ない, 飲むわけにはいかない more correct and/or preferrable  Or would something without potential, like 飲みにくい・づらい・がたい work betterUpdate:  I knew I was forgetting an option when I wrote this topic.  I left out the possibility of 飲みかねる, but that sounds really wrong to me.
I'm having trouble understanding why 〜に受かる means "to pass". What would the equivalent logic in English be for this phrase (Something like the intransitive form of receive)Also, why is the particle に used with 受かる, here
I've been learning about these for awhile, but everything I've seen them used in doesn't use more than 1 at a time. Is there a reason for thatAlso my materials don't really explain the subtleties behind using 込む(to do something in an upfront way, i.e.聞き込む) and 回る(to go around doing something, i.e. 歩き回る) as 助動詞. Is there anything more I should know
I was emailing a friend and used the phrase "タイピングすることの早さ" which I discovered was very incorrect.  I did some searching on Google and here is what I discovered:タイピングの速度　&lt;-rareタイピング速度 &lt;-commonタイピング速さ　&lt;-not foundタイピングの速さ　&lt;-commonI'm curious as to what the differences between 速さ, 早さ,　and 速度　are.  Also, why is の used more commonly with 速さ and not 速度
I recently got an automated email from Twitter with the following subject (except with real user names):username さん、username さん、username さんをご存じですかMy question is about を paired with ご存じですか.  As I understand it, を normally marks the direct object of a verb.  Therefore, I expect it to be followed by a transitive verb; if there is no verb, I expect one to be implied.  However, this sentence ends with a noun and copula instead, so I can't make grammatical sense of it.I assume this phrase is grammatical, as I got it in an email that was likely to be proofread, and I can find plenty of uses online on websites that I think are likely to contain standard Japanese.  So how does it work grammatically  The only explanation I can come up with is that ご存じです is functioning as a transitive verb, like a polite/honorific form of 存じる.  Is there a better explanation
Can somebody please explain what "beta" means in the following sentence:Tsugi no mokutekichi wa beta da keredo, Shikago.
Why do we always use で in the following situations 日本で一番寒い月は二月です。 日本で一番高い山は富士山です。 Why can`t we use use に here There is no action in these sentences yet we use で,rather we are indicating the place of existence.
A) Let's take just transitive verbs first:食べる人食べられる人B) Now let's take intransitive verbs:起きる人起きられる人起こす人起こされる人OK, this thing has confused me for a very long time now, like really long. Thus I am posting this here. I have asked the question once before but did not get a real answer.What I am confused with about verb+noun sentence is how it is to be translated. e.g from A) we get "The person that eats (person is subject, object omitted)" and "The person that is eaten (person is object here, subject omitted)" right Now let's get to B) I think all 4 sentences are grammatically valid and sound as far as usage is concerned. I would translate them as "The person that wakes up (person is subject and object - instransitive verb)" "The person that is awaken (by himself) (person is subject and object - intransitive)" or in other words "The person that awakes himself (by himself)"Then we have,"The person that wakes (others) up (subject is person, object omitted)""The person that is awaken (by someone else) (subject omitted, object is person)"Now what I want you folks to do is to make sure that I interpreted the Japanese sentences correctly. This will make sure that I understand how to make verb+noun sentences.Thus 食べる食事 means "The food that eats (someone/something)". To refer to the food I eat I shall say 食べられる食事は… "the food I eat is..." right
Is there any etymological relationship between the -さん suffix in 富士山 or 月山 and the -さん suffix you put at the end of a person's name Or are they unrelated
You can say for exampleぜひパーティーにいらしてねそのうちまた是非お出かけください「今晩お伺いしてもいいですか」「ぜひどうぞ」and きっと来てくださいねきっと訪ねて来てくださいI would translate both ぜひ and きっと in these sentences with "by all means", but I'm sure (as always), there's a nuance in meaning when you use either. Could someone please explain this nuance Thanks!
My textbook contains the following dialog where 鈴木さん interviews her 課長 about what he did last evening:鈴木「焼き鳥屋ですか。その店、いかがでしたか。」  課長「安くて、おいしかったよ。あんなにおいしい焼き鳥を食べたのは初めてだなあ。」  鈴木「そんなにおいしかったんですか。」  My previous understanding of こそあど was thatこ refers to something closer to the speaker than the listener,そ refers to something closer to the listener than the speaker, andあ refers to something equally distant to both the speaker and the listener.From this, I would think that the tastiness of the 焼き鳥 is much closer to the 部長 (he was there and had them, 鈴木さん was not), and, therefore that he would use こんなにおいしい, but my textbook says (but doesn't explain why) to use あんなに when talking about one's memories of a past experience.To put it differently, I thought that あんなにおいしい would be appropriate if both 鈴木さん and her 部長 had been at the 焼き鳥屋 together. I interpret 鈴木さん's response, そんなにおいしかった, in the same way, that the experience is closer to the 部長 because she wasn't there.Could someone explain the point I'm missing Thank you.
I have developed a word game quite similar to Scrabble, and I am currently considering adding a Japanese word list to it.Please note that I have no real knowledge of the language, apart from knowing the different alphabet types.While Hiragana or Katakana are not really suited to the games mechanics, I believe using a romaji word list is the best option.Now, I am wondering which romanization system I should use (knowing that my primary target would be native Japanese):Kunrei-shiki, which is the official systemHepburn, which is the most widely used (but apparently mostly by foreign speakers)At first sight, I cannot see any difference between the two systems in terms of ease to form words with a small set of letters (7) (I may be wrong though). So I think the best option would be to use the system in which native Japanese are most comfortable with.Which system would that beAnd secondarily, do you believe that a word game in romaji actually has potential (i.e. would it be interesting to play, as it is in English).
As I learned, we can use もらう like this 「私は彼女に弁当を作ってもらいました。」, where noun before に(から) - giver and は(etc.) - reciever. But I saw sentence like「もっとも・・・・・・そんな風になっちまった以上は、因縁なんざ意味がないだろう。悪いが俺に譲ってもらうぜ」   and the second one -   　Where noun before に is not giver(though in second case it's には, so I'm not sure), but as far as I can tell - receiver. Can somebody please explain this part to me, thank you very much for help!
A radical is the portion of a kanji that is used to list that kanji in a kanji dictionary. It could represent the "general" meaning (whatever that is), it could represent the sound, or it could represent other things that I don't know.I don't think we can know what the radical is for a new kanji just by looking at it.  Although I learned many kanji, I didn't find any pattern whatsoever in what the radical for a kanji has to be.All this confusion is making me ask this: where does the concept of kanji radical come from to begin with And more importantly, why isn't there a single definition for it The reason I am asking this is because while I can see that radicals are NOT the simplest building blocks of all kanji (which is what I thought before), they are still somehow supposed to help us break down the kanji for study and looking up in dictionary. How exactly are they helpful at all with all the chaos in Japanese
I have the following sentence I need to translate for my introductory Japanese class.私の友達の名前は、安田味子さんといいます。There are 2 parts I am having trouble with. First, the name translation. I think it should be something like Mr/Ms Yasuda Ajiko. When I type "Yasuda" in hiragana, my computer translates it to the correct kanji. However, the "Ajiko" doesn't get the right kanji, making me think that it is not the correct translation. The second issue is the sentence as a whole. I know the first part is "the name of my friend". And then the second part I think is "say it is Yasuda Ajiko". But these 2 parts of the sentence don't really go together into a good English sentance. "I say the name of my friend is Yasuda Ajiko" Any help is appreciated.
Can 、 join two complete sentences  In other words, can 、 replace 。  I thought it could, but in this answer, user1205935 seems to suggest that it cannot.  (Rather than ask about it in a comment, I decided to make a separate question about it.)Here are a pair of examples:Aと言う。Bと言う。Aと言う、Bと言う。Is example 2 ungrammatical
A native speaker of Japanese has asked if ゴールデンウィーク is wasei eigo.The Wikipedia article on Golden Week in Japan claims that the term was created in 1951.However, a google ngram search for English indicates that the combination "golden week" (and possibly "Golden Week") gets some hits before 1951.I was also confused by the fact that China also has a Golden Week, but that seems to have been created fairly recently.Is the term ゴールデンウィーク wasei eigo
How would one combine two or more quotes togetherIn English we just do something like "He said 'Quote A', 'Quote B' and 'Quote C'".In chat, snailboat gave these possibilities:「Quote A」「Quote B」って言う「Quote A」って、「Quote B」って言う「Quote A」って（言う）、「Quote B」って言う「Quote A」「Quote B」と言う「Quote A」と「Quote B」と言うAre these all valid
I was watching an old Saturday Night Live sketch from the 1970s, called Night of the Moonies, making fun of the Unification Church by putting them in the context of the movie Night of the Living Dead.The video I was watching happened to have Japanese subtitles. I noticed that in the subtitles, when they referred to the Unification Church, which is called 統一{とういつ}教会{きょうかい} in Japanese, they replaced 一 with ◯, so it looks like 統◯教会.My understanding of the use of ◯ is that it is the equivalent of when in English words are blacked out, to censor them so as not to offend. But I'm a little baffled by this instance of censorship, or even if that's what it is. [統〇]{とういつ}協会{きょうかい}が私{あたし}の家族{かぞく}親{おや}は嫌{きら}い"The Unification Church is my family. I don't like my parents."Why censor the name of the church Why block out only one of the kanji
Could anyone explain to me the difference between these 3 words, especially between 範囲 and 領域　？For example, I have these 練習問題:a.分野 　b.領域 c.範囲①　試験の……… は、17課までです。　②　外の大学との交流が進んで研究の………　が広がった。③　この賞はスポーツの………で活躍した人に与えられる。the right answers are :c. , a. , b. Does 範囲 carry the meaning of "covering a certain(/established) range(/area)", or somethingThen I have this sentence, where 範囲 and 領域 seem interchangeable:彼の知識の範囲（・ 領域）はとても広い。(His range of knowledge is very wide.)Thank you :)
One of the kanji we recently learned in class was 着. We learned it could be used for to wear [着]{き}る, to arrive [着]{つ}く, and as either a "classifier for arrival" or a "counter for jacket". In our homework, we have the following 2:[六]{ろく}[時]{じ}[着]{ちゃく}[六]{ろく}[着]{ちゃく}I am not sure how the classifier and counter work. This is what I think they mean:6 o'clock arrival (like as in an appointment)6th arrival (as in the 6th person to arrive) or 6 jacketsIs this the correct way to use the kanji
I'm confused about how to describe 相手 here. I don't know if it's “partner who can show their true self” or “partner to whom can show your true self”. Also, is the ぶつけられる here like ぶつけることができる 「素直な自分をぶつけられる相手を、さなや自分が出来るなら、喜んでしてあげたかった」Here's a screenshot for more context.
The following two sentences are from 日本語文法ハンドブック, page 116:移動を表す表現にはいくつかありますが、「行く」と「来る」は補助動詞としての用法を持つ点で文法的に重要です。補助動詞としての「〜ていく」と「〜てくる」（この場合は普通ひらがなで書きます）には、話し手など文中の特定の人物の視点を基準にした空間的な移動の方向性を示す用法と、特定  の時点からの出来事の時間的推移や展開のとらえ方を表す用法があります。My question is about など.  From context, it seems like the phrase 話し手など is modifying the following phrase, 文中の特定の人物の視点. I'm a little confused, though. A Dictionary of Basic Japanese Grammar (p.268) states that "[a] particle normally follows nado", so when I read this sentence, I was expecting some kind of particle after など to indicate the role played by 話し手など.  Instead, など was followed by a noun phrase!  As a result, I don't know what role 話し手など plays in the sentence.How can I understand など followed by a noun phraseMy guesses:N1などN2 = "N2 such as N1"There is some sort of particle deleted after など
Can someone explain to me the difference between the following forms思った思ってた思っていた
I've heard many people pronounce す, つ, く, and る as if く and る rhyme, す and つ rhyme, but not any other pair. It seems as if す is sometimes pronounced [sɨ] and く is pronounced [ku]. This doesn't seem to make sense though, since in many song lyrics they do rhyme and are used for rhyming effect.Is this related to the fact that す and つ are often devoiced and the devoiced /u/ sounds like [ɨ] Or is this related to the fact that my Chinese-accustomed ears mislead me when the う line is devoiced This is especially since it seems like people who pronounce the vowels of す and く the farthest are speakers with a Chinese accent, like the singer Alan Dawa Dolma. I swear though that for some speakers of Japanese I hear, す does not seem to rhyme with く.
The expression ~なければ ならない if I learned correctly means "must not not do ..." as in:日本語を勉強しなければなりません。You must not not learn Japanese. (i.e. you need to learn Japanese)However, taken on face value it doesn't really make sense. しなければなりません translates into "if (you) don't do, doesn't become (what)". The confusing part is that a direct translation into modern colloquial Chinese makes sense: 你不学日语的话，不成 = "If you don't learn Japanese, not become" = "You must learn Japanese".This seems like a Japanese borrowing from a common Chinese phrase; 不...的话 acts like ～なければ, and of course なる is sometimes written 成る. However, the expression does not exist in Classical Chinese, which I presume Japanese borrowed the most (including all the un-Mandarin-y readings). Classical Chinese would use 不可～. I'm suspecting this might be a Chinese loan from Japanese, just like how 不不不不 is a syntactical English loan of "no no no no" and not really parseable (Chinese has no word for "no", only 不 = not = ～ない). Putting something like "must not" in a verb at the end is very un-Chinesey. Modern Mandarin-based Standard Chinese has also borrowed lots of 和製漢語 such as 民主, 共和国, 歌姫, 写真, カラオケ, and pretty much all the vocabulary related to biology and political science, curiously.So when did this expression start in Japanese Does any equivalent to ~なければ ならない exist in, say, Classical Japanese or Old Japanese If so, it'd probably be the Chinese borrowing from Japanese, not the other way around.
I haven't heard from a good friend for a while, I would like to reproach him playfully, but have no clue what the appropriate thing to say would be.Would 恥を知れ! be appropriate if said in a funny tone, or is it too strong of an expression Edit: some contextForgive me if I didn't add too much context, but I wanted a generic advice more than a specific one. Though I understand in language, and especially in such a language as Japanese is, it doesn't make much sense to be context-free.Basically, we are very good friends, both males. We travelled a lot together while in Europe; I stayed at his place in Japan, he stayed at my place; met my family. We have a very strong connection and we are playful with eachother.We are, however, admittetly both 筆無精. And we don't keep in touch. The reason why I wanted something more than 久しぶり is because he got married and just did an announcement on Facebook. I want to do this playful scolding, but I don't want to sound too serious: of course I really care about his life, but I understand things have been hectic and he didn't have time to contact me.
What does ヘニャッ mean in the following sentenceやっぱり甘えたいと思う時あいますよね。疲れている時とか、ヘニャッってなりたくなる 時。
In the following sentence is it correct to put the second を here それをクラスメイトを見られて以降Maybe it should be に And if it's correct, how can we translate this partHere's the paragraph where the line is taken from中学の夏休みだったーー。 旅行から帰って来たゆきを迎えに、駅前のバスターミナルで大きな車が待っていたそうだ。  それをクラスメイトを見られて以降、彼女は人の目をひく場所で、車に乗ることを嫌がるようになった。
How do you form relative clauses that involves first person action For example : "There aren't people I can talk to". Basically my doubt is about all those questions that require a particle like "to", "ni" and the like, when you can't use V-te ageru/kureru/morau to explicitate who's doing what to whom..Don't know if it's clear &gt;.&lt;
Intuitively, I would guess it's 「いってんさ」, but I could image 「いちてんさ」just as well. For bonus points: is there any reference or dictionary that explains the pronunciation of numbers with counters (beyond the obvious ones taught in beginner's courses)
I've just started to learn Japanese, and I've been looking at the jōyō kanji. Most of the words have on reading and kun reading. I was wondering, which one is most popular and when should I use one over the other
Spanish is my mother tongue and I almost can't differentiate じょ and よ sounds.Maybe the same thing happens to English native speakers. How do you solve that problem in English... is there a common English word that uses the sound じょ and another that uses the sound よ
First of all, hi everyone.In the beginning of an anime episode I often see a message to turn on the lights in the room and not to sit too close to the screen. Leaving some stuff out it looks like this:テレビアニメを見る時は、近づきすぎないようにして見てくださいね。Note the bolded parts. I have 2 questions.I looked up づき in the dictionary, it's like "to be attached, to be included".Does づき make it a verb An adverb Or what is itIs it a state "being attached to a TV" Or is it an action "do not attach yourself to a TV"2nd question about ようにして見る.As I understand ようにする is "to try".So as て-form + みる.Doesn't it make it kind of redundant to use both at the same time Is it commonThanks guys.

If they are translated literally it gives "today is" and "tonight is". Is it some sentence that got shortened (Also not sure how to classify this question so forgive me if I used the wrong tags...)
I'm not sure if this off-topic for this site but I would like to know what "正宗で大根を切る。  言い出しっぺ。" means. I tried translating it through google but I don't think it translated it properly. I found this on a user's profile. Thanks!
I am currently practicing Japanese by reading a novel but I have reached a sentence that I could not understand. ごうと音がして Can you please translate the vocabulary and verb used along with any unique sentence structure/grammar it may have. Thank you.If it helps, the full context is 「問答、無用」 ごうと音がして、魔女の手の中で火炎が燃え盛る。 I understand that the beginning reads "These questions are useless" and the last part reads "Fire blazed from inside the witch's hand," but I have no clue about the middle part.
From a small discussion on chat, I currently can think of three categories where the word is usually written in:Hiragana but have kanji (成る, 有る, [炬燵]{こたつ}, etc)Katakana but have kanji ([頁]{ページ}, [米]{メートル}, 亜米利加, 亜細亜, etc)Katakana but have an alternate word that can be written with kanji (米国, etc)I have a few questions about these:How commonly are these kanji used instead of their kanaIn what situations are these kanji used instead of their kanaI've seen some of the #1 types used in some doujinshi with some written using the kanji and others written with the kana. Is there some kind of difference between writing some in kanji and others in kana such as if using some feels like old writingI've seen some of the #2 types used on some websites, specifically 頁, such as this one (「106頁」) but then they don't use it again elsewhere (「ページ数」). Why is thisAlso, assume I'm talking about jouyou or otherwise relatively simple kanji.
The sentence is this one: 私は立場的に何を着てくのが正しいんだろうって思って。。。I think I got the rough meaning of the sentence: I (私) am wondering (思って) what's (何を) is the right thing (が正し) to wear (着) for her position (立場的に).But, I'm still puzzled over the meaning of the bolded parts.
I have found several pairs of kanji that are pronounced the same and mean the same when they are used individually:目 and 眼足 and 脚木 and 樹This especially bugs me because, in Chinese (my native language), the latter ones are almost exclusively used when by themselves.I had a small discussion about this but we didn't really come to any conclusion other than they are used interchangeably.I currently have a few questions about this:Are they be used completely interchangeably without changing meaning (not connotation)Is one used more commonly than the other I'm assuming the former ones are.Do they give any "feeling" such as old, formal, mystical, etcRemember, this is only when the characters are used individually and not part of compound words. Also ignore their usage in expressions/idioms/proverbs.Also, I would be interested if there are other kanji pairs like this.
Of course I'm talking about casual writing as opposed to formal or polite writing.There are many 新字体 that were kind of "half" simplified in to the equivalent simplified Chinese forms such as 関 and 広 (just randomly picking) where the simplified Chinese equivalent would be 关 and 广.Then there are kanji that aren't simplified at all such as 門, 個 and 機 where the Chinese simplified would be 门, 个 and 机.Furthermore there are characters that only get simplified when they are radicals such as 金 in 銀 that gets simplified to 银 in Chinese.My question is that are these simplified Chinese versions of the kanji sometimes used in place of the Japanese version This is mainly concerning the characters that end up with less strokes in simplified Chinese compared to Japan's versions since they would (usually) be faster to write.
This question showed the following:言わない (negative)言わなく・ない (negative+negative)言わなく・なかった (negative+negative+past)I've never seen this conjugation before. Why would you have a negative + negative Where is that coming from How does that work exactly
In a previous question, I posted a list of adjectives produced from verbs using the しい suffix.  In each example, it seems that しい attaches directly to the 未然形:勇む　　→　　勇ま　＋　しい　　　 isam-a-sii  悩む　　→　　悩ま　＋　しい　　　 nayam-a-sii  喜ぶ　　→　　喜ば　＋　しい　　　 yorokob-a-sii  妬む　　→　　妬ま　＋　しい　　　 netam-a-sii  呪う　　→　　呪わ　＋　しい　　　 norow-a-sii  慕う　　→　　慕わ　＋　しい 　　　shitaw-a-sii  好む　　→　　好ま　＋　しい 　　　konom-a-sii In all of the above words, it appears that the 未然形 has the -a- surface form.However, in these three words, it seems that it has the -o- surface form:好む　　→　　好も　＋　しい　　　 konom-o-sii  狂う　　→ 　　狂お　＋　しい　　　 kuruw-o-sii　  頼む　　→　　頼も　＋　しい 　　　 tanom-o-sii What I'd read previously is that -a- and -o- are both considered the same underlying form because of the sound change /au/ → /o:/.  In other words, the -o- surface form is underlyingly -a-, but changes to -o- as part of /o:/.However, these three adjectives do not contain the long vowel /o:/, so I don't think that explains why they have an -o-.  And if this is the result of a sound change, it doesn't appear to be a regular sound change, because most adjectives have -a-.  In fact, both konom-o-sii and kuruw-o-sii have -a- versions:kuruw-o-sii　　　kuruw-a-sii 　　konom-o-sii　　　konom-a-sii 　　tanom-o-sii　　　*tanom-a-sii 　　(I can't find evidence that ×頼ましい exists)So how can these -o- forms be explained
I have been searching around, but all the sources give completely different answers ranging from 2,000 to 50,000. So my question is how many Kanji characters that have ever existed since the dawn of time Does this include unofficial characters
As far as I know an adjective can be before noun(for ex. 美しい花) or before other adjective, but with て(for ex. 寂しくて眠れない夜). But in the following sentence「指定席みたいなコジンマリとした少年 」- this part is a bit of odd. Of course maybe I'm just don't know something, so can you please explain this part to me  格好いいよりも可愛い路線で売っていきたいアイドル集団の末席が指定席みたいなコジンマリとした少年のような笑顔を向けてみた。Thank you very much for help!
I have found a small Shodo fragment stating "一味一禪" - which is not the classical "Zen and Tea are of one taste" (禅茶一味).What is this supposed to mean Is it correct Japanese (I suppose it is, coming from an actual Japanese, but she is not here to explain it at the moment).
〇〇さんにプレゼントをもらいました。　〇〇さんからプレゼントをもらいました。I feel it is more natural to use particle に, but I'm not a native speaker. Can someone please help me out on this Both these options are listed in the current text I'm using to teach my students, but I want to be able to explain in further detail. I also wish to advise them of the difference between the use of the two and which is more common.
I'm a bit of confused with と in the following sentence, what does it mean here and how can we translate the whole sentenceその名に恥じず放置すればするだけ存分と進行してくれればそれは非常に楽だけど。Thank you very much for help!
As a follow-up to Would 私は怖い mean "I'm scared" or "I'm scary"We know that 怖い can mean both "to be scared" and "to be scary to somebody".What about the difference between 怖い and 恐いOr more general 怖 and 恐How does 恐 come to mean such different things as:恐らく （おそらく） – regrettably  恐竜 （きょうりゅう） – dinosaur
Or does it mean both If so, is there any way to explicitly distinguish between "I'm scared" and "I'm scary"If it only means one and not the other, how would you say the other
This is a conversation between two people:A: [金]{かね}は？ B: いつもの[通]{とお}りだ。それより[公安]{こうあん}の[方]{ほう}は？ A: 心配するな。 私がついている。A: The moneyB: Planned as always. Aside from that, public safety の方は？A: Don't worry. We're with you.I'm not understanding what the の方は？ is doing. Or what it's supposed to mean.
Judging from examples I've seen, these are some differences I think there are:始める:1: More formal than 出す2: When the focus in more on the beginning of the verb than the verb itself3: When the action is deliberate and/or under control. 出す:1: When the action occurs spontaneously or without ones control.2: More colloquial than 始める3: Less focus on the beginning itself than 始めるAre any of the observations I made incorrect, or is there perhaps some differences I've missed
I know Google hits aren't necessarily reliable, but I nonetheless searched for the following two forms:暖かかった - 約 2,770,000 件暖かった - 約 2,810,000 件The numbers are much further apart if I search for the -い form:暖かい - 約 41,900,000 件暖い - 約 97,500 件As I understand it, 暖かった is considered prescriptively incorrect because it looks like the past form of the non-existent adjective ×あたたい.  However, if this form has really become more common than 暖かかった, then I suppose it's an acceptable form.  Unfortunately, I can't base that conclusion on Google hits alone, so I decided to ask here.  My guess is that it's easier to say あたたかった than あたたかかった, so one of the かs gets dropped.If you can drop the か, I'm curious whether you can contract あたた to あった at the same time, as in option four below:あたたかかった - 約 122,000 件あたたかった - 約 211,000 件あったかかった - 約 395,000 件あったかった - 約 376,000 件Are all four of these forms in common usage  Are some of them considered non-standard or colloquial
As the title says^^　I think 生徒 is for elementary school, what about the other two
How do I make sense of the 終助詞 もん as inおいしいもん  そうなんだもんAlthough I have only heard it in 時代劇 speak, I guess it comes from もの, which I think should be も + の.But what も can follow the 終止形 and what の can follow that も. Is も the same も that roughly means "also" Is の the nominalizer の hereP.S. I am not asking what it means, when it is used, etc. I want to know how to make sense of it grammatically. At the moment, it has also been suggested that もん・もの derived from 物, but it seems to follow different rules than what one would expect of a particle derived from a noun.
The other day I read the word どれだけ which means how long; how much; to what extent. I've read several example sentences, and I that's all well and good, but I cannot shake the feeling that it's really counter-intuitive to me. If どれ　means which; whichever; any and だけ means only; just, I would guess combining them would give some sort of exclusive amount, for example in "Only this many people may enter" or something along those lines.I may be reading too much into this (or it's gone way over my head), but it still seems strange to me. Are there other question words that have だけ in them I did a cursory trail-and-error search, and couldn't find any.
According to the book I'm reading, both of these sentences translate to: “I bought a bag when I went back to my country”.国へ帰るとき、かばんを買いました。国へ帰ったとき、かばんを買いました。Now the nuance, if I understand correctly, is that #1 is saying that "on the way" to the country, she bought a bag. In other words, she bought the bag en route but before she arrived at her country. #2 is she arrived at her country and then bought the bag.Is my understanding correct
The following speech is from a video game called ファイアーエムブレム 新・暗黒竜と光の剣:　　父上に万一の事があれば  　　マルスは  　　アリティア王家唯一の男子。  　　世界でただ1人の  　　神剣ファルシオン  　　継承者となるのです。  　　あの子は  　　アリティアの希望  　　アリティアの未来。  　　そのあの子を…マルスを  　　私たちに代わって  　　導いてやってください。I'm confused about the combination of その with あの.  I remember learning something like:この - in the speaker domainその - in the listener domainあの - in neither domainI don't see how 子 can be both "in the listener domain" and "in neither domain" at the same time, so I don't think that's the right way to interpret it.  What's going on here(I think it's related to the earlier mention of あの子 somehow, so I highlighted that, too.)
On my bookshelf I have a book on formal speech, 敬語{けいご}, and it delineates respectful speech, 尊敬語{そんけいご}, from humble speech, 標準語{ひょうじゅんご}. And it combines both of these with polite speech, 丁寧語{てねいご}, as a matter of course.This question mentioned another form of speech, 丁重語{ていちょうご}, which I've never really encountered. Maybe I just don't hang out with the emperor enough...The dictionary defines it as "courteous speech", and I found other definitions online that say it "refers to language that is used to deprecate oneself." But that doesn't really tell me enough to help me differentiate it from 標準語{ひょうじゅんご}. I looked it up on Japanese Wikipedia, but I have to admit, reading about how to use Japanese in Japanese does my head in a bit.When is it used, and what differentiates it from other forms of formal speech
Unlike some languages (English, French, ...), written Japanese sentences don't have spaces between words. I know that it is the same in Chinese for example, but the fact that the Chinese language only use one alphabet (hanzi) makes it easier to split words, most of the time it is 1 or 2 characters for each word.I also know that a lot of it comes from knowing vocabulary/grammar to be able to know where each word begins and ends, but I was wondering if there were any tips that can be used to be able to differentiate them
With whom is it considered proper to use 尊敬語・謙譲語・丁重語 instead of 丁寧語I mean saying おいでになります・伺います・参ります instead of 行きます.The often given example is for a service-person speaking with a customer, but what about when speaking with 先生 or coworkersIn particular, inside a company, would it be normal to use 尊敬語・謙譲語・丁重語　with anyone older or higher in rank It seems like that might be too excessive. Does usage depend on factors such as context or personality
What would be the Japanese equivalent of the word operation, in the sense of a project or taskSome examples would be:Operation Infiltrate-the-CastleOperation Human Shield (from South Park)Operation random cool nameIn English this usage obviously comes from a military background, but what is the corresponding Japanese term And more importantly, would you use this in the same tongue-in-cheek manner as in English, to glorify some task or project and make it sound exciting
As far as I know when we talking about other people thoughts in japanese we have to use something like よう、と思う etc.  But I've got a problem in the following sentence, I cannot understand と考え here about 澪, though I'm not sure if it's correct, or about 俺  俺は澪が用意してくれた問題集を前に眉を寄せている。  それは、指定された範囲で高得点をとることが出来れば、明日の再テストでおまずまずの結果を残せるだろうと考え、澪が選んでくれたものだった。Thank you very much for help!
On chat, Chocolate helped me find some examples of adjectives produced from verbs using the しい suffix.  In the following examples, it appears to attach directly to the 未然形:勇む　　→　　勇ま　＋　しい      悩む　　→　　悩ま　＋　しい      喜ぶ　　→　　喜ば　＋　しい      妬む　　→　　妬ま　＋　しい      呪う　　→　　呪わ　＋　しい      慕う　　→　　慕わ　＋　しい      好む　　→　　好ま　＋　しい      好む　　→　　好も　＋　しい      頼む　　→　　頼も　＋　しいBut in these last two examples, there seems to be an extra わ inserted:嘆く　　→　　嘆か　＋　わ　＋　しい      忌む　　→　　忌ま　＋　わ　＋　しいI can't seem to find a dictionary entry for わ or わしい.  What is this わ
What is the difference between Konnichiwa and Konbanwa Is it appropriate to use either one in everyday conversations
My Japanese lesson has an oral exam, the title is しゅみについて. Can anyone explain what is the meaning of the title Can I start the conversation with this しゅみについてどう思いか？
I was wondering if there was some kind of rules to differentiate them, or if it was something we have to remember, like spelling in English.The same question can also extend to お vs おう ; I learned that the "o" sound in おう is longer, but it can be hard to differentiate them in a speech for a beginner like me.Thanks for the answers :)
I am a musician playing the Marimba. Because quite a bit of music for marimba is written by famous Japanese composers, occasionally I come across some Japanese text I would like to understand.In the piece "Two methods of Movement for Marimba", written by Toshimitsu TANAKA, there is, on the 6th page, a Glissando (moving with the sticks along all bars) with a star. At the bottom of the page, the star is printed again, this time with a note in Japanese.(Full images: glissando &amp; note.)★撥の音も加えたgliss.I would be very grateful if someone could unveil the meaning of that sentence.
I'm wondering, for adjectives such as 太い and　悲しい that also have a progressive "to be" verb counterpart (i.e., 太っている and 悲しんでいる), what is the difference between using the i-adjective form and the verb formE.g.:  太っている人 vs　太い人。　悲しんでいる人　vs 悲しい人。
I understand surnames and given names usually have some reason for existing, and have existed for several years. My question, I guess, really is: if someone were making up a completely different name for themselves and wanted to use kanji in their surname (or given name) could they use any combination of sounds (and any of their corresponding kanji) and still get a comprehensible nameFor instance, in English, I could say that Schterice is a name, but it really wouldn't make any sense and most people would think it was strange. It had no history and doesn't really seem to stem from any known names. Still, it would still be a valid name, yes I would like to know if the same would apply to Japanese namesIt seems like a really strange question, but I am confused. Please and thank you, in advance.
I know that the wave dash 〜 can be used in place of the long vowel marker ー sometimes, but I'm not exactly sure what the differences are.Is there any difference in pronunciation  I read once that it represents a "tremolo", but I'm not sure if that's right.When is it appropriate  According to Wikipedia, it's "usually for comic or cute effect".  Is that a fair summary
I'm curious how 冷やかし came to mean things such as 買わずに見る and からかう. Here's what I can figure out:hiya seems to be a root meaning "cold" (like in hiya-ya-ka)hiya-k-u is an old verb based on this root ("to become cold")hiya-k-as-u is the same verb plus a causative affix ("to make cold")hiya-k-as-i is a noun derived from the 連用形 of this verbSo it seems that "to make cold" is the literal meaning of the verb, and it can still be written with the kanji 冷.  However, it doesn't appear that the noun 冷やかし retains this literal meaning--at least, I don't see it anywhere in 大辞林:ひやかし0 【冷やかし・〈素見〉】相手が困ったり恥ずかしがったりするような冗談を言うこと。からかうこと。  　　―半分に言っただけだ買う気がないのに値段をきいたり品定めしたりすること。また、その人。素見(すけん)。  　　―客遊里で、登楼せず張り見世の遊女をからかったり品定めしたりすること。また、その人。素見。   I suppose these three senses are probably related to the literal meaning, but I can't see the connection.  How did the meaning go from "make cold" to "window shopping"
I have always been interested in the negative polite (〜ません) and negative past-polite (〜ませんでした) inflections of verbs.My understanding is that ます is an inflectable function word (助動詞), so I'm wondering why the negative form ends with ん. Is that a contraction of ぬ perhaps (Also why is the 未然形 ませ rather than something more regular, like まさ)The really weird thing for me is でした (the past inflection of the polite copula), showing up for the negative past-polite form. Has this always been the way to handle this sort of semantics, even in Classical Japanese, or is this a recent introduction to the languageAlthough I think there is probably no really satisfying answer to why things are like this, I do think it'd be interesting to know how things evolved through time, so any answers revealing some of that information are welcome!
And no, this isn't about property sizes in Japan!As Katakana Mysteries: 6 loan words Japan got wrong put it:Bill Gates or Warren Buffet might be very surprised if they were to  buy a Japanese manshon, only to find upon their arrival something a  bit less grand than they envisioned, and that they would be sharing it  with quite a few other people.The English edition of Wiktionary claims that it is derived from English:EtymologyFrom English mansion.Note that while English “mansion” most commonly means “large house”,  it is also occasionally used to mean “luxurious apartment”, the latter  usage being followed in Japanese.And the English language Wiktionary article talks about mansion meaning "A luxurious flat" being UK English, which I've heard was the main source of English in the 19th century.Japanese English - 10 Truly Bizarre Examples Of Wasei-Eigo claims it might be borrowed from French:マンション (mansion)Don't get too excited if you're moving to Japan to live in a mansion.  These mansions are actually condominiums. I have no idea how this  creation came about. Some of the mansions I've seen in Japan were less  than luxurious. Is it a joke I suspect it might be a borrowed word  from French.Is 「マンション」 derived from English, or French And did Japanese mess up the meaning of "mansion", or were they being faithful to a meaning that is rarely used nowadays
赤字 and 黒字 seem to correspond directly to the English expressions 'red ink' and 'black ink', meaning a (financial) deficit/loss and surplus, respectively. If Wiktionary is to be trusted, Mandarin, Cantonese and Korean use 赤字 in the same way. Furthermore, French has the expression être dans le rouge ('to be in the red').Etymonline lists the first recorded instance of 'red ink' in English as being from 1929, and 語源由来辞典 asserts that 赤字 and 黒字 spread in Japanese during the 大正時代 (1912-1926) to the start of 昭和時代 (1926-1989).How did 赤字 and 黒字 come to be used in Japanese Are the terms borrowed from a European language (or vice versa), or did the practice of using red ink for losses and black ink for profits arise independently
I came across this phrase today while doing a lookup on 背中.    背中で教えるI checked several sources, and all listed the meaning, amongst others, "to teach with one's back". It seems related to learning by example, such as when growing up how you learn from your parents or older siblings. Things related to manners, morals and in general "how to get along in the world".But as far as I searched, I could not find good example sentences using this phrase. I found some examples herehttp://ejje.weblio.jp/content/%E8%83%8C%E4%B8%AD%E3%81%A7%E6%95%99%E3%81%88%E3%82%8Bbut these seem to be general teaching references in a historical setting.So I am wondering if this phrase has a historical background, and also where the "back" reference came from. Learning while watching someone from behind
I have a question regarding えば〜ほど. My understanding of it is that it means, the more/less (property), the more/less (property).If I want to say, the more experiences one has, the more ~ , should it be経験があればあるほど、〜or経験が多ければ多いほど、〜The second one seems slightly confusing to me, because in many example sentences that I see, such asその本は、読めば読むほどわからなくなるThe more you read the book, the less you will understand it.The more/less part is embedded in the construction えば〜ほど, so the second option 経験が多ければ多いほど、〜 would translate into: The more more experiences one has. Am I getting it wrong
I just confuse about kanji. I just learn a bit of kanji. But I want to know when exactly we use it is there a rule about that
What's a polite way of asking in an email if you've received a previous emailIn my case, "polite" means "I'm emailing the tourism information staff of a place that mainly deals with domestic tourists, and I don't want to be seen as a rude foreigner".
I'm still playing Game Boy Wars Advance 2, and I keep running into colloquial forms I'm unfamiliar with.  Here's one I haven't been able to look up:じゃ、さっそく、はじめよっか。My guess is that はじめよっか is a colloquial form of はじめようか.  Is that right  If so, can I generalize and say okka is a colloquial form of ooka  Image for context:
I've read lots of mangas and seen many animes, and it seems a Japanese person can have virtually any kind of name (the meaning of a name can be something completely ridiculous). Is it true in real life, or is this only for the purpose of amusement, and it doesn't actually occur in reality
This could be just me, but at first glance the word (phrase) 人一倍【ひといちばい】 looks like it would mean "one's own share of the work". I assumed 人 to mean one person, and 一倍【いちばい】 means "one share, one amount". I was a little confused to find out that 人一倍 actually means "more than others, redoubled, unusual". (For example, 人一倍働く【ひといちばいはたら】 means " to work twice as hard as others".)Does anyone have any insight or explanation for this, or have I completely misunderstood the whole thing
There's this manga that is called へうげもの. However, this name is romanized as Hyouge Mono. Although I know little Japanese, I think the kana there spell something like Heuge Mono.  Why does this happen, and what does it mean
It's difficult to tell what is being asked here. This question is ambiguous, vague, incomplete, overly broad, or rhetorical and   cannot be reasonably answered in its current form.

Closed 7 years ago.I'm trying to write a simple Japanese composition using phrases I have learnt (yes, it's homework). I encountered a number of questions.Below I have listed what I intend to say in English, and my translation. I have bolded the parts which I am unsure of whether the usage is correct. His birthday is on 28 January and he is 25 years old this year. たんじょうびはいちがつにじうはちにちです。そしてことしにじうごさいです。&gt;&gt;Is my usage of そして to join the sentence correct here Also, is ことし necessaryHe has 4 members in his family.Peter-さんのごかぞくはよにんです。&gt;&gt;Should I be using ごかぞく or just かぞく hereEvery Friday after class, we go out to eat lunch. He is very stingy, so we always go to cheap restaurants.まいきんようびいっしょにレストランでひるごはんをたへます。かれはとてもけちですから、いつもやすいのレストランへいきます。&gt;&gt;Should I use 私たしたち or いっしょに For the second bolded part, I'm not even sure if it makes sense in japanese.I like to eat spicy food, but he does not.わたしはからいたべものがだいすきですが、かれはからいたべものがすきじゃありません。&gt;&gt;Is this correct It does not seem too elegant if you ask me.After, we sometimes watch movies at cinemas. それから、ときとえいがかんでえいがをみます。&gt;&gt;Is my usage of ときどきhere correctWe like action movies because we lack action in our life.わたしたちのせいかつはあまりおもしろいくないですから、アクションのえいががすきです。&gt;&gt;Is my translation here accurate Does this sentence make senseWe love to drink and smoke.わたしたちはおさけをのみますとたばこをすいますがだいすきです。&gt;&gt;Is it necessary to have をのみます and をすいます hereOften, we do it all over again on saturday too.よこ、どようびはもいちどします。&gt;&gt;This is probably all wrong, yeaThis summer I will go on a phillipines trip with him.はちがつからのやすみにオーストラリアりょこうする。&gt;&gt;Do I need to end with a です for this sentencePhew. I hope my formatting makes it a little more bearable!
This is something I've always wondered about, but can't find any info about.When native speakers come across a sentence that ends ...を。, ...と。 or ...が！*, how do their brains parse it Is it just a case of being able to guess what word would follow based on their past exposure to collocations (words that go together with other words) and situationsI found this question to which the answers say it's verb ellipsis, which I get, but I'd like to know if there's any way of knowing exactly which verb – if there is indeed only one particular possibility — or whether the hidden verb belongs to a small group of verbs which are often omitted. For example, on TV an announcer said something like 次の日はすごい状態に！ I asked a Japanese friend what the verb would be and they immediately said なった. Is it likely they knew this from collocational knowledge, the same way an English speaker could finish the sentence running around like a chicken with... And could なった have just as easily been a different verb it was a different situation, or is 状態に always followed by なる if the verb is dropped*(not the が that means "but"; the other one. I have no idea how to interpret sentences that end with が – it's the most difficult one for me.)More examples: Here and here
In my JLPT textbook, they have this sentence:自分{じぶん}のない者{もの}に表現{ひょうげん}もへったくれもない。The book provides a translation, which is this:You can't talk about expression if you have none (of your own ideas).(The "of your own ideas" part is built on the context from the previous paragraph.)I'm having trouble seeing how we get to that translation, partly because I'm not sure about the use of へったくれもない. According to my dictionary, へったくれ is an expression meaning "to be damned", as in, "to heck with it". So I would understand the sentence if it just ended there, but there's a もない as well, which would seem to reverse that, meaning, in my mind, that you can't discount self expression from someone without ideas.Or maybe I'm not parsing it right, and it's not へったくれ, but the へる is something else, like 減る.I don't know. It just confuses me. How do the parts of the sentence combine to end up with the translation given

I've read on Stack Exchange that どうやって can be used to mean "what did you do in order to x"どうやってお医者になったか — What did you do in order to become  a doctorThis definition makes a lot of sense to me, but can どうして be used in the same wayAlso, I've heard some people say that どうやって can mean "By what means did you x", exactly like 何で.Does this mean that the following is validどうやって作文を書いたか — What did you use to write your essayAlso, besides どうして being able to mean "why", what is the difference between どうやって and どうして
I'm curious what the relationship is between む and ん.  I have the feeling that sometimes, む is pronounced more like ん:むむむ: is this really /mumumu/  Or does it become /mmm/うむむ: is this really /umumu/  Or does it become /umm/I've spent more time reading than listening, and I'm not sure where I picked this idea up.  I did see on Wikipedia that ん was formerly written む.  Unfortunately, the article doesn't say anything about the two being related in modern Japanese.I'm also aware of うむ, which is apparently an older version of うん.  Perhaps this is an example of something similarHere is an example context for むむむ, in which I suspect it is not actually pronounced /mumumu/:
Topology in English is called 位相幾何学 in Japanese; also, topological space is called 位相空間. But why is topology called 位相幾何学 What is the correspondence between topo and 位相 What is the origin of 位相
I've noticed that when Japanese is written mostly or entirely in kana, it's often written with spaces.  For example, a lot of old video games had spaces.  I've also seen this in children's books:Is there a standard or official way of choosing where to insert these spaces, or at least a common convention  It seems to be done quite differently than in romanized Japanese.  I'd like to be able to do this correctly, if there is such a thing as correctly in this context.
I'm still playing Game Boy Wars Advance 2, and it contains this dialogue:聞いたことあるような無いような・・・  どこの軍でしたっけ？The first sentence has me confused.  My intuition tells me the meaning of the sentence is "I might have heard of that, or I might not..." but I can't figure out how to get to that meaning from the words.  The grammar doesn't make sense to me.When I try to analyze it, I come up with three parts:聞いたこと (a subject with the particle が omitted)あるような (動詞「ある」+ 助動詞「ようだ」の連体形)無いような (形容詞「無い」+ 助動詞「ようだ」の連体形)But that doesn't make sense to me--what do 2 and 3 modify  There's no noun at the end.  Besides that, it seems like 2 and 3 contradict, so I don't understand how they can both modify something at the same time.  I must have got it wrong.Besides, if I add ようだ to a sentence, doesn't it parse like this[ 聞いたことがある ] ようだ[ 聞いたことがない ] ようだThat is, if I understand correctly, ようだ doesn't just attach to the verb at the end.  It attaches to the whole sentence.  So what I wrote above doesn't make any sense.So how can I make sense of あるような無いような  Can 〜ような〜ような be used to list alternatives  I looked up ようだ, but I didn't see anything like that.
I'm working on my Japanese homework, and we're practicing describing weather. We're given charts on temperature to say things like: カイロは九月が一番あついです。Or, "In Cairo, September is the hottest month."However, my book does not include how to say something like "In Cairo, June through (the end of) November are the hottest months."I was wondering if anyone has any solutions on this.Thanks!Edit: Addressed a question as the specificity of the phrase in English.
At the start of this book the family are stated to be from 亀田町{かめだまち}, an area which is now part of 新潟市{にいがたし}, but it's also set historically (1919 at the start of the book). I'm presuming the specific dialect used is 新潟弁 but I'm not 100% sure.Here, the father of the family responds to his wife's comment that the name he's picked for their daughter sounds like a boy's name:「お前はそういうろと思うてたったろも」From what I can understand of 越後方言{えちごほうげん} from the internet:そういうだろう→そういうろ (and this ending could also be だろ・ろー in some cases)思って→思うて (from the context, although I'm not entirely sure on this)いた→いたった→たった　（Described as "過去重複形" on Wikipedia and I am assuming that the い is dropping out of 〜ていた)けど→ろも (Also ども could be used here)So the meaning is, unless I'm hopelessly off-base roughly "I thought you'd say that..." (and he goes on to explain his reasoning for the name).  I'd like confirmation that this is correct, and any additional information on nuances I might be missing.
I started playing another old game, Game Boy Wars Advance 2, and I ran across this bit of dialogue:ま、どのみち、マクロランドに行きゃあ、  いやでも戦わなきゃなんねえんだ。I think this is something like:ま、どのみち、マクロランドに行けば、  いやでも戦わなければならないのだ。Thanks to a helpful comment by Tsuyoshi Ito, I learned that おけば can be contracted to おきゃ.  More generally, I learned that e + ば can be contracted to ゃ (small や).  Based on this rule, I'm guessing that 行きゃ is a contraction of 行けば.Of course, the dialogue I quoted says 行きゃあ, not 行きゃ.  My guess is that e + ば can also be contracted to ゃあ, and based on this I guess that both 行きゃあ and 行きゃ are contracted forms of 行けば.  Is this correct(My other guess is that perhaps it's 行ければ...)
Help me please with translation 働かせっぱなし in the following sentenceそれって、朝からずっと働かせっぱなしの人間に対して、掛ける言葉じゃ、ないと思うんだけどThe main problem is that I cannot understand how to correctly translate 働かせっぱなしの人間, could it be "person who is forcing somebody to work" or "person who is forced by somebody to work", while I think that the second one would be passive form 「働かせられっぱなしの人間」it seems to me better with context... I'm sorry for my bad English, and thanks for help.
Well, the title says it.The sentence is from a manga, where a boy lives together with his very lazy aunt, so the boy has to take care of laundry, cleaning, dishes, cooking etc. while she's drinking beer.He gets angry and she explains that it's a pain to do all that stuff (cooking, cleaning etc) on her own.Then he replies "僕が来る前からこーだったんですが"Does it mean "Then how did you manage it before I came here" or does it rather mean "So were you like this even before I came here"
When checking dictionaries (jisho.org and Wiktionary) for お名前, I found that it wasn't listed as お名前, but only as 名前. Do most dictionaries strip bikago from all words, or do they typically strip bikago only from some words
I've always learned that 見えない means "unseen" or "invisible".However, lately I've been seeing quite a few Japanese people in online games that, upon failing to complete some (usually very difficult) task, post stuff like "みえないわｗ" or "見えないこれ".I've come to the conclusion that it's supposed to mean something similar to 無理, as in they "don't see success happening", but Google hasn't been able to back me up on this theory. So now I'm wondering if that's actually a meaning of the term, if it's purely colloquial, or if there's some other concept behind all of this.Thanks!
As the title says. I found it on weblio dictionary and it says ある人がその事に当たる。, but that doesn't help me a lot, as I can't find example sentences (and the one I have on the book I'm reading isn't too clear as well). Can someone help me please
There are several one-character surnames: [林]{はやし}　[森]{もり}　[堤]{つつみ}Most surnames have two-characters: [鈴木]{すずき} [山田]{やまだ} [藤井]{ふじい} [酒井]{さかい} [松村]{まつむら}A few surnames have three-characters: [佐々木]{ささき} [長谷川]{はせがわ} [五十住]{いそずみ} [中小路]{なかこうじ}It may be an incorrect assumption, but save for 佐々木 and 長谷川 it seems like people with 3-character names tend to be the most likely to have a pre-Meiji era name (have been upper class prior to that era).Is there any reason behind the number of characters in a surname being longer for the upper class Is it just coincidence
I have this sentence in my flashcards, which I pulled from a JLPT textbook of mine a while back. Long enough ago that I've lost the source. It looks strange to me now, though, and I wonder if maybe I copied it down wrong:ためらいもはず告白{こくはく}したI believe it means, "didn't hesitate to confess (my) feelings."Because はず is in there, I think it implies that it was expected that the speaker ordinarily might have hesitated, but managed to confess anyway. Shouldn't it be:ためらいもはずけど告白{こくはく}した... or...ためらいもはずが、告白{こくはく}した... or something like that Without some kind of "but..." or "although..." type of connection to glue the sentence together, it seems half formed to me.Is the original sentence complete If so, what am I missing about the grammar that makes it complete If not, how should it be completed
In the phrase かといって or かと言って, meaning having said that, on the other hand, I'm not sure what the か and と are.My first guess is that these are the generic particles (か+と+いって), but I couldn't find any evidence to suggest that　(or, for that matter, to refute it).Of course, I could be over thinking this, so it could be a "that's just how it is said" kind of phrase.

I read 遅ランチ and while I think the meaning is pretty clear ("late lunch" unless I'm mistaken), I wasn't sure how to read it. I wanted to say おそ, but the lack of okurigana suggests to me that isn't the case. This leads me to guess that it's チ which is the on'yomi. Is it 遅{ち}ランチ, or is the okurigana implied perhaps, i.e. 遅{おそい}ランチ, or am I over thinking this and it's just 遅{おそ}ランチ.Or D: None of the above.
On NHK NewsWatch 9 yesterday, they were talking about the shortage of emergency room doctors, and the resulting situations lately  where hospitals were forced to turn away emergency patients. In many cases there was a doctor on duty, but not qualified to treat some emergencies. So the doctor would refuse the patient rather than treat the patient and possibly get sued if something went wrong.While interviewing a doctor, this phrase was shown in the subtitleその頑張りは、すべてむだというかそういう気持ちになる。 (I did not think to listen to the Japanese audio, though I suppose its what he said.)The English dubbed audio said  There's a saying "Honest people only make fools of themselves."  I can understand the intent though I have not heard such a saying  before.Regarding the Japanese sentence, is this a set phrase (or saying) of some kindAs best as I can make out it is saying "As for endurance, resulting good feelings or such are said to be entirely useless." or "Resulting good feelings or such are said to be entirely useless, so endure it.", although its likely I'm wrong.Especially I don't think I quite understand  というかそういう.

I'm curious what the numerical base the Japanese used before their introduction to the wider western world. I've been taught in my Japanese language classes that they move the comma to a different place (1'0000 rather than 1,000) but that's just a question of notation and have learned that there have been a great number of loan words in Japanese.I'm curious what they used before they met the Portuguese, for example, in 1543.
My friend is reading a book, and it contains the following sentence:すると、高畑は外国人のように両手を上げる仕草をした。Why does this say 外国人のように  Are foreigners known for a particular gesture in which we raise both our arms...  When I read this sentence, I feel like I'm missing some implication that's required for it to make sense.I have a picture of the page this sentence is from, in case further context is helpful:
I saw this on an advertisement outside the construction site of a company that makes wooden houses:木{き}の家{いえ}と、暮{く}らそう。I'm trying to think of a way to translate it other than:Live with a wooden house. (sounds like the house is your roommate) Spend your life with a wooden house. (a bit weird)Experience a wooden house. (too different from the original)I have a sneaking suspicion that the copywriter was aiming for a variation on the construction ADVERB + と + VERB, for example, ゆうゆうと暮{く}らす or ぎりぎりで生活{せいかつ}する. This would make the meaning something resembling "Live, wood-house-ly" or "Live in a generally wooden-house-ish fashion."Any ideas P.S. The best part was that the actual attempt at translation was "Feel Wood." I took a photo (of course).

Closed 7 years ago.i know a small bit of Japanese from back in high school but stopped when it was never made clear that Japanese went for 2 semesters instead of 1 and by the time they told me about it (even though i was the first to submit my class registration papers) it was full, i have picked up some more from playing Visual Novels with voices and unofficial English Translations (Fate/Stay Night, Kamidori Alchemy Miester, Sono Hanabira)there are naturally hundred of resources saying that they will teach Japanese fast but i want to know how long on average it would takeThe level I'm hoping to reach is to the point where I can understand text in video games so that way i can play them while at the same time being fully immersed in the story (which is why I can just keep looking to a dictionary every time I see a word).I want to reach this level because I'm tired of having to wait to see if games get to be localized, even though i don't care if they get dubbed or not (Agarest: Generations of War is an example of a game that wasn't dubbed) and waiting forever for them to come out, even if they come out the limited edition items that originally was with the Japanese sales don't show up in the west a lot of the time.Money isn't a problem as I know it will benefit me greatly in the long term.
Here's a question from N3文法スピードマスター。英語も中国語もスペイン語もできる*なんて*、素晴らしいですねえ。This question is multiple-choice, so the other incorrect choices were: なんと、など、なんか just for your information.Here's my question:According to the book, it says that なんて is used to lighten or diminish the impact of the subject in question. Using that grammar point, my translation of the above question would be: Things like being able to do English and Chinese and Spanish is great. However, that translation doesn't seem to fit into the grammar point of なんて being derogatory, so right now I'm quite confused. What's the purpose of なんて in this question
なにかと思ったら, I have come across this sentence a couple of times when talking to Japanese people, but I seem to struggle with the actual meaning.I translate it as "if I am thinking of something" but the times I have seen it it doesn't make much sense. Here is a couple of example sentences I have seen it used with:"なにかと思ったらホルモンじゃないですか！笑 "andっていうか何かと思ったらPerfumeじゃないですかThe context of these sentences are them replying to me linking to a music video.
In Tae Kim's guide, he wrote a few example sentences:徹夜して、宿題することはある。一人で行くことはありません。パリに行ったことはありますか。お寿司を食べたことがある。そういうのを見たことがなかった。In these examples, I don't really understand why some sentences use が and some use は.
It occurred to me the other day that if ハ行転呼 had affected all applicable environments without exception, 母 /haha/ (or I guess properly it was /ɸaɸa/, right)should have become /hawa/.The Japanese wiki page for ハ行転呼 makes note of this and kind of handwaves it away by saying it's thought the relationship between 父/爺 and 母/婆 influenced 母 enough to keep its pronunciation from undergoing ハ行転呼, but there's no citation and it kinda just sounds to me like a "we have no clue" answer.特殊な例として「はは」（母）のように一旦「はわ」に変化したのち、再び「はは」に戻ったものもある。これは「ちち」（父）、「ぢぢ」（爺）に対応する「はは」（母）、「ばば」（婆）の体系を維持しようとして引き起こされた変化と考えられる。It does say 「一旦『はわ』に変化したのち」, so /haha/ (/ɸaɸa/) did become /hawa/ before changing (back) to /haha/.  Is this maybe a case of spelling pronunciation or a conscious effort on (educated) speakers' part to pronounce 母 in a deliberate, different way  I'm thinking like how some English speakers pronounce the "t" in often both because of its spelling and relationship to oft.Since I couldn't find citations or sources, I guess my question is basically: Did 母 undergo ハ行転呼 and then change (back) to /haha/  Or was it an exception to the rule from the get-go(And now that I'm thinking about it, I wonder if there are dialects that pronounce it /hawa/, or if there were until relatively recently.)

If 思われる is "its own verb," meaning "to seem;  to appear," and is independent of the separate verb 思う, meaning "to think," is there a conceptual relation between the two I ask because I initially thought 思われる to be the passive form of 思う. Would it be wrong to think of 思われる meaning "it is thought" rather than "it seems"意外に思われるかもしれません。  This may surprise you.このことは、私たちにはとても不思議に思われる。  This appears very strange to us.そのようなプロジェクトを経た後では、すべてがはるかにたやすいように思われる。  Having come from something like the project, it seems like everything is a lot easier.それは私には奇妙に思われる。  It seems strange to me.彼女はとても年をとっているように思われる。  She seems (to me) (to be) a very old woman.
I'd like to ask you a question about this honorific form.  I will give an example as detailed as possible to make this question clear.The verb yomu is often used in passive form to show respect:先生が新聞を読まれました - the addressee is not teacher, so is the passive form with the plain ending is used先生、新聞を読まれましたか。 - the addressee is the adressess, so the passive form with the polite ending is used.This honorific form compete with others such お読みになる (Honorific prefix + Renyoukei verbal stem + NI NARU). That is why I would like to know for which verbs, the passive honorific form is preferred to the Honorific prefix + Renyou verb + NI NARU
While listening to the song "Yasashisa no Riyuu", I noticed the following sentence:今は誰の名前でもない 輝きの彼方へ Which by the fansub is translated like this:Now it doesn't matter whose name it may be. Beyond the horizons light.However, I've been uable to find any information supporting that "でもない" can mean "independent of x (thing it is attached to)".I did however find an alternative translation online, which instead translates it as follows:Heading toward the shining yonder that isn’t named after anyone.Which seems to me as if でもない is merely the negation of でもある."でもない" is then used exactly like we would use じゃない (except with the added meaning of も)When applying what little knowledge I have, this translation seems to make the most sense to me.Now my questions are:1. Can でもない have some meaning beyond what is implied by the negation of でもある2. Which translation is correct

Here's the sentence:あるいはまた、東南アジアを中心に世界各地で活躍するいわゆる華僑勢力の多くが福建省出身者である事実を見ても、福建人たちの「海外雄飛」のパワーを知ることができる。My rough translation is something like:"Moreover, looking also at the fact that a large part of [...] are natives of Fujian, it is possible to understand the power of people from Fujian in going overseas"What troubles me most is that 華僑勢力: shouldn't 多く refer to 華僑 ("a large number of the so-called overseas Chinese merchants")Also, does 東南アジアを中心に世界各地で活躍するmean "active all over the world and particularly in South-East Asia"  How would I use this X を中心に Y pattern
This is one of the questions taken from the book 「N3文法スペードマスター」:そうじが楽（　）、部屋にはなるべく物を置かないようにしている。The blank in the bracket is to be filled with one from this set of choices:はず、のに、ため、ところ、べき、なのでI'm not too sure if I'm right or not, but I translated the second half of the sentence as this: I make it a point to, as much as possible, not leave stuff lying around in the room.After translating that, I proceeded to translate the first half as: cleaning is easy ( ), .From there, I thought of there being a relationship between the two halves as such: In order for cleaning to be easy, I make it a point to, as much as possible, not leave stuff lying around in the room.However, I cannot find any answer from the set of choices that could possibly fit that description, and the answer from the book was なので, which, as I would translate it, makes the sentence something like: Because cleaning is easy, I make it a point to, as much as possible, not leave stuff lying around in the room.(Edit: I chose ため as my answer. I kind of forgot that that answer seemed logical to me before I checked the book's answer and got confused.)That didn't really seem logical to me, and after pondering for awhile, I reasoned the answer as: I make it a point to, as much as possible, not leave stuff lying around in the room, because cleaning will be easy then.However, that brings up another question, which is how the discrepancy cleaning will be easy instead of cleaning is easy came about. Perhaps my translation of そうじが楽 is wrongThanks in advance! Hope my question is clear enough and doesn't sound lame.
In Yukio Mishima's "The Temple of the Golden Pavilion," (三島由紀夫によって書かれた「金閣寺」) one of the characters, Kashiwagi, writes a sentence over a poster:未知の人生とは我慢がならぬ。Here is the passage:それは日本アルプスを描いた旅行協会の美しい石版刷で、青空に浮かんだ白い山頂に、  「未知の世界へ、あなたを招く！」という活字が横書きになっていた。柏木は毒々しい朱筆で、その字と山頂を斜め十文字に抹消し、さてかたわらには、内反足の歩行を思わせる彼の踊るような自筆が、「未知の人生とは我慢がならぬ」と書きなぐっていた。In the English translation the sentence is written as,I can't stand an unknown life.Do you think this is the best translation Would the following be more accurate in meaningI won't put up with an unknown life.I guess my suggestion may be more faithful in meaning, but on second thought, perhaps the tone of the sentence is more faithfully translated in the book's attempt. Looking at the ならぬ, I think I remember the ~ぬ negation being literary in tone, which is not really reflected in the translation (but that might be asking too much.) Is this correct What do you think about the translation I have some other specific questions:In English the phrase, "an unknown life," is odd because it is ambiguous in meaning and can be interpreted in so many ways. It can mean "the life of an unknown person" ie, living an anonymous life. Or it can mean "a life about which nothing is known-- a life that we cannot understand."Is the meaning open to this much interpretation in the japanese phrase, "未知の人生"Does the phrase, "未知の人生" sounds odd in japanese

The question understanding 対する details [noun]に対する[noun], but what is the difference between [noun]に対しての[noun] and [noun]に対する[noun]Space ALC has a fair number of examples for both に対する and に対しての (though many more for に対する than に対しての).The 日本語文型辞典 defines に対する as:「それに対しての」「それに関しての」…「その問に対しての解答」のように、「NにたいしてのN」という形が用いられることもある。and 〜に対して as 「そのものごとに向けて／応じて」… with one of the examples being:現在容疑者に対しての取り調べが行われているところです。  "Presently there investigations being performed in regards with the suspect(s)."Would 容疑者に対しての取り調べ and 容疑者に対する取り調べ have the same meaning in that sentenceAre the two are always interchangeable, or are there some situations where one is more appropriate/natural than the other

I saw this pic on 9gag.com! I was able to read the following line perfectly (or maybe not): 何か来るんやろなとは思ったけどな. I'm not sure what it exactly means, but I have a feeling that this is slang.来る means to come, but what does 来るんやろな mean思った means "thought" and けど means something like "but". However, I do not know how the addition of な changes the meaning of the phrase.Here's the page from 9gag in which the image was posted:http://9gag.com/gag/6856310
I've always had trouble understanding か (question particle) in casual speech.  I read that in casual situations, か can be used to give the sentence an exasperated or sarcastic tone. Like in:負けっかよ！　As if I'd lose!I think that I understand that usage reasonably well.  What confuses me however is when か is used with a sentence that clearly should be a question (i.e. it has a question mark or a question word). For example:やってみるか？　Want to give it a tryI believe I've read that か is unnecessary (and not used) in casual speech to ask a question and questions are simply conveyed through a rising intonation or the addition of の（だ）.  Could someone explain how is the above sentence different in terms of tone or nuance from the same sentence omitting か 「やってみる？」Furthermore, on a similar note I believe, the sentence final particle combination のか？！ seems to occur frequently.  I'm not really sure what to make of this one.  I thought の　might be the explanatory の but how can one both explain and ask a question  For example:そんな嘘にオレがだまされっと思ってんのか！？  Do you think I'd be taken in by a lie like that! (I'm not confident of this translation)How would that sentence's meaning be affected if it were instead:そんな嘘にオレがだまされっと思ってんの！？ orそんな嘘にオレがだまされっと思ってんか！？Thank you very much for reading my post to the end : ). I know this question isn't that specific but any and all help is appreciated.  Thanks again!
This is from a Trigun soundtrack, song called Sound Life (lyrics), 3rd line:３つ目の夜に ワルツの子は世界面にウエーブを 打つThe 世界面 is translated as "world face", however pronunciation is given as よなも. I can't find translation for this よなも anywhere. I have listened to the song as well and to my untrained ear it does sound like よなも (YouTube).The Animelyrics site translates the whole thing as "children of the waltz make ripples on the face of the world" which I believe ignores ウエーブ. On another site it was translated as "children of the waltz name it Uebu" which makes use of ウエーブ and I believe translates よなも as name (名？), however the same word appears in the 5th line and there "name" does not make sense.I know that sometimes poetry and songs deviate from standard language so it might be the case
in a manga I was reading this expression appeared.It was about a lazy girl, who was thinking about getting herself a boyfriend (so that he can do the house chores for her), and then her friend replies:"そんなホイっと見つかるもんか"From the context I'd just guess the sentence means something like "As if it would be so easy (for you to get a boyfriend)", but it's still bugging me what the "ホイ" here means.It would be nice if someone could tell me! :-)

In 1970, Masahiro Mori proposed the theory of the Uncanny Valley, which states that "when human replicas look and act almost, but not perfectly, like actual human beings, it causes a response of revulsion among human observers."English translations (like the above linked Wikipedia article) depict Mori's Uncanny Valley in graph form as a function of human likeness versus familiarity, which is an odd term to use, as a low familiarity would not be expected to cause revulsion in the common use of the word.In his original article, Mori used the term 親和感. I have translated 親和 to friendship, fellowship according to Denshi Jisjo and 感 seems to mean sense of. However, sense of friendship still doesn't seem like a particularly adequate translation. I am wondering if there are any other interpretations/translations of the term that Mori could have had in mind.
Is there any difference in meaning between the words じょうご and ろうと, both meaning something like "funnel", both written with the kanji 漏斗There's some indication in the answers here that ろうと may be a specific term used when you're talking about scientific experiments, but no such distinction in the dictionaries I have access to.How about in compounds For example, 漏斗雲{ろうとうん} - is it always ろうと in these cases
This is a section of text from my JLPT textbook on page 33:電話を前にして、彼女に僕の恋心を告げるべきがどうか非常に心が揺れていた。昔の僕だったら、ためらいもせず告白しただろうに。今日ほど断られることが怖いと思うことはない。電話番号を聞く勇気はあったじゃないか、軽く映画にでも誘えばいいじゃないか、と言い聞かせながら、今日もまた時間が過ぎていった。I think (or hope) that I understand it in general, but I can't quite get the very last part.My loose translation would be something like, "Before calling, I'm extremely nervous about telling her that I'm falling for her. Back in the day, I wouldn't hesitate to confess my feelings. Now, it's not the case that I'm afraid she'll reject me. While I ask myself, didn't I have the confidence to get her number, couldn't I just casually ask her out to a movie or something..."And then the last part, 今日もまた時間が過ぎていった, I'm not sure about.Is it, "... and still, it's getting late" As in, the author is not specifying exactly why he is nervous, he's just saying how it's getting late while he waffles about callingIs it, ".... and still, a lot of time has passed until today" As in, it's been a while since the author got her number, and so he's worried she's forgotten about him or something My read on this paragraph is that he has not asked her out yet so this is after his first meeting, and before the first date.Is it something else
Shrimp (えび) is written several different ways in Japanese. For example, there are the words commonly used in Chinese: 蝦 and 鰕. There is also a compound specific to Japan, 海老, and a kokuji, 蛯. Both of the latter contain the character for old age, 老. Is there some reason why the Japanese associate shrimp with old age
The textbook Japanese for busy people 1 tells me, in lesson 6, that "relative time expressions like あした, らいしゅう, こんげつ and きょねん generally do not take any particles."They exemplify this with sentences like:  スミスさんはあしたぎんこうにいきます。  チャンさんはきょねんにほんにきました。  One lesson later, they tell me that "unlike relative time expressions, specific time expressions take the particle に.  どようびに, 'on Saturday'  ２００６ねんに, 'in 2006'"They then provide these example sentences:  ジョンソンさんはらいしゅうのきんようびににほんにきます。  かいぎはすいようびです。However, and contradicting the explanation given, the second example sentence does not take に. Furthermore, they do not provide any example as to why. Is there any rule that explains this When do specific time expression take the に particle, and when don't theyP.S.: I know no kanji, so please provide your answers in kana. Thank you.

I've been working on listening practice again.  This time, I'm watching the first episode of an anime series called スケッチブック 〜full color's〜.In the first episode, a certain character asks three questions, and I think all three end with と.  I recorded them and uploaded an MP3, and I attempted to transcribe them:あっ、空{そら}！　どこいくとー？空、何探しよーと？空、どうしたとー？Here are my questions:Is と a dialect equivalent of using の to mark a questionAm I just hearing と wrong(I'm sorry if the whole transcription is wrong!  I'm not very good at hearing Japanese yet.)

In this answer, Darius Jahandarie says that ないで is a te-form.  I asked about this on chat, and Flaw answered with a question:If auxiliary ください follows after てformand ないでください exists, can we reversely conclude ないで is て formThis makes sense to me, so I think it is a te-form.  But a te-form of what  It doesn't look like the te-form of ない, which I think is /nak-u-te/.Etymology would be helpful here, but I found a comment by Matt saying the etymology of ないで is basically unknown, and another comment by Tsuyoshi Ito pointing to the entry in 大辞林, which seems to agree that there is no established theory for the origin of ないで.So perhaps the best thing to do is to focus on how the word functions and ignore etymology.  Two possibilities come to mind:Perhaps ないで is a word with only one form, and that form happens to be a te-form.Perhaps ないで is considered an alternate te-form for ない, even if that's not what it was etymologically.Do either of these explanations make sense  Is there a better way to explain ないで
I can say 歩いて渡る which translates to "to cross by walking".  However, if I would like to say "I am not going to cross by walking, but by some other means", would I say   歩かないで渡る or 歩いて渡らないThere are many other examples, most of which involve the use of the so-called Japanese auxilary verbs that follow the te-form of the verb they "help" (ある, いる, くれる, あげる, もらう, 行く, 来る, etc).  I don't like this term because I view them as just normal verbs.Another example would be 食べている.To say that "(I) am not eating", it would be 食べていない instead of the morelogical structure 食べないでいる, which would, at least in my opinion, nicely and logically translate to "I am not in the state of eating". This is because the verb that needs the negation is the verb 食べる, not the verb いる.Explanations from linguistic points of view are also welcome. I hate to treat this kind of verbs as auxiliary verbs. They are just verbs chained together using serial verb construction, which exists in a number of East Asian languages (Korean, Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, etc), and at least in my first language, I would treat them as normal verbs chained together to indicate: (1) a sequence of actions happening one after another(2) a set of actions happening simultaneously as in 歩いて渡る and 食べている(3) cause-effect (4) method as in 歩いて渡るSo the concept is pretty much the same, except for the fact that in Japanese these verbs are "special" when it comes to negation.
I think all of the mentioned verbs are in the same class, because they all inflect irregularly in the same way: -aimasu for the polite form rather than -arimasu.My question is how these verbs were formed. My guess is there is some base verb which was connected to aru and then underwent some sort of devoicing and 音便.For example, does くださる originate from 下す + 在るIf this guess is correct, does this 在る have some semantic meaning (There seems to be a large chance that it's used to make things more polite, since these are all 敬語.)
This morning I was thinking about the joke "There are only 10 types of people in the world: those who understand binary, and those who don't".  Considering if this would translate well to Japanese, I figured it would have to use 十 to represent the 10.  But 十 represents the actual value of 10, not just the digits '1' and '0' juxtaposed.  However, if you wrote it as just 一〇 (or possibly 一零), it (almost) completely ruins the joke.So does Japanese mathematics even write numeric notation using kanji  If so, how are radices greater than 10 handled  Because traditionally, the symbols used are letters, starting with A=10, B=11, and so on.  Presumably Japan had mathematicians long before encountering (Latin) letters, so how did they represent the &gt;10 valuesRealize this may be too localized and not generally helpful.  Close if necessary.
When should one use 聴く instead of 聞く Is there a precise rule for which one to use in which situationI have a feeling that 聞 is used more when the source of the sound is a person or other living being, whereas 聴 is reserved for when the source of the sound is a inanimate object. Am I correctWhat about 訊く
I decided to read about the words for Ginkgo in Japanese (as in Ginkgo biloba).I was surprised to learn that Ginkgo comes from Japanese!  According toWikipedia, Engelbert Kaempfer, while writing the Amoenitatum exoticarum, read the kanji 銀杏 as ぎんきょう.  He romanized this reading as Ginkjo, which was then unfortunately misprinted as Ginkgo, resulting in the spelling used in many Western languages today.From the same article, I see that イチョウ is a common word for Ginkgo plants, apparently from the Chinese 鴨脚.  It seems that this word was assigned to the kanji 銀杏 as a jukujikun reading, and we can see that both readings existed 300 years ago, because Kaempfer also transcribed イチョウ (as Itsjo).In fact, 銀杏 has a third reading, ぎんなん.  Similar to ぎんきょう, it appears that this reading was made by putting two on'yomi together: ぎん＋あん＝ぎんあん→ぎんなん.  But here's what makes me curious about the difference between the readings: 大辞林 and 大辞泉 only list ぎんなん, not ぎんきょう.  And 300 years ago, Kaempfer only transcribed ぎんきょう, not ぎんなん.It seems that both ぎんきょう and ぎんなん mean the same thing (Ginkgo plants or seeds).  But what is the relationship between the two readingsDid ぎんなん replace ぎんきょう, making the latter obsoleteOr are both readings still used
In my JLPT textbook, 日本語総まとめＮ１読解, on page17, there are these two sentences (which are both part of a larger paragraph, but I hope I have included enough):自分{じぶん}なんかにできるわけがないとあきらめる態度{たいど}ほどじれったいものはないそれ以上{いじょう}は望{のぞ}まないというような考{かんが}えの人{ひと}が少{すく}なからずいるのは残念{ざんねん}でならないA translation for the first sentence is offered in the book, which is, "it is very frustrating to see people giving up on things even before they start." There is no translation given for the second sentence, but it is clear from the lesson it is being offered in that it is saying something like, "it's disappointing that it's no small number of people that think they won't hope for more."Both sentences seem to be asserting something. That it is frustrating that people give up on things and that the number of people who don't hope is too many.But when I read the sentences, they seem to me to be negating those premises because they end with ものはない and でならない. My reading of them is "it isn't very frustrating to see people giving up on things even before they start," and, "it's not disappointing that it's no small number of people that think they won't hope for more."Me and the book disagree on whether these sentences are positive or negatve assertions, but I assume it's me that is mistaken somehow.How is it that these sentences are not negative, in spite of ものはない and でならない
I was looking in A Dictionary of Basic Japanese Grammar when I saw something on page 329 which truly shocked me:"node cannot be used and kara must be used [... when ...] the main clause is a command, request, suggestion or invitation"×　この映画はためになるので行きなさい  ○　この映画はためになるから行きなさい×　あしたのショーはおもしろいのでぜひ見に来て下さい  ○　あしたのショーはおもしろいからぜひ見に来て下さい×　この本はとてもおもしろいのでみんなも読んだほうがいいよ  ○　この本はとてもおもしろいからみんなも読んだほうがいいよ×　いい酒をもらったので一緒に飲みましょうか  ○　いい酒をもらったから一緒に飲みましょうかI do not consider the × sentences ungrammatical at all!I, on the other hand, consider ので more polite than から, and would hesitate to use から in 丁寧語 sentences (except where only から is an option, e.g. からです, でしょうから). So I actually prefer the × sentences in the second and fourth examples.What is going on Is the dictionary wrong, am I wrong, or has the distinction between the two particles shifted in nuance (The dictionary was written in 1986).
Wikipedia claims that Japanese verbs are a closed class and that loanwords from Chinese always use する. 信じる, 感じる seems to be an exception. Why aren't they 信をする and 感をする Maybe because one kanji is too shortAlso, what is the origin of the ending じる used with these two borrowed verbs
There seems to be many Japanese verbs that are mysteriously compounded with 出る, like 出来る and 出会う. What is the actual semantic role of the 出 I'm especially curious about the difference between 会う and 出会う.
This question already has answers here:                                            The various ways of saying “all”                                (2 answers)                            Closed 7 years ago.Title basically says it all. I think meanings are very close. Are they interchangeable Are they appropriate for different contexts or situations Can one be applied to animate objects and other can't So far I can't figure out when to use one over the other. Thank you.
This particular 四字熟語 is exactly the same as the proverb in English, "kill two birds with one stone." I find it to be a strange coincidence that both would have this phrase independently of each other, unless killing birds by throwing stones was just a really big thing back then. Did the Japanese copy the English Did the English copy the Japanese Did they both copy some Chinese proverb or something, or did it come from somewhere else entirely Etymologically speaking where did 一石二鳥 come from
Clearly I'm still struggling with the use of ばかを見る, which I have asked about before.This sentence appears in a question in my JLPT textbook:正直者{しょうじきもの}がばかをみない 社会{しゃかい}であるべきだ。Based on the help in that other question, I think my understanding of the sentence is close, but I'm not 100% sure.Two ways I can translate this are, "It's desirable for a society to not fool honest people," or, "It's desirable for a society to not have honest people look foolish".Is either of those right Is it something else
I have this sentence in my JLPT textbook:話{はなし}の種{たね}に、新{あたら}しくできたレストランに食{た}べに行{い}ってみた。I think I understand the part after the comma, which I believe is saying, "... tried to go eat at the new restaraunt."But I have a hard time connecting it with the part before the comma, 話{はなし}の種{たね}に. 話{はなし}の種{たね} is, as far as I understand it, a "topic of conversation."Does it mean something like, "We went to go eat at the new restaraunt to have a conversation" Or maybe, "we talked about going to eat at the new restaurant"What does this sentence mean, and how does it come together
This sentence is in my JLPT textbook:つい舌{した}がすべってしまい、うそがばれてしまった。I thought that it meant something like, "with an unintentional slip of the tongue, my lie was exposed." However, the sentence is marked as being an incorrect usage of すべる, and it doesn't explain why.I know that one can say つい口{くち}がすべる, which in English I would equate with "a slip of the tongue," to accidentally say something one didn't intend to say.In Japanese, is it only mouths that slip, not tongues(A helpful answer would not only confirm this with a yes or no, but ideally offer a little insight on how 口{くち} and 舌{した} differ in metaphorical terms.)
I'm trying to come up with a good synonymous expression to put on a flashcard for 「〜のに」at the end of a sentence like these彼が出て行けばいいのに。(I wish he would go.)あの建物さえなければ、きれいな景色が見えるのに。(If it wasn't for this building, we could see a beautiful scenery.)欲しいといえば、買ってあげたのに。(If you had told me, I would have bought it for you.)ああ、せっかく学校が休みなのになあ。(Ahh, just as school is closed for vacation [I have to study for an entrance exam (or similar)])I would probably translate 「〜のに」 with wish, should etc.My dictionary explains that it is used to express dissatisfaction, irritation and similar feelings. I'm wondering what Japanese expressions I should use if I were to rephrase the sentences above without 「のに」. Would any of the following be correct and/or appropriate What else〜という希望がある〜べき・はずだ
あの野郎、どんだけジークさんに恩を受けたと思っていやがるんだ！In this sentence, does に mean the same thing as から Thank you very much for help!
If I am reading a Chinese text to a Japanese audience, how can I know which reading to use for each character Of the 音読み, there can be 呉音, 漢音, and 唐音 to choose from. Also for pronunciation, would rhythm be modified to stress individual characters in deference to their monosyllabic origin in Chinese speech (I am a beginner and have no background on this topic.) For example if I was trying to impress a Japanese Buddhist scholar by reciting the ｢般若心経」, a classical Buddhist text written in Chinese, how would I pick the readings for the first sentence: 「観自在菩薩行深般若波羅蜜多時、照見五蘊皆空、度一切苦厄。」 As far as I know there is no Japanese translation with words rearranged and inserted. This is probably not a useful skill since I doubt I will ever find another person interested in hearing me recite classical Chinese literature in Japanese. In fact, I could probably just pick readings as I choose for mnemonic purposes only, but I was curious if there is a set of 'correct' readings.

In 部, the right side radical is called the large village radical.For 陪, the left side radical is called the small village radical.Why are their names different on different sides even though both are 阝
Is there one  One of my dictionaries lists them as欲{ほっ}する　→　to desire/to want欲しがる　→　to desire/to want/to wish for/to covetOnly the latter sounds like it includes more "bad"/selfish desires (covet).  However, in this verse in the Bible, they both appear, and both talk about "bad"/selfishly desiring something.あなたの隣人の妻を欲{ほっ}してはならない。隣人の家、畑、男女の奴隷、牛、ろばなど、隣人のものを一切欲しがってはならない。　―　 申命記 / 5章 21節So all they really different at allAlso, as a side question, is 欲する ever read as よくする  I see it listed here, and it comes up in my Android Google Japanese IME, but the dictionary only has an entry for ほっする.
When referring to a room (in a building), what is the difference in usage, if anyI looked up the definitions and checked some sample phrases, but I could not see any real difference.I usually read or use 部屋, but I came across this term [一室]{いっしつ} meaning "one room". So I am wondering what the difference is.
Tell me please in the sentence below, can うちは means the same as うちに Or it's just うち like "we"  Thank you very much for help!
I have come across two sentences in a manga that is using くん in a way that I can't seem to find any information on, in both my books and online. I am guessing this may be some sort of slang, odd grammar or a compound of words/grammar that dictionaries don't seem to pick up on. 「おめーはちょくちょくうちの晩飯　食いにくんなー」and「てゆーか　なんで連れてくんだ？」Slight edit: maybe this is some form of 来る？
I have been reading the PHP manual in both Japanese and English and have reached the part about operators.In the 代数演算子 section they talk about 加算, 減算 etc, and have a table showing all of the 代数演算子 (you can see it here: http://www.php.net/manual/ja/language.operators.arithmetic.php)In the Japanese version of the manual they describe -$a as 負にする but in the English version they use the word Negation.I wondered if there was a noun in Japanese to describe this, like there is 加算 to describe Addition.Since they use the word Negation in the English version I thought maybe 否定 in Japanese, but I'm not sure, so if any one knows of a noun to describe this concept any help would be appreciated.
Because I am a programmer, I have been reading tutorials and manuals about programming in Japanese.For the most part I am ok with all of the terminology, both from the computing side and maths side.However I have just been reading about the Modulo Operator (剰余演算子) and have no idea how to read in in a formula.For example 加算 means Addition, but you would read the 加算演算子 as 足す in a formula like 1 + 2 = 3.I know that 剰余 means Remainder (or modulus), but I doubt you would say that when reaidng a formula.All I can think of for example is:4 % 2 = 0よん　モジュロ　に　は　れい/ゼロAny help would be appreciated.
I was just wondering what the essential differences are between these and how I would use them in everyday speech.  Thank you.
Our teacher taught us to ask for the permission to ask a question by saying「質問してもいいですか。」. Now I'm writing her an email, and would like to say something along the lines of "If I may ask a question, ...", where (...) would be a grammar question, for example.I would have written 「質問してもよかったら、……」, but Google returns no hits at all for this specific sentence, so obviously it's not correct.How would you say "If I may ask a question, ..."
たとえば looks like it should be the ば form of a verb, but is that true I know of the word 例える, but the ば form of this would be 例えれば. The phrase 例えるなら also exists, which would be a cousin if it were really based on some ば form. It's really hard to search for information about this because たとえば is ubiquitous in its use. Grammatically it seems that ば verbs could be used in this way with no problem, so everything in my mind tells me that this is the case. But ultimately I have no real proof of that.Is たとえば based on a ば verb etymologically, or did it come about by some other mechanism Is there a たとう from which it originally cameNote: This question originally suggested for some reason that there was no verb "たとう," a statement that turned out to be completely false.
I have found this in a phone usage manual (電話対応マニュアル) written by a Japanese person:かしこまりました。必ず田中に申し伝えます。それでは失礼いたします。(speaking to customer over the phone) Understood. I will tell Tanaka (my colleague). Goodbye.What do you think about the use of 申し伝える hereIt feels unnatural to use humble language (謙譲語) when referring to Tanaka, who is within my company.Does it depend on Tanaka's position relative to meIs there anything better I could use instead
Tell me please, what から means in his sentence  If I'm guessing corrctly it would translate something like "She fall on her face really hard", but still... would ”顔面に全力で” be incorrect hereSentence: コケていた。恐らくは・・・・・・顔面から全力で。Thanks you very much for your help.
I am wondering if there is a way to describe this concept in Japanese, or an equivalent phrase.  According to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_of_faith it is a mostly western concept (if you believe wikipedia anyway).  I am asking in relation to the definition in the first paragraph, not in the religious sense.  This phrase relates to “deciding whether to make (or being forced to make) a choice that goes against ones most basic beliefs. And in the process, either retain that belief, or drop it in favor of another one. It is this situation that causes the internal conflict.  I do not believe it is directly related to simple inability to make a decision, not knowing what to believe, nor the process of self-discovery in general.”
My JLPT book has this question:ドライブの前{まえ}に（a.まともに b.念入{ねんい}りに）車{くるま}の点検{てんけん}をした。I chose a, thinking that a reasonable translation was, "Before driving, do a proper check of the car."The answer turns out to be b, which I guess means, "Before driving, do a careful check of the car."I suspect that part of the problem is that my English definitions for "proper" and "careful" are close enough that I'm translating まともに and 念入{ねんい}りに too closely.Even still, the two words are pretty similar. What differentiates まともに and 念入{ねんい}りに that should make b the clear choice in this question
My JLPT textbook gives me this example sentence to explain the meaning of 凝{こ}る:釣{つ}りに凝{こ}るThe book provides a translation, which is, "be absorbed in fishing."Later, in a test question, there is this sentence:あの建物{たてもの}はかなりこった造{つく}りをしている(The question in the book does not use the kanji for 凝{こ}る.)This really confused me until I looked in a dictionary and saw that 凝{こ}った can also be defined as "elaborate, refined, artistic."I notice, when I use Rikaichan to double check the definitions as I write this, that the "artistic" definition only comes up for the こった form of the word, and the "be absorbed in" definition comes up for the こる form of the word.I don't understand how I was supposed to get the meaning in the question from the meaning in the example. Perhaps the book just made a mistake Or maybe there's some other way of looking at this that I'm just not seeing. The varying forms of the verb and the use of hiragana versus kanji is confusing me to the point where I can't sort it all out.What is the relationship between the meanings, the kanji versus hiragana use, and the two forms of the word
I have this phrase in my JLPT textbook:私{わたし}の上司{じょうし}は気{き}さくで近寄{ちかよ}りがたいMy translation, which must be incorrect in some way, is, "my superior is hard to approach as he/she is friendly." It seems to me that で implies some kind of connection or causality. It's not that the superior is friendly and hard to approach, there is something about their friendliness that results in how it's hard to approach them.I'm reasonably sure about the definitions of individual words, but it seems to end up as an illogical assertion. How can someone who is friendly be hard to approachWhat am I not understanding about this sentence
I don't get the difference in meaning between には and にしたら like in this sentence from my textbook:大きすぎる親の期待は、子供にしたら苦痛だ。  Expectations of parents that are too big become agony for the children.Is it possible to exchange にしたら in above sentence with には If yes, how would you distinguish the meaning between these grammatical functions or when to use にしたら or には, respectivelyTo me they seem to be fully interchangeable.
Can someone tell me what ように means in this phraseあの人にそんな秘密があるようには全く見えないがな。
In the JLU chat, Flaw recently typed up some instructions printed on a Japanese product.  Here's what they said:直射日光の当たらない涼しい所に保管してくださいIt appears that 所 is modified by two phrases:直射日光の当たらない "not in direct sunlight"涼しい "cool"But they aren't joined by て.  It doesn't say 直射日光の当たらなくて涼しい.  I can't find any information on joining two adjectives like this, without using て.  Is it grammatical to combine them this way  Is it different from using てI've seen forms like すごい高い before, but I thought that was just a non-standard way of saying すごく高い.  This seems like it's different.
What is the meaning of あくまで in the sentence あくまで私個人の意見です ALC: back and edge, consistentlyGJiten: to the end; to the bitter end; to the last; stubbornly; persistently; to the utmostWhat nuance is added, compared to saying just 私個人の意見です Is it more humble (it's only my opinion)  Does it express a more persistent opinion
Are the two used completely interchangeably or are there specific situations where one might be used more than the other For example I've never heard 日本語 said にっぽんご.
I recently learned 青色をしている as a synonym for 青い, but I don't have a good idea of what the difference is, or even if there's any difference at all. On chat, Flaw suggested the difference might be intrinsic quality (〜をしている） versus incidental quality (青い）, but I don't have a good idea of what that means.  I found a forum thread suggesting something similar, but I came away from that a bit confused--one poster claimed it was intrinsic versus extrinsic but didn't explain what that meant, and another said there is no difference in most cases.So my question is: what is the difference between 青い and 青色をしている
WWWJDIC says that both 迷宮 and 迷路 mean "maze / labyrinth".Google Images suggests that they are about the same thing: link1, link2However, what may be the differences in nuance and usage between 迷宮 and 迷路
In Japanese, the particle で seems to have multiple uses:Instrumental: 車{くるま}で大阪{おおさか}に行{い}った。 "I went to Osaka by car."Locative: 図書館{としょかん}で数学{すうがく}を勉強{べんきょう}している。 "I'm studying math in the library."て-form of copula: 水{みず}はきれいで静{しず}かだ。 "The water is pretty and calm."て-form of copula (sentence conjunction): 彼{かれ}は来{く}るので、大丈夫{だいじょうぶ}だ。 "He's coming, so it'll be fine."連用形{れんようけい} of copula: そうではない。 "That's not how it is."(It may be possible to analyze #4 as a 連用形, in the 中止形{ちゅうしけい} sense, but I don't think that's what is in modern usage, since there is an implication of temporal order.)What is the origin of these uses Do all these でs historically come from one thing(I've heard that "で came from にて", but that doesn't really explain much for me in terms of how all these forms came about and if they are really all from the same original thing.)

I can't really understand why sometimes い adjectives are transformed to nouns instead of just being used themselves.I.E.  白い鳥 has 300,000 google hits while 白の鳥 has 4 million.  近い家　has 113,000 google hits while 近くの家 has 150 millionI tried searching but I didn't really find any explanations for this.Is it just a matter of knowing the correct form to use or is there a meaning difference which makes one use popular and the other not
when i was reading Rosario+vampire s2  manga i read this sentence''血液を媒介にしてのみ真祖は継承されるの”血液＝blood媒介＝Intermediaryのみ＝Only真祖＝term in the manga indicates vampires ancestors継承＝Inheritancethen what does ''媒介にして" mean  its not ''媒介する” right and is "継承される" the passive form of "継承する”
This is a follow up to How to construct potential form for adjectivesI'd like to know how to say "can be x" where x is an adjective, in a casual way. For example with a friend, this seems a little stiff: "敬語凄い長い可能性があるね。” ("Keigo can be really long.")  Isn't there a casual term more relevant for this situation かもしれない doesn't seem relevant as I'm not expressing doubt.

This question comes from observing a game show called ガキの使いやあらへんで ("instant miso soup" episode), where the participants have to match a product to the one they consume while blindfolded. They are only allowed to try one product at a time from the pool of products, and they have to declare whether it is, or is not the same as the one given to them initially before being allowed to try another one.When he declares "is not" (at 6:05), ではございません is used.When he declares "is" (at 9:07), です is used.(The other participants also similarly use ではございません and です)By symmetry, I expected でございます to be used for "is". The symmetry I have in mind is:ではございません ← ではありません ← ではない = だ → です・であります → でございますIt seems incongruent to me, that is to say that the use of ではございません implies the use of でございます but です is used instead.Why is です used instead of でございます as expected from the above symmetryOr if I may ask from the other direction, why ではございません instead of ではありません My conclusion is that either my symmetry is flawed, or the social context of "declaring is" and "declaring is not" is different enough so we cannot compare using symmetry.
Could someone let me know the meaning of the kanji 摑 that is the first character in this phrase It's in a dialog from a movie scenario. It doesn't seem to be a 常用漢字 as far as I can tell.
It's been something I've been thinking about for a while, but could never answer in a more concrete way. This is most apparent when I compare the functions of 何 and どう. I know that 何, どう and どんな are great basic building blocks, but I'm not sure about what each implies when used to ask a question. Does anyone know
I am aware that animal names are generally written in katakana (although sometimes hiragana), but kanji is sometimes used. I stumbled upon the Japanese word クラゲ, meaning jellyfish. The dictionary said that there were two different kanji combinations for the word: 海月 and 水母, both pronounced as クラゲ. The first means 'sea moon', and the other, 'water mother' (possibly 'aquatic mother'). What is the difference between the two and are they interchangeable If not, which is more appropriate if either at all. Any dive into nuance (Why strange words like moon and mother were used) could be useful.
What does the grammar form of 知るin the below sentence mean 闇の世界とは関わるはずがないと知っとったんだろうなThe sentence is from the Japanese version of Harry Potter I
As explained in this question on the English site, there is a distinction in English between saying "How did you know" and "How do you know"When someone makes an assertion, the distinction between "how did you know" and "how do you know" seems to be that "how did you know" implies that the person in question is correct in their assertion. "How do you know" is normally an inquiry into the person's credentials, and often expresses that the assertion is incorrect and/or ungrounded.How would you say these expressions in Japanese, and is the distinction made by tense, as it is in English That is, are they "どうして知っていましたか。" and "どうして知っていますか。"
I tweet in Japanese every once in awhile, sometimes to Japanese people and sometimes to all of my followers.I haven't really been able to figure it out, so how does politeness work on Twitter Some people tweet in 丁寧語{ていねいご}, others don't. Wouldn't it be rude to not use 丁寧語 when many of your followers could be older / socially higherAlso, I've encountered this weird phenomena that when I tweet to someone in 丁寧語 they tend to respond without it, but if I tweet to someone with no 丁寧語 they tend to respond with it. Is this because I'm somehow establishing the respect hierarchy with my initial tweet in the conversation, or because I just really suck at this and always pick the wrong thing to useI'm aware there's not really an established rule for politeness on the internet, but if there are any guidelines or ideas I could keep in mind, that'd be pretty nice to hear.
For example, consider the following sentences:ドアを押し開ける。 I pushed the door open.  ドアを引き開ける。 I pulled the door open.Can you do the same for 閉める So for example:ドアを押し閉める。 I pushed the door shut.  ドアを引き閉める。 I pulled the door shut.I ask this because the first two appear in the dictionary, while the second two do not.
I was looking through example sentences in wwwjdic ( http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/cgi-bin/wwwjdic.cgi11 ) and noticed it uses these, however from looking at the examples, I don't know which one to use when, can I get some clarification on this pleaseExamples:彼女は身をかがめて小石を拾い上げたShe stooped to pick up a pebble.私はペンを拾うと身をかがめたI bent over to pick up the pen.
I know they're both polite ways to use a verb, but my materials never taught me what unique traits each one has. Is it just the tone, or is there more to it

This question already has answers here:                                            全然 {ぜんぜん} with positive adjective / na-adjective                                (3 answers)                            Closed 6 years ago.So far, I know that in proper speech, 全然 should be used with negative verbs such as 全然出来ません or in expressions such as 全然だめ or 全然違う. I am curious about the second type of usage. In that case, 全然 is used with a positive verb that has a negative meaning or pejorative meaning. Is this a generally acceptable usage of the word, for example in these expressions that I just made up:全然悪い(extremely bad),  全然無駄(totally useless), or 全然絶望(total despair).I have never heard 全然 being used like this other than with だめ/違う so I was curious whether these are acceptable or not. Would they fall under slang usage for example as discussed in:全然 {ぜんぜん} with positive adjective / na-adjective
While translating a song, I've stumbled upon the following sentence:落ちた希望を拾って明日に繋いでゆけばWhich got me wondering what the difference between the following two is:落ちた希望を拾って明日に繋いでゆけば落ちた希望を拾って明日に繋げばI have a feeling that the first sentence includes a sense of "doing continually from now" based on what I've read earlier, but I am rather unsure.Is there a possible meaning which  I'm missing
It's difficult to tell what is being asked here. This question is ambiguous, vague, incomplete, overly broad, or rhetorical and   cannot be reasonably answered in its current form.

I know of a few, like から and ので, but does anyone have insight to offer, in this respect
I ask here my question because I couldn't find anything on internet.My problem is about 〜くて form for a verb.I asked a Japanese friend what for example "会いたくて" means.She told me that there is a complicated nuance behind that...It meansI want to meet you (but I can't)I didn't have the opportunity to ask again so I ask here. Could someone explain to me the usage of 〜くて I'm so confused (&gt;_&lt;). Especially with the form which expresses the desire like "食べたい" → "食べたくて".
For example I want to say "I ran 5km in 23mins 59 secs" or "It took me 23mins 59 secs to run 5k" or "It took me an hour to tidy my room" etc etc etc.
I often see words in sentences written in カタカナ or 漢字 that could be swapped for a common word of the other form.  I am aware that there are lots of カタカナ words that do have a 漢字 form, but where the 漢字 form is not commonly used.I was looking up how to translate the word "tattoo" and found that both 「タトゥー」 and 「入れ墨・刺青」seem to be used interchangeably.「タトゥーといっても本当に刺青ではなく、簡単に貼って落とせる水転写シールです。」 I'm sure there are better examples then my tattoo one, but you get the idea.Is there a rule/method for deciding which form to use  Maybe level of politeness/familiarity with the other person, or medium of communication would lead to the decision (I found both What determines whether a word gets a kanji compound or katakana and When writing for general public, is there a general guideline for selecting kanji questions very informative, but I don't feel they addresses this facet of the kanji/katakana choice relationship)
I've stumbled upon these 3 words. I think meaning of 招待 is:invite (as in a formal invitation)The other two seem rather confusing to me, though.
Background: A few months back, I started making the transition from studying sentence constructions to studying grammar. While I try to avoid generating 'Japanese translations of my English ideas,' I still find that I use the way I speak English as a starting point for constructing a Japanese sentence that doesn't quite fit anything I've yet heard (or said).So, with that in mind...Let's say, for the sake of example, that I'm hanging out with a couple friends at a pet store in Japan. (Apologies in advance for everything about this scenario...in particular if it sounds like a screenplay written by a five year old.) ^.^;One friend states:「猫が好きよ。」The other friend turns to me and says:「あなたは？」I then start thinking of a way to express the idea that, in English, I might say as:"Like our friend here, I am also fond of cats."The problem that arises is that I don't know of a word, be it particle or not, that conveys the 'comparative' nature of the first piece, "Like our friend here..."So, improvising a bit, I say:「友達ほど、私も好き。」My limited exposure to ほど has come in the form of constructions about "He has as much bread as she does" and the like. Still, the 'as much as' interpretation of ほど seems like it might fit.  (Maybe. ^.^;)I should also point out that I'm specifically trying to make a comparison between speaker (that is, myself) and a third-party, as opposed to speaker and listener (where I'd imagine 「私も」 would be all the comparison I'd need).So then, my (multi-part but hopefully rhetorically homogeneous) question is, after using ほど in this context, will the native speakers hear an idea analogous to the English-language statement that I mentioned above In other words, does ほど work at all in this context If not, is there another word or particle that would work (Note that I came across ぐらい as well while I was looking into this, and it seems like a possible contender...but I'm not at all acquainted with that word yet.)And if not...is the "Like our friend..." phrase even something that would appear in Japanese (By the way, the 'our' in that phrase is expendable. I only expected the 友達 from that phrase to survive translation.) Or is this a case of my trying to shoehorn English communication into the Japanese language
From "Japanese for Busy People Level II" p 46, there is the following question:Fill in the blank with the appropriate particle:この　くつを　（　　　）みても　いいですか。（はきます）In other words, modify はきます so that the sentence makes sense when the modified word fills the blank.This book is slowly introducing kanji, so you can see there are none here.I know:このくつ　mean these shoes.はきます mean to put on.いいですか。 is asking permission whether it is okay.If the みても were not there, I think the sentence would make sense if te-form (はいて) filled the blank. But the みても is really confusing me. I really don't know what it means! I suppose it's just te-form みます (to look). But, I have no idea what it's doing in this sentence. Also, the particle も doesn't make sense to me.I did learn something recently, which may or may not be related, even though it's not exactly helping me here... That is, using a te-form verb followed by みます, means "to try to do that verb." But in this sentence, it seems opposite. In other words, if I'm not mistaken, one could say, "～をはいてみますいいですか。" Which would mean, "is it okay if I try to put these on" I could easily be mistaken, especially with particles.Sorry to ramble, but I'm just trying to explain my current level of understanding.Thank you for reading.
I mean I understand all the parts separately but I can't lay my finger on the core meaning of the sentence.Whole message: Hi I'm maho !  17years old, from Japan.  your Japanese is good !  my English is poor.  日本語で送っても読めますか？  I want to be your pen pal.    Good bye
I am trying to express something akin to these sentences:Even with a spoon, he digs well (でも)Even without a shovel, he digs wellI would also like to express this:With a shovel as well, he digs well [implying he digs great with a lot of tools]How would one go about thisI can see how my example sentences might not be best example, but what I'm basically wondering is whether adding でも or も　to the particle で is possible, as it with, for example, にででも does sound rather silly to me.
I would like to know if someone can help me with the word あらそう. Dictionaries online translate it like "to compete" or "to oppose", but in the context of the whole sentence, this definition makes no sense at all. The whole sentence is this: 今のアイオリアは  教皇に洗脳された  たんなる戦闘マシーン  黄金聖闘士の中でも  一二をあらそう  アイオリアが  悪鬼のごとくせめれば  青銅聖闘士など  ひとたまりもない  今頃ズタズタにされた  星矢の死体が  ころがっているはずだIf I'm not wrong, the translation should be something like this: "Aiolia, now that he was brainwashed by the Pope, is nothing but a fight machine. Aiolia "あらそう" among the 12 Gold Saints, if he attacks like a demon, a Bronze Saint has no chances, the corpse of Seiya should be lying in the floor by now...".But as I said, I can't find a decent translation for "あらそう".  Does anyone have any ideaThanks in advance.

Is a plain ~違います appropriate in this context
I could not find any examples of this usage, but what I'm basically asking is whether or not this is possible:怒るより悲しいですよRather than being mad, I am sadIs this a legitimate way of using より
I was trying to express the idea of "Like + do something", as in "I like to drink tea" or "I like to eat pasta".After a quick search I found that you can express it like this, omitting the parts to drink/to eat:1a. (私は)パスタが好きです。2a. (私は)お茶が好きです。But couldn't this be seen simply as "I like tea/pasta" While being more or less the same meaning, it doesn't have the same nuance.And if I wanted to make it clearer, would they be something like this1b. (私は)パスタを食べる好きです。2b. (私は)お茶を飲む好きです。I've used numbers and letters so it's easier to refer to the single sentences.
These are two words that seem like they are basically interchangeable at most levels, as they generally are. The difference between them appears to be small, but what is the difference, if one exists I feel like there are certain situations in which you would use 大事 and certain situations in which you would use 大切. For example, I would associate 大切 with sentimental things because of the 切 in it that comes from 切ない, things like memories, or a present that someone gave you, whereas I would associate 大事 with things that are of pressing importance, closer to 重要. But this does not appear to be the case, as I occasionally see 大切 used where I would normally expect 大事, like 大切なお知らせ, with more of a feeling of 緊急 or urgency. There are sources here and here which address this, but they both arrive at the same wiggly uncertain feeling that 大切 is more emotional and 大事 is more about urgency while admitting that in just about any situation the two can be used interchangeably.大辞林 isn't much help on the subject. For both it says 重要であるさま, and in 大事 it includes 大切に扱う and in 大切 it includes 大事にする. The only hint I can get from the dictionary entry is in the following for 大切:大切丁寧に扱って、大事にするさま。「本を―にする」「命を―にする」And in the following for 大事:大事重要で欠くことのできないさま。ある物事の存否にかかわるさま。「―な用を忘れていた」「今が―な時期だ」This lends something to the idea of 大切 as a more 'polite' form of importance while 大事 is more about the concept that something is fundamentally necessary and in that regard important. However both of the entries generally seem to be nearly the same with different wording.Is there a practical difference, and if so, what is it Does using one over the other have any impact on the actual meaning of a sentence When can they not be used interchangeably (outside of set phrases like お大事に)
I can't manage to understand the meaning of ものでして.An example using a full sentence could be the following:私はしばらく、隠棲していたものでしてね。まあ怠けているのは今に始まったことでもなし・・・
Every example I see with だれ and a copula has だれ placed at the end (あの方はだれですか。)  Will changing the order to だれがあの方ですか。be acceptable or mean something elseAlso, how do I write "Who has A car"  I want to say だれがくるまがありますか but it looks odd having 2 が　particles.
I'm just wondering if they are the same word or if there is an actual difference (in meaning or nuance). It seems weird to me that there would be two different verbs with the same kanji stem that mean "to imitate".
I recently looked up the word まんまと in 大辞林.  The pitch accent is marked 13.  I don't understand what that means, so I decided to look it up in the explanatory notes, which I'll attempt to summarize here (omitting bits about terminology and such):Words in Japanese are divided into morae which are pronounced either high or lowPitch always changes between the first and second morae大辞林 marks the HLL... pattern with 1大辞林 marks the LHH... pattern with 0大辞林 marks patterns like LHHL with 3 and LHHHL with 4 (indicating the mora directly before the pitch falls)Unfortunately, I still don't understand.  It seems like it should have a single number indicating where the downstep is, or a 0 if there is no downstep, but in this case there are two numbers: 1 and 3.  (I assume it's not thirteen because there are only four morae in this word.)  I don't see any explanation of what it means when there are two numbers like this.So, my question is: what is the pitch accent of まんまと, and how can I understand this 13 notation

I've tried Googling for Japanese/Japanese dictionary definitions of this phrase, but can only find usages so far, which haven't helped.More context:"俺たち職人の腕が光る"I think from context that the speaker is saying "so that us artisans do well / look good / show how good we are", or something in that area, but dictionaries haven't been helpful so far - hoping Japanese StackExchange can solve the riddle! Thanks.

In the manga らんま 1/2, a character from China says the following:気{き}をつけるよろし、ムースは[暗器]{かくし武器}の[達人]{たつじん}よ。My question is about [暗器]{かくし武器}.  The ruby is just as I've typed it, with two tiny kanji included.  As I understand it, ruby text usually gives readings in kana (furigana), but this seems like something else!  If it were actually pronounced that way, wouldn't the author have written it かくし[武器]{ぶき}  I don't know how to interpret it.My guess is that the character is pronouncing 暗器 either in Chinese or as あんき and that かくし武器 tells the reader what 暗器 means rather than how it's pronounced.  Am I on the right track
The only example I can think of/that I know of at the moment that has ever been of controversy with regard to sexism in Japanese was the change from 看護婦 to 看護師. I'm sure there are probably many more cases like this. I also see a lot of words with kanji that seem more or less degrading to women, but I'm not sure that this is what I'm going for with the question. Rather I'm looking for something more ingrained, more structural that has been a source of controversy in the past. Vocabulary or kanji could fall into this category as well, but I'm not looking for an exhaustive listing of words or expressions that could be considered sexist. Rather I want to know what is and has been considered sexist in Japanese by Japanese people.As an example in English there is notably no gender neutral third person pronoun, so words like "man" and "he" are the norm while other more equal words either don't exist or aren't used as widely in situations where gendered speech has been traditionally used.Does Japanese have these kinds of issues, and if so what are they
赤 is generally understood as meaning 'red' (which can explain combinations like 赤子 (red face of a crying baby)). However, I have seen some words with 赤 that have a negative meaning, 赤 possibly increasing this connotation. 赤裸裸 (blunt, frankness (赤裸 being nudity in Chinese)), 赤貧 meaning extreme poverty, 赤口 (赤日) being one of the unlucky days in Rokuyo (lucky and unlucky weekdays in simple), meaning 'Evil day'. Why does 赤 appear in such morbid and negative words Is 赤 simply 当て字 or does it have any meaning or semantic reason for being in words like these Is it 虫 where the common understanding of the word (in the case of 虫 it would be 'bug') has a connection to the negative meaning, if this is the same for 赤 then how is it connected to the negative meaning
I'm reading about this grammar in my book but I don't get it. According to the book it means - そうだ　and - らしい.

My Japanese textbook only lists じゅっぷん.  Our Japanese sensei (a quite old woman) says じっぷん but notes that it's optionally じゅっぷん. Our TAs all say じゅっぷん.I understand that Middle Chinese 十 was "jip" and the thing went through じふ-&gt;じう-&gt;じゆう-&gt;じゅう, but what about 十分 Clearly じっぷん seems to be the etymologically correct pronunciation, but which one is the more modern-day official and widespread pronunciation (i.e. more commonly used and accepted), rather than simply historically correctEdit: How about １０分 Is the more common pronunciation of １０分 different

A recent question asked about joining two adjectives together.  It used the following example:(example 1) きれいで静かな町As I understand it, this is the combination of the 連用形 of きれいだ with the 連体形 of 静かだ.  Let's turn this example into 終止形 instead of 連体形 for my question:(example 2) 町はきれいで静かだAccording to this answer, you can also join two adjectives with し.  In this case, I would replace で with だ and add し:(example 3) 町はきれいだし静かだ I think this means the same thing as example 2.  (According to sawa's answer here, the て-form has two restrictions, "it implies temporal order" and "volitionality of what is connected must match".  Neither restriction sounds relevant in this case, so I don't think replacing で with だし changes the meaning.)However, what if I were to change it back to 連体形 like in example 1  Can I join two adjectives with し like this:(example 4) きれいだし静かな町I feel like example 4 is wrong because it parses as two separate clauses, like きれいだ plus 静かな町, which doesn't make sense to me.  In contrast, I think example 1 is parsed as きれいで静かな modifying 町, which does make sense to me.Am I correct that you can't join adjectives with し before a noun like in example 4

My studies taught me there's two ways to say each mora in Japanese, with the way you normally talk and when you put a bit more emphasis on a mora, i.e. when someone says なつかしい, the word would be sounded out as na-tsu-ka-SHI-i. I know only one dictionary that shows the way the words are emphasized (the Pocket Kenkyusha Japanese Dictionary), and I feel it uses overly complex terminology to get the point across.  I want to able to put the principles into terms ordinary folks can understand, but every resource I have is either too complicated or tells me that the language doesn't put any emphasis on individual mora, which I know is totally wrong.So, how does pitch accent work in Japanese

What is the meaning of 母を恋はずや in the film titleEdit: the meaning of "恋う" according to the dictionary is "romantic love" as in "koi suru". E.g. http://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/srch/all/%E6%81%8B%E3%81%86/m1u/ says "特定の異性に心ひかれて、その人を思い慕う。また、特別な人物や場所などを強く慕う。恋する。" So my query is partly about the grammar but also why it is 母を恋する. I can't believe it is some kind of incestuous relationship.

I am aware that one can explain that to things happen at the same time using plain non past form + とき:電車に乗るとき転びました。"I fell when I got on the train (I was going through the door when it happened)" I am not quite sure about the following nuance, though : plain past form + とき　means the first action was over when the second happened :電車に乗ったとき転びました。 "I fell when I got on the train (I was already inside the train when it happened)"Would it roughly mean the same thing as :電車に乗った後転びました。"After I got on the train, I fell"Eventually, would it be correct to express that I read a book before I went to sleep using :本を読んだとき寝ました。
In English cultures there is a thin line (that usually isn't crossed) between symbolism (usually used in visual arts) and lingual connotation which is usually used in creative writing, and colour is a large medium for both. Lets take blue for example. In a painting I would use blue to represent eternity, a sort of ongoing feeling; like that of the sky or ocean. In a story or a poem I would use blue to signify depression or solemness. I have looked for something like the Japanese equivalent but I have only found Japanese colour symbolism.Colours are used often to represent ideas and social attitudes, like gold commonly being the iconic colour of Buddhism in older Japanese art, and blue sometimes representing daily life (because indigo dye was very common). However, what I want to know is if colour didn't just serve symbolic use in visual art, but in writing as well. Does Japanese have different lingual connotations for the colours that are separate from the connotation used in symbolism If possible could you give an example and any helpful resourcesEdit: I'm asking if there is any symbolic use of colours in Japanese language, separate from the symbolic use of and meaning derived from colour symbolism in imagery, like in the example with blue written above.

たとえば、おすしを食べてもいいですか？ is for "May I eat sushi".　However I know that ちょっと、食べなくてもいいです。Is not the right phrase because that means: "Well, you don't have to eat (that)."

Some of the wording in Japanese struck me as strange, so I am wondering about whether in fact this quote is a little strange in tone or is this just a normal way of expressing these kind of sentiments牛乳は牛の乳であるが、人間は牛の肉も食ってしまう動物なので、牛にはたいそう世話になっていると言える。Not only do we drink cow's milk, but humans also eat the meat of cows; we could say that we are reliant on cows for our living.I thought the use of 動物 to describe humans as animals was somewhat strange, and wonder if this emphasis needed to be included in the translation to be faithful to the original sentiment.Compare:人間は牛の肉も食ってしまう動物なのでHumans are an animal that consumes the meat of cowsor maybeMankind is just another animal eating the meat of cowsIs the aspect of man being "just another animal" something emphasized in the japanese, or am I reading too much into it
In English I could write, "Birds (various kinds)".  In Japanese could I translate the version using parentheses as something like 鳥類（各種）, or should the language/parentheses be used differentlyI'm not sure what the rules are for round vs square parentheses.
I am working on translating pick list items that appear in a piece of software from English to Japanese.  There is a mix of verbs and nouns on the lists, ex: workplace, attack, wolf, assault, etc...  For the nouns I think it's probably a direct conversion, but for the verbs should they be included in dictionary form, or some other formFor example I was going to use 攻める for attack/assault, but would I use it just like that in a pick list/drop down list/combo box
I was just thinking about how the term 子どもたち seems redundant since ども and たち are both plural markers. Of course you can use just 子 to refer to a child, but how did 子供 (and thus 子供たち) come to be the norm Is the ども in 子供 unrelated etymologicallyI looked here for an answer which is what led to this confusion. I know that the kanji 供 doesn't refer to number, but this is written:「こども」ということばは「こ」＋「ども」という組み合わせでできている。  「ども」は複数を表す接尾辞で「子ら」の「ら」や「子たち」の「たち」と同じ意味である。Is this accurate
In classical Japanese, many uses of 形容詞{けいようし} had あり "embedded" in them, e.g.:熱からず = 「熱し」の連用形＋「あり」の未然形{みぜんけい}＋「ず」熱かりたり = 「熱し」の連用形＋「あり」の連用形{れんようけい}＋「たり」熱かれ = 「熱し」の連用形＋「あり」の命令形{めいれいけい}熱かる人 = 「熱し」の連用形＋「あり」の連体形{れんたいけい}while others did not:熱くす = 「熱し」の連用形＋「す」熱し = 「熱し」の終止形{しゅうしけい}熱き人 = 「熱し」の連体形{れんたいけい}It seems that there is a plain form and an あり form for most of the conjugations:       plain    あり未然形  -ku      -kara連用形  -ku      -kari終止形  -si      missing連体形  -ki      -karu已然形  -kere    -kare命令形  missing  -kareMy question is why certain usages of 形容詞 used the あり version and others didn't. Did the あり have some sort of semantic meaning(The original motivation for this was the question of why the past tense of 形容詞 is かった rather than くた or った or いた, while the て-form is くて.)(P.S., the majority of my experience with classical Japanese is reading about its grammar, not actually reading old poems or stories. I suspect if I had more actual experience I'd be able to understand why あり is required in these places.)
I'm somewhat informed on gendered speech in Japanese, however, I have also heard that age may play a part in which pronouns and sentence ending particles you use and can get away with. For instance, a teenage boy is more likely to get away with using slightly effeminate  language than a grown man would be. What sort of pronouns (私, 俺, 僕, est.) and sentence ending particles (の, か, かしら, わ, よ, ぞ) would a typical elderly male use (In the standard Tokyo dialect)
I have this following sentence:  　横線――ＨＰバーの名で呼ばれる青いそれは、俺の生命の残量を可視化したものだ。There are a few questions I came up with about this sentence:   The first part of the sentence is: 横線――ＨＰバーの名で呼ばれる青いそれ, my question is how can this sentence be parsed How does the long ―― change the meaning/parsing of the sentence    At the end of the sentence, it is written: 可視化したもの.Why is 可視化した used in past form, while according to the context I'd expect a present-form Is this perhaps a grammar subject I just don't know yetAny help is appreciated!
手紙を書きかけたんですが、まだ書いていません。I got started on the letter, but I haven't finished writing it yet.The ending かける indicates that an action has been started but has not been brought to a finish or an end. However in this example I am puzzled by the second half of the sentence.If I break it down literally, this is the way I comprehend it:手紙を書きかけたんですが、I started (but did not finish the letter), but...まだ書いていません。 still am not writing (the letter).Assuming the highlighted translation is correct, what am I misreading in the second half of the sentence I am puzzled by the use of the negative in the second half, as I would have assumed まだ書いています would make more sense to correspond with the desired meaning of the translation. I guess in this example using 書いています would have expressed a completed action, so 書いていません means "not finished writing" rather than "not writing"Let me try making another example:ごはんを作りかけたんですが、まだ作っていません。I started to make food, but I still haven't finished yet.Compare the latter example to this:A 　ごはん作った？B 　まだ作っていません。A 　Did you make foodB　Not yet.(perhaps implying that food preparation has not yet started)If one writes the original sentence in the positive how does the meaning changeWould the following translation be correct手紙を書きかけたんですが、まだ書いています。I got started on the letter, but I'm still writing it.

Since the Joyo kanji are learned by middle school, I assume that as a person goes through high school and university many more beyond the basic 2,000 are picked up. For a typical 30-ish year old person in Tokyo with some university degree, how many kanji would he be able to read Furthermore, how often would he have to look up unknown kanji

In this dictionary I checked, there are two definitions for けれども. I also checked in my Japanese to English printed dictionary and there was only one definition, but in my Japanese to Chinese printed dictionary, there were two definitions as well.Unfortunately, I'm not good in Japanese and I can't read Chinese very well, so I'm unable to find out the difference between the two definitions apart from that one is labelled as a conjunction and the other as a conjunctive particle, in both dictionaries, and that doesn't really explain anything to me.Could someone please give me an explanation of the two けれどもs
I always thought that besides Kanji, one of the most difficult things about Japanese was its immense amount of homophones. For example, 花 (はな), which means flower, and 鼻 (also はな) which means nose. In the sources and books I read, I am simply supposed to tell the difference by context, and this isn't always easy. Let me elaborate:[甘美]{うまみ}の花は赤く見える  [Talking to Umami] Your flower looks red.[甘美]{うまみ}の鼻は赤く見える  [Talking to Umami] Your nose looks red.If I was talking to Umami before that statement and it was clear we were taking about her flower or her nose than yes, I suppose context would help. However, if this was the starting statement, it might not be completely clear.  Hypothetically, if she was sick and bringing me a red flower, she wouldn't know from the context and I would have wasted my time specifying that I was talking about the organ or the plant. Would pitch be helpful or even necessary to differentiate the subject in this case If so, then why do English sources leave it out If anything, it should be one of the first things learned, seeing that I basically had to re-learn all of the words I thought I knew how to pronounce perfectly.
This question already has answers here:                                            Closed 7 years ago.Possible Duplicate:How important is one’s pitch when speaking Japanese I know that the system to avoid confusion between homophones (regardless of if that was its original purpose) is pitch. The primary standardised Japanese pitch I heard is the Tokyo dialect's form (correct me if I'm wrong). My question is if you can be understood without pitch, and how will it reflect your pronunciation and fluidity. There are many different dialects of Japanese, are they mutually intelligible on the front of pitch If I don't include the standard pitch of the Tokyo dialect (or the local dialect), will I confuse people, not sound native, or will it be acceptable. If it's acceptable than will it be more like an acceptable mistake or completely fine If it is absolutely necessary (or of any necessity at all) I suppose I'll put in the extra time needed to learn pitch.

I have this phrase in my JLPT textbook, as one example of the use of バカ:自分{じぶん}だけバカを見{み}るThe translation offered in the book is:Waste time and money among othersThe English is both awkward and lacks context, so it doesn't help me understand the Japanese at all. The only thing I gain from it is that my own somewhat literal translation is almost certainly wrong. I would translate the Japanese as something like "look only at oneself (to a ridiculous degree)".Is this some kind of idiomatic usage What exactly does it mean and why
What suffix would be added to the end of a verb to make as it is being done (I'm eating), or that it has been done (I have eaten, I've ate).For example私は食べる, or I eat, 食べる would be converted into what to make it, I have eaten and I'm eating
Now I understand that although all the morae mentioned in the title are written in Hepburn as "sha shi shu she sho", they are actually palatalized and sound quite different (the little や makes it clear). In fact since I speak Mandarin Chinese natively, they sound completely different since in Mandarin the Hepburn "sh" and English "sh" are two distinct phonemes.Now in my Japanese class, the TAs are native English speakers though the instructor is from Japan. When the TAs are asked to read passages, the teacher occasionally corrects them for pitch accent, the う vowels, and らりるれろ, but never for the (to my ears) totally Englishified pronunciation of し. In fact  しゃ is pronounced exactly the same as the English word "shah" - it isn't even pronounced "shyah".I also notice some Japanese singers randomly pronounce しゃ as "shah" with no consistency at all. Then again, song Japanese seems to be weird (を retaining the "wo" sound, らりるれろ often using an "l" sound). My question is, are the two sh's completely indistinguishable to Japanese ears Even when correcting the students the Japanese teacher picks up on tons of small mistakes (mispronouncing the "u" as "oo", Korean people failing to pronounce the voiced stops, wrong pitch accent) but never picks out the clearly wrong "sh" that happens quite a lot.
I am curious about a bit of academic pedantry of trivial importance.If I wanted to put kanji in 日本人ではありません, would I use 有りません This looks weird to me because 有 has some connotations of possession as opposed to 居る, for example.

Does the 助動詞「ます」 have a 連体形  According to 大辞林, it's ます, and I see the old forms ます／まする on 学研全訳古語辞典.  However, in the comments on this question, Darius Jahandarie wrote the following:@snailplane That link does suggest that ます has/had a 連体形. Relative clauses (which is the only place you would employ 連体形) definitely does not permit ます on verbs -- why this is the case I am not entirely sure, especially with ます having a historical 連体形. This sounds like an interesting question that should perhaps be forked off. I've also found an answer on 知恵袋 suggesting it does, as in the examples:先生がおいでになりますときに式が開かれますところで、However, Darius Jahandarie appears to suggest it might be "historical" rather than part of the modern language.  If the 連体形 only appears in relative clauses and ます is considered ungrammatical in this position, doesn't that mean ます no longer has a 連体形 It seems like one of these pieces of information must be incorrect.  How can I make sense of this conflicting information
I've noticed that I don't see 〜ましたり used very often, but it does seem to be an accepted form. I believe this form can be broken down like this: 動詞{どうし}の連用形{れんようけい}＋「ます」の連用形{れんようけい}＋「たり」My understanding is that normally the sentence-final 動詞{どうし} is the one that is responsible for indicating the politeness of the sentence, while other verbs can be made polite depending on "how polite" you want the sentence to sound (as long as that 動詞{どうし} is not in a relative clause, and not in the objective clauses of certain verbs).However, 〜たり makes a 動詞{どうし} nominal, so it is not clear to me when, if ever, you should use the polite form of the 動詞{どうし} when attaching 〜たり. (On a potentially related side note, I don't think I ever see the polite form of a 動詞{どうし} when using 中止形{ちゅうしけい} either.)

According to the dictionary, the na-adj meaning of 危険 is "danger, peril, hazard"... What I don't get is how exactly "danger" is an adjective There is another option of "dangerous" in the dictionary, but it wasn't marked as a na-adj meaning. Ignoring the adjective comment I made above, I'd translate it as "A maze area in which there is a danger of roaming monsters" or something like that - but I wanna know why if possible :-)Thank you in advance!The sentence above was taken from the novel "Sword Art Online 1"!

Ignoring that part, I interpret the sentence as"All phenomena with mathematical properties are the objects of study of this science, and these are innumerable and increasing day by day, and are therefore near-impossible to list without omission."If it were "なりうる", as in なり得る, that would make sense to me. Then, any phenomenon with mathematical properties could be an object of study of this science, so therefore [...] there are too many to list without omission.When I Google "となるうるわけ", I get over 1000 results, but none that make it any clearer.

Obviously this is not a literal translation.What I don't get is the role that のだから plays in this case.I'd say it has a nuance of cause/result, but then why ので・から were not used in this caseAccording to the "best" answer in this question, のだから has 2 rules:  Used when both the speaker and listener know some fact, but expresses a strong feeling on the part of the speaker that the listener, although conscious of said fact, does not fully appreciate its implications.The clause following ～のだから often expresses the speaker's judgment, intent, wish, or request.I know for sure that rule (1) is not true in this case, since the fact given in the first part of the sentence was never previously mentioned in the book.As for (2), I'm still not sure whether the part that comes after のだから can be counted as a "judgment"...Hopefully someone can help me grasp the idea of のだから!Thanks in advance!I'd also appreciate even a list of all of the variations の・ん＋です・だ, so I could at least research them myself as I always tend to get confused with them... a link or a short summary of them would be even better but it's really too much of me to ask!Also, if you want to know, the sentence above was taken from the book ソードアート・オンライン１－アインクラッド。

I noticed there are many 形容詞{けいようし} (i-adjectives) that end in 〜ない, where the な is not part of the kanji, and doesn't seem to have the meaning 無い.Examples:危{あぶ}ない means "dangerous", while 危 means "danger"少{すく}ない means "few"/"scarce", while 少 means "few"/"little"切{せつ}ない means "heartrending"/"trying", while 切 means "earnest"/"ardent"(For contrast, examples where it's clearly 無い: 心ない, 情けない, 力ない.)I wonder where exactly this ない is coming from. It is not a classical Japanese ending to my knowledge (like 〜しい).I speculate that it could be an alternative shortening of the classical Japanese copula 〜なり, but this is odd to me because I suspect the usual shortening of 〜な would be used  if this were the case (as we see in 形容動詞{けいようどうし} (na-adjectives)).Does anyone know the etymology of these words and/or the meaning of this 〜ない

The following sentence is from "A Dictionary of Intermediate Japanese Grammar":留守番電話は、一方ではかかる方にもかける方にも便利な面もあるが、他方ではお互いに直接話が出来ないから、不自然な面もある"The answering machine is, on the one hand, very convienent for both a person who calls and a person who is called, but, on the other hand, unnatural because you can't talk directly with the other person"Despite not being particularly familiar with the usage of かける/かかる in terms of giving/receive phone-calls, the confusing part of this, for me, is the furigana given for 方 in "かかる方" is "ほう". Perhaps I am not understanding the sentence well enough generally speaking, but shouldn't this read "かた" As in "person who receives a phonecall" Is it read ほう because it means something more akin to "the side which receives a call", is there really a difference between these two
My friend recently played through a game called Persona 4, and he took plenty of screen shots.  He showed me this one containing 死す:It says:巽　完二  「言っとくがなぁ…  　可愛すぎてキュン死すっぞ！」I understood it as 死 + す, a literary alternative to 死ぬ.  I have to admit, though, it doesn't sound very literary to me in this context.  完二 is a tough guy, and he uses lots of verbal forms like 言っとく, so I'm guessing I misunderstood.To sum up my question, I'm wondering why it was appropriate to say 死す here.

The word なし, of course, means ない, and it is defined as such in dictionaries. But why does this word exist Are there even any situations where you can say なし but you can't say ない Is it a remnant of something from classical Japanese It seems similar enough in use and meaning to ない that it doesn't seem that it can be dismissed as its own word entirely and etymologically separate from ない. I checked etymology sites and dictionaries and tried googling, but I can't find any explanation for this word.
A while back I was trying to break down 〜なの, and this is what I decided on (with the help of some of Bart Mathias's posts on mailing lists).My hypothesis is that the nominalizer 〜の requires everything before it to be in adnominal form (usually meaning, 連体形{れんたいけい} for inflectable words).In the cases of 形容詞{けいようし} (-i adjectives) and 動詞{どうし} (verbs), the 連体形{れんたいけい} is of course just the 終止形{しゅうしけい}:形容詞{けいようし} (-i adj): 熱{あつ}いの動詞{どうし} (verb): 切{き}るのIn the case of 形容動詞{けいようどうし} (-na adjectives), the 連体形{れんたいけい} is simply adding 〜な, which works out great:形容動詞{けいようどうし} (-na adj): 変{へん}なのAnd finally, in the case of 名詞{めいし} (nouns), although they are not inflectable, we can consider both 〜の (possessive) and 〜な as ways to make them "adnominal" (I guess 連体詞{れんたいし} is the right translation into Japanese):名詞{めいし} (noun): 車{くるま}なのTo confirm this theory is actually true, I think the only avenue would be to look in historical texts to see if things like 大{おお}ききの, 死{し}ぬるの, or しずかなるの show up or not. Unfortunately, I am far from being able to do this myself, so I haven't been able to go confirm.If it does happen to be true, I wonder why the nominalizer 〜の would require things before it to be adnominal. Is の really acting so much like a noun It seems to be doing so syntactically, but really not so much semantically (from my beginner perspective). The only time it seems to semantically act like a noun is with 形容詞{けいようし} (-i adj) where you can kind of translate it as "thing" into English.This is my theory, but I'd be happy to hear about a 国文法 explanation if there is one, or an analysis which looks at historical texts.
I tried writing a classical Japanese poem:赤き空青かりたり根夢がごとし元を返るべし汚さざらましAnd here is a rough literal translation:The red sky,The origin that was once blue,Like seeing a dream,It would be best to turn back,If it were not dirtied.(Unfortunately missing all the word play and ambiguity I was trying to insert into the Japanese version.)I'm pretty unsure if I conjugated everything correctly there. I'm especially worried about 汚さざらまし, which I'm not sure if is even a valid construction. 汚す（未然形）＋ず（未然形）＋まし is what I was trying to do, to say "if it were not dirtied".I'm basically just doing this to learn a little more about classical Japanese grammar, so any corrections are welcome.
友 can interpreted as とも or ゆう rightSo in which word/sentence/context do I use first and when do I pronounce it as another transcription
I know there isn't a particularly distinct difference between L and R in native Japanese, but very often proper nouns and other non-translated Japanese names/words work their way into English translations. An odd thing I've noticed is that often when media is re-retranslated, Ls and Rs get flipped in proper nouns. I've noticed this a lot in Final Fantasy games in particular (Rally-ho turned into Lali-ho), and generally the later translations had better English. However I haven't really noticed more Ls turning into Rs or vice versa; I haven't seen any particular pattern to the changes at all, so I'm wondering what (if any) logic is behind it. Is there a "proper" way of determining whether a sound should be transliterated as an L or an R or are L and R picked simply based on which "sounds better" to whoever is doing the transliterating
If you ask someone how to say "peace" the likely answer you'll get is 平和, which is the common option, but occasionally you'll see the word 和平, which has a very similar meaning, and is indeed just a reversal of the kanji. Can 和平 always be used in place of 平和, or does one have a certain nuance that prevents them from being true synonyms
As I started peeking into Japanese, I see lots of characters in hiragana and kanji where the latter uses Chinese characters that are similar to traditional Chinese ones (I'm familiar with hanzi).For example, for the following kanji 関門 there's a simplified hanzi: 关门 (I'm not talking about meaning here, just characters). Also, country in Japanese 国 is same character in Chinese (simplified) as opposed to Traditional 國.AFAIK in Chinese, people hardly write using traditional style characters, since they are hard to use. Is it applicable to Japanese Or is the use of hiragana/katakana eases that difficulty or it isn't an issue for Japanese
For the two words, watermelon and melon:watermelon → 西瓜（すいか）melon → メロンWatermelon uses hiragana, whereas melon uses katakana.Why is this set up this way Is there a special rule that dictates the use of katakana in the original word or something
I looked up for fast food conversation but I could not find anything very practical.While most guide always emphasize on how to order, I never found it prepares one to understand what a fast food clerk may ask.For someone with basic understanding of the language, I think I can go as far as going to a fast food, greeting and ordering using the name of the item or the number of the set I would like. But most of the time I have to admit I don't understand what subsidiary questions are asked... I always imagined that the cashier may have asked dine-in or take-out or perhaps how I would want to pay but I always ended up stuck here (but eventually always getting the set I wanted) and still a bit frustrated I could not enjoy the "basic" conversation.Would someone be kind enough to depict a full conversation trying to focus and what may be asked Or at least how would a cashier ask the following:Do you have any point cardIs this for take-out or dine-outWould you like a trayWould you like to up-size your setthank you.
In the beginning of the music video for "Guns for Hands" by Twenty One Pilots (EDIT: http://www.youtube.com/watchv=Pmv8aQKO6k0), there's some subtitles:君だって気付いてもらえないよIt gets translated as "They won't know it's you." What does it mean to have もらえる here instead of もらう I would have thought it means "You can't get noticed" but doesn't that imply that he is trying to, or wants to get noticed In the context of the video, it doesn't seem like he wants to get noticed. He's being offered a mask.Some speculation... maybe the "can" form simply doesn't have that implication in Japanese, or maybe it doesn't have that implication in this specific case. Or maybe the "can"-ness somehow applies to the noticer, rather than the one being noticed (as in "they can't notice you")
This question already has answers here:                                            Closed 7 years ago.Possible Duplicate:What’s the difference between wa (は) and ga (が) I've been trying to wrap my head around the は/が differences, and I'm trying to figure out the differences between the thematic は and the neutral descriptive が.

These two seem to overlap almost completely.  The only thing I can really tell is that 触れる seems that it can also be used in a metaphorical sense ("touch on" something; feel; perceive).  I'm interested in how they are different in the sense of physically touching something.  It seems like they can almost always be used interchangeably, but I hardly see 触る as much as 触れる.  Yet earlier, I was reading my Japanese Bible, and within a few lines of each other, they are both used....女が近寄って来て、後ろからイエスの服の[房]{ふさ}に触れた。(a few lines down the same page)  イエスが二人の目に触り...見えるようになった。How do you choose which one to use when speaking of physical touch  Do certain circumstances or situations warrant one over the otherRelated question:  Is the potential form of 触る (= さわれる) ever used  Because when reading ふれる, I'll often reading it as さわれる and then have to correct myself.
Can someone explain the nuance between them  They both mean "come", but I'm unsure of when they are interchangeable.  My perception is that やってくる seems to put more emphasis on the actual action of coming (compared to the rest of the context, if any) than くる by itself.  Compare:友達が来ましたand友達がやって来ましたBut there seem to be times when you cannot use them interchangeably.  For example：○ さぁ、こっちにこい！　→　OK   さぁ、こっちにやってこい！　→　Sounds unnatural to meWill someone please explain where they do and don't overlap
I came a cross the expression かげぐち【陰口】(backbiting) and found it in my dictionary as follows  人の陰口をきく［たたく］｜[speak ill of a person / run a person down] behind his back / backbiteWhen I tried to look up the meaning of　きく the only transitive verbs that seem possible are 聞く＆　聴く. However these relate to listening or at best "asking" which does not seem to be quite same thing.Should I just accept such expressions as idioms Even if that is the correct course it seems odd that the entry for 聞く does not mention this use.

Steven Seagal stars in two TV advertisements for the energy drink アリナミン, as seen here and here. In the first commercial he is shown using martial arts two dispatch his opponents, while in the second he is depicted clinging to the top of a car involved in a police chase. In both ads he looks worn out and the voice-over says 「こう見えても、疲れまんねん」.Wikipedia gives the example of 行きます becoming 行きまんねん on the 大阪弁 page, so 疲れまんねん presumably corresponds to 疲れます in 標準語.How commonly is ~まんねん used This answer from Yahoo! 知恵袋 suggests it's rare - if this is so, are the Seagal ads trying to portray a certain image by using this pattern
In Japanese, is it acceptable to write kanji letters in the Chinese style  For example, is it acceptable to write 田 with the 3rd and 4th strokes swapped, or 着 with the 6th and 7th strokes combined
Conventional ビジネスマナー tells us that ご苦労様 is used by superiors to subordinates and お疲れ様 used by everyone, and this is backed up all over the internet and stated on some questions here, like this.But it seems that this isn't always such an ironclad rule. For example there is this question on here that shows that the power relationship might not necessarily as strong as people say, and this site in particular has a question along similar lines and one (very lengthy) answer saying that, on the contrary, ご苦労様 should be used toward superiors because it has a stronger nuance of thankfulness for work, citing examples from politicians and other uses that emphasize the role of the person rather than their rank, and that it may be changing such that it is appropriate to use it outside of the context of rank.In modern usage would it be a faux pas to say ご苦労様 to a superior or to someone you don't know Do native speakers really feel that ご苦労様 is more thankful
When looking at musical instruments online ([篠笛]{しのぶえ} and 竹笛{たけぶえ} in particular, but I guess this goes for more instruments), their 本調子 is always listed. Some flutes are ６本調子, some ７本調子 and some even ８本調子.When looking the word up on JDIC it says either:normal conditionkeynote;  proper key;The first translation seems illogical ('6 normal condition'), plus I've never heard of the term 'proper key' (and although English is not my native language, google doesn't yield much either). If it's just the key of the instrument, I don't see why numbers are being used to denote it. As far as I'm aware, Japan doesn't label musical notes by number.When looking up 調子, the result is this enumeration of pretty much every musical quality out there. Once again, not helpful.tune;  tone;  key;  pitch;  time;  rhythmAny musically minded people out there
Phone etiquette is one of those things I still struggle with at times, often fumbling because I'm not sure what expression I'm supposed to use at a given time. 失礼します at the end of a phone call is one of these. Technically if the other person is calling me, they're the ones "intruding," but if the conversation ends in such a way that I'm the one who is ending the conversation, it seems like I should say it even though the other person called me. I've had some weird moments where the other person said it and I just said it in return because I'm so used to saying "bye" "bye" in English.Does the person calling always say it, or is it wiggly based on the feel of the conversation, or am I wrong and in fact both people say it I don't usually get to hear both ends of the conversation when I hear other people on the phone.
I fear I may be venturing again into "just because" territory, but this one bugs me.We all know that you usually use いる (as in not ある) to refer to living things, as in 私は日本にいる（△ある）. Yet it is acceptable to use ある in the sense of "some" when the specifics are not important, so it's acceptable to say both ある日, for example, as well as ある人. ある人はそう言った。Is there a reason for this, or is it just an extension of that usage of ある (in which case why isn't it いる人)

I'm pretty sure I understand the usage of「である」 here:ピアニストである私{わたし}の姉{あね}は、いつも手{て}に怪我{けが}をしないように気{き}をつけていますMy sister, a pianist, is always careful not to injure her hands. (My translation)But I'm wondering if that usage is appropriate in all cases.  For one, my understanding is that「である」is literary-sounding and wouldn't typically be used in speech.  Is that the case here, or is that only relevant in the sentence-ending case  Are there other alternatives with the same meaning  For instance, could something like「のある」 or「の」be used in place of that「である」
So I ran across this example sentence: 食べている人はいますか？ And the translation was "Is anyone eating" However I thought the sentence would be: 誰でもが食べていますか？ Is this correctAlso is Xはいます = is any X Examples: 猫はいます = is any cat,　車はあります = is any car, 花はあります = is any flower.EDIT: I've added this question based on the answers so far. Based on what everyone has said, 花はあります = There is a flower, but I thought that　花があります is the (only) construct for that sentence structure.
I know that の is used as a noun modifier.But recently I've come across these pharases 心の強い人,母の作れる料理.The first phrases will be sth like strong person of heart/mind, which somehow differs from correct meaning strong-heart person (I think it should be 心が強い人).And the second one, since 母 clarify meaning for 作れる (as in 私にできることはない), I think it should be 母に作れる料理.So why の are used in these case

I occasionally come across text with a small font size where I can tell that there's either an handakuten ゚ or a dakuten ゙ in a kana character, but I need to zoom in to tell which one it is.Does this problem occur only for non-native speakers, or does it occur for native speakers as well, especially elderly onesAre there any other major problems with legibility with small font sizesIf so, does the Japanese government regulate that font sizes must be of a minimum size to be legible in any circumstance, such as safety-critical information
I've been using Japanese-Japanese dictionaries for a while now and this keeps popping up. It seems to me like a kind of usage that is found for the most part only in dictionaries. Can anyone help explain what exactly さま means in the dictionary definition below (It's from 大辞泉.)  It seems to be just a generic object that they modify with the term's definition, i.e. XYZ is a blah blah blah さま (thing).ささ‐やか【細やか】［形動］［文］［ナリ］１ 形や規模があまり大げさでなく、控えめなさま。「―な商売をはじめる」「―に暮らす」Any clarification would be really appreciated.
Why is ローマ字 spelt without an ンAs far as I can tell, it's not because you can't have an ん sound before a じ sound, because 漢字 has an ん sound before 字.Did early Europeans' term for Roman letters not use the letter "n"Also, does the ローマ in ローマ字 refer to the Roman empire whose language influenced the script used in many European languages, or did it refer to the main headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church, the religion of the PortugueseBackground: I want to know the etymology for the word ローマ字 so that the next time someone misspells the English word romaji (derived from the Japanese word ローマ字) as "romanji", I can not only say that the English word should be spelt "romaji", but I can explain why it's spelt that way. And the more detailed and authoritative the explanation of "ローマ字"'s etymology is, the more likely it is to be remembered.

My textbook (An Introduction to Modern Japanese) introduced 向こう as meaning "the other side of" and 側{がわ} as meaning "side". On page 76 it states that側 can be added to some, but not all, of these [location-specifying] nouns to indicate even more detailthen proceeds to give 左側, 右側 and 向こう側 as examples. The first two make sense, but I don't see how adding 側 to 向こう provides any extra detail whatsoever: we already have the notion of "side" from 向こう, after all.When would you use 向こう側 instead of 向こう and vice versa I've studied the examples available on WWWJDIC, but I can't find any clear pattern.
I was browsing a language exchange site and came across:私のように明るく、前向きな方がいいです。And the text under it (translation from the user who posted the entry) was:I'm hoping that you are cheerful and positive as me.To me, translated semi-literally, that looks like "My hope (is you are a) bright, positive person". Where is the equivalent of "as me" in that sentence Does "私の" act as both "My wish" and "As I am" in this contextOr is the translation just not the same as the Japanese text
I once heard that the Japanese like to use words like 「トイレ」 and 「お手洗い」 to refer to the water closet/bathroom because they are neutral and don't have dirty connotations, especially the English loanword, because it comes from a foreign language. That made me wonder, are Chinese loanwords still considered "foreign" and therefore more impartial or less emotional For example, would something analogous to Churchill's "We Shall Fight on the Beaches" (which used only English words of Germanic origin) line have any effect

I'm in the middle of writing a paper in Japanese, and I can't quite figure out which is right.  If I want to nominalize a な形容詞, should I affix さ or 性 at the end  I've been checking on search engines, and it seems that both are possible.  Is there a difference in meaningI am trying to write "The ease and frequency of so-called mass incidents..."Thus, should it be "いわゆる「群体性事件」発生の容易性と頻繁性..."Or rather "いわゆる「群体性事件」発生の容易さと頻繁さ..."　Again, is there a difference in meaning  Are they both correctThank you

I was looking for a word to say islander, i.e. someone that lives/was born in an island.I've come across 島人 and 島民 and asked two native speakers about their user meaning. While they both agreed that the second one is the more common option, I didn't quite understand the usage of the first.Is 島人 simply rare/less used or is it actually wrong It appears in my dictionary just fine but I'd like to look more into this.

This is a follow up to the question “What are the fundamental differences between the ～と一緒に and the ～とともに fragments”  Someone suggested that I post my question as a separate thread.Well, something is off for me. It seems that Derek and rcjsuen's answer clash somewhat. If I am being explicit or am emphasizing who I am doing an activity with, this implies that I and this person did everything together every step of the way. However, according Derek's answer, I would use 一緒に. But according to rcjsuen's reply, I would use 共に.So what am I missing in this understanding
(This might be a quick easy question but sometimes the answers to these are unexpected.)What is the subject in the following sentences？ I've given my best efforts for the examples 1-4 below.  (I am increasingly in favour of my alternative answer but still not sure.)1か月を経ても音沙汰{おとさた}がない｜A month has passed [elapsed] and we have had no news.なす事もなく日を経る｜spend [pass] one's days in idleness事故以来3年を経た｜It has been three years since the accident.2年を経て彼らは結婚した｜They got married [two years later / after two yearsFor what they are worth, my initial answers were:1. 時,2. 彼／私／自分, 3. 時 (same as 1) ,4. 彼らBut alternatively perhaps they are all 時 as in the sentence:時は止まる ことなく 流れる。  Time passes with out stopping (equivalent to "Time waits for noone")In sentence 2 there is a clause modifying 日 and in 4 we have two separate clauses. This is because:Although the clause is transitive in Japanese (or at least has a "spatial を" as in 鳥が湖を飛ぶ, the bird flies over the lake), the English equivalent has a specified period as the subject with an intransitive verb (as in "two years passed")

I recently found out that Jordan (the country) is spelt ヨルダン, not ジョーダン, which is how it's spelt in a person's name.Is this based on how it's pronounced in Arabic and/or Hebrew, or how it's pronounced in a European language other than English
In some countries, some people avoid using "Merry Christmas" and instead say Happy Holidays:Thought by some to be a politically correct alternative to Merry  Christmas and/or Happy New Year when greeting people in public places  due to concern over those who might not celebrate Christmas.(I'm not sure who'd be offended by Happy New Year - people who don't use a Gregorian calendar)Is it safe to use メリークリスマス If not, are there "politically correct" alternativesSearching jisho.org for season's did get some results literally translating as season's greetings, but I expect phrases written in kanji aren't likely to be politically correct euphemisms for "Merry Christmas".
I have this sentence in a JLPT study textbook, as an example of the use of しいて:食{た}べたくなければしいて食べることないから、食べられるものだけ食べてね。The translation is, "If you don't want to eat it, you don't have to, so only eat what you can." I can get that meaning, but, it seems to me that if しいて weren't in the sentence, it would still mean the exact same thing.食{た}べたくなければ、食べることないから、食べられるものだけ食べてね。The book says that しいて is "an expression that shows compulsion", and does not give much else for explanation. So it doesn't really say enough to help me see what しいて brings to the party.What exactly does しいて mean, and how does it make a difference in the two sentences above

This question already has answers here:                                            What is the etymology of とある                                (2 answers)                            Closed last year.What is the function of と in とあるIt doesn't seem to be the particle と--it doesn't seem to attach to whatever comes before it, which particles generally do.  It also doesn't seem to fit any of the uses of the particle と described my in books.  So, I guess it must be something other than a particle.So far, I've found this answer on 知恵袋.  It suggests that と is this 副詞 meaning 「そのように」 , the same と in とにかく.  And, as @Chocolate points out in a comment, 学研全訳古語辞典 agrees that the と in とある is a 副詞.However, in another comment, Chocolate points out that 広辞苑 says と is a particle.  I'm not sure how to reconcile this with the other information I've found so far.  (I don't have 広辞苑 myself, so I can't verify the quote.)  As I said before, it doesn't seem to behave like a particle to me, because it doesn't attach to what comes before it.  Is 広辞苑 wrongWhat is this と exactly
All the に vs で comparisons I can find discuss using them with verbs. However I recently wanted to say something like "I am alone at home", and phrased it without a verb:家で一人ですBut that got me thinking whether it could also have been:家に一人ですbecause my understanding is that に is used in a similar way with ある/いる for "existence in a place".Google has lots of results for both. Can I use either If so, what's the difference
Does Japanese have a term more-or-less equivalent to the German Klugscheißer (literally, "clever-shitter"; in English: smartypants, smartass, know-it-all, etc.)(Needless to say, this is not a term suitable for polite conversation!)The best I could do was to look for translations for "smartass" or "smartypants".  All I got this way was 賢い人, which, AFAIK, is not considered particularly vulgar, and does not even carry the derogatory/mocking overtones of the Klugscheißer.  (But please correct me if I'm wrong!)P.S. If you found an online source for this translation, please include it in your answer!  I had no success with the many I tried, including a short video entirely devoted to equivalents in various languages (but not in Japanese).
I am having problems finding a word in this sentence in the dictionary:一体全体なぜこんなところにおいでになったのか、たぶん話してはくださらないのでしょうねUnknown word:- はくださらないThe English translation is:"And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here, of all places"I get the meaning thanks of the translation, but I wonder which word はくださらない comes from.  Looking up はくだす gives no results.

Japan describe the concept in Japanese asこの祭日に選ばれる恋人；（一般に）恋人.Is there a word for this concept in Japanese, and if so, what is itIf it's relevant, it's being used to describe a guy in Japan, rather than a woman in western countries.
My Japanese friend used the term 自殺志願者 jokingly in a journal entry, saying she sometimes wondered if she qualified for such a  position. I could not find a specific dictionary definition for this word, but found it translated as:suicide wanna-bethose who want to kill oneselfwould-be suicidesuicide volunteer/ suicide candidate (the latter being the most literal translation)In common context is this word ironic Is it a comedic term in and of itself If it is a common word, is it used mostly in a clinical or in a jocular way

There are quite a few comments on anotherquestion discussing the sentence 彼が持っているのは二百円です, in which the emphasis apparently falls on 二百円.  I posted a comment asking if this could be explained as the pattern AはB emphasizing B rather than A, but I received the answer "No. Why"  I decided to delete my comment and create a separate question to discuss what I meant.Here was my reasoning:In Japanese: A Comprehensive Grammar, there's a section comparing は and が, which says the following (p.588):When attached to the subject, ga emphasizes what precedes it, whereas wa focuses on what follows, i.e. pred. (in English, this difference can sometimes be captured by intonational stress).In fact, it refers to は as a "focus particle" (p.577):wa is a focus particle, but unlike mo (see 94), which focuses the N, etc. it is attached to, the basic function of wa is to focus on what follows, i.e. the pred.Later, it describes a specific use of は, "marking known information" (p.580):One function of wa, which is in keeping with its pred.-focusing effect, is to be attached to information that is already known or understood.  In this use, wa has an effect similar to the English definite article (and other cases where a N refers to something known or previously mentioned).So, in the sentence 彼が持っているのは二百円です, I interpreted は as marking a subject, and in particular, marking known information (彼が持っているの).  This causes the focus to fall on the right half, as described above.  I tried to express this generally as "the pattern AはB emphasizing B, not A".Does this make sense  If not, can someone explain why it is wrong
My dictionary says 助動詞{じょどうし} means "auxiliary verb".  This sounds intuitively correct; 動詞 means verb, so 助動詞 sounds like a type of verb.But the 助動詞「ない」 looks like an auxiliary adjective, not an auxiliary verb.This is confusing.  I suppose I don't know exactly what a 助動詞 is.  Does it mean that ない is a type of verb  That seems strange, because it doesn't look much like a verb.  Or is 助動詞 a wider category than just "auxiliary verbs"  That seems strange, too, because they're called 動詞.What exactly is ない

When I first started learning Japanese, I learned that 飲む meant "drink" and 食べる meant "eat".  These translations seemed to work for a while, but then I learned that you could 飲む things that you can't drink, like 息, タバコ, or 錠剤.While going through various definitions for 飲む, I found one in particular that caught my eye (which I've abridged here, taken from the 集英社国語辞典):１。（液体や固体を）かまないで、口から体内に取り込む。「ミルクをー」「薬をー」２。（気体を）吸い込む。「たばこをー」It got me thinking: is the fundamental difference between 飲む and 食べる whether you chew before you swallow  Can I express these words as:飲む "to pass something through the mouth and into the body without chewing"食べる "to pass something through the mouth and into the body with chewing"Or is there a better way to explain the difference
彼が持っているのは二百円です。 Supposedly this means "It is 200 yen that he has.". But I am really not familiar with this sentence construction. Therefore, I'm not sure how everything before の works with the rest of the sentence. Or what の is doing in the first place.

Can somebody explain the difference between these two expressions I have pasted the definitions and some examples from 日本語表現文型辞典 to help but they seem to come down to the same thing. (When can one be used but not the other and why)といい＝も= both...and：speaker gives evaluations by enumerating several examples to show that result is the same from all angleseg:運動といい、勉強といい、僕は何をやってもダメだI am no good at sports, study or anything.といわず=も=not only..., but：strongly emphasizes by listing several examples that cannot be distinguished. Also can mean everywhere, always, all etceg:日本人は子供といわず、大人といわず、漫画をよく読む。The Japanese, adults and children alike, often read comics.手といわず足といわず、子供は体中泥だらけで帰って来た。They came home covered in mud from their finger tips to their toes. NB These are my translations using what I think are equivalent colloquialisms.
Counter words have different readings for 1 through 10.  How do I use them for number 11 and beyond Do I change the counter's pronunciation based on the last digit of the number So if the number is 21, do I use the reading for 1 What if it's 20 Would the original counter be used Like "nijuu-nin" for 20 people I can't seem to find a guide for using counters past 10.
Could someone explain the difference between 姿{すがた} and 形{かたち}I've looked up both words, but I'm still not clear on what the distinction is, or how much overlap there is between the two.  My mental concept right now is that 形 represents the "outline" or "shape" of something, and 姿 represents the features within the shape.  I'm afraid this might be terribly wrong!(I'm also curious about 姿形, but I'm not sure I should include it in this question.)Can anyone help
It is known to Japanese learners that the Japanese verb isn't affected by the subject (number or gender). Today, a linguistics professor of my university told me he heard from his teacher that ancient Japanese had some kind of plural declension.I tried to search on google and on this site but couldn't find any information. So I'm asking if you know something about it.
I know Wine is written as ワイン. I've also seen Whiskey as ウィスキー. In both english words, the 'w' sound are relatively similar (although slightly different).I'm assuming ウァ would be somewhat like ワ.But then there is 'Valentinus' written as ウァレンティヌス and I don't understand why ウァ is used as VA (instead of ヴァ).Could anyone please point out what the differences (especially between ウァ and ワ) are, I think I'm confused (maybe because we don't have the english 'w' sound in German).
So I know that a few words could be used interchangably. But I wasn't sure if I got the nuance(s) correct. So I have this sentence: 車はどこにありますか。 車庫のそばです。 And as far as I can see, I can change そば in this sentence and the meaning stays the same.車はどこにありますか。 車庫のそばです。 車はどこにありますか。 車庫のよこです。車はどこにありますか。 車庫のところです。車はどこにありますか。 車庫のちかくです。車はどこにありますか。 車庫のとなりです。Now the sentence with となり, I'm not sure of because a car is certainly nothing like a garage. However, car and a garage are car-related. Any fine details I overlooked
I've been thinking about how to express a duration of time and how in the past I have added 間{かん} in situations where I found that I shouldn't have.Take the following sentences as examples.○：　３０分後ご飯を食べる。☓：　３０分間後ご飯を食べる○：　３年前日本に行った。☓：　３年間前日本に行った。○：　３時間後出かける。☓：　３時後出かける。Of course there are other examples that I could give but I think this kind of boils it down to the main point. When I think of 間 as a concept I generally think of it as an emphasis on start-to-finish time, like １年間日本語コース or something like that. Why, then, does this not apply to expressing time in the future/past Specifically I have said before something like １年間後日本に行く or something like that, using 年間 in the same way that you would use 時間, only later to find that is not natural usage.So this leads to the question of why these words cannot all be used in a consistent way. Is there something special about 時間 as a word that excuses it from counter, or are the rules inconsistent, or is there a pattern that I'm missing I'm aware of 時間 as the word for hours, but as in Chocolate's answer, we don't say 一時間間.
I've read that several bits of Japanese come from contractions with ある:だ comes from で + ある (source)なる comes from に + ある (source)たり comes from て + あり (source)たり comes from と + あり (source)Adjective forms like たのしかった come from inflecting たのしく + ある (source)(My apologies if I've made any mistakes in the above list!)Because contraction with ある seems to have occurred quite a few times, I started wondering if the suffix 〜がる (as in たがる or ほしがる) was a contraction of が + ある.  I realize this is baseless speculation, but it sounded plausible to me, so I tried to look it up to see if it was right.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find anything about the etymology of がる online, and my dictionaries don't say anything on the subject either.Is this possible  Is there a better explanation

I've recently been having trouble with constructions that seem to mark two subjects in the same clause. I've only encountered them in ～の方が... constructions, but I can't seem to make sense of them grammatically. Here are some examples:当然、都心より郊外のほうが家賃が安い。 (from a vocabulary book)（人）よりも自分の方が知識があると思う (from アルク)My questions are: why are two subjects allowed here, and are there other constructions in which this happens  So far my thoughts on this are:(a) 方 seems to be a subject, but not have a verb. So maybe this is simply be some kind of relative-clause-like construction with the noun elided away, e.g. 家賃が安い[ところだ] and 知識がある[人だ]. But this seems a little odd - I don't know of anywhere else where this is possible.(b) The second sentence might bracket as （人）よりも自分の方が([blah]と思う), rather than (（人）よりも自分の方が[blah])と思う. This makes perfect sense, but I suspect that the と思う could be removed to leave a valid sentence, so this explanation seems a little spurious. In any case this doesn't explain the first sentence.So I'm a little confused. Any light anyone can shed on this would be great. Thanks!
I am on Livemocha and it says that 買います。 means "I am going to buy it." But I figure that should be 買いに行きます。 . Also I know that ぎゅうにゅうを買っています。 is "I am buying milk." But for some reason, I thought that ぎゅうにゅうを買う. could also mean "I am buying milk." In short, I'm confused about when/how to use which conjugation for what.

I was watching the anime かんなぎ, and heard the following line:男はみんな[狼]{おおかみ}だわ！  "Men are all wolves!"I was curious as to what it means to call someone a "wolf", so looked 狼 up in Daijisen and it came up with "someone who feigns being gentle, but in reality is a terrifying person" in the 2nd definition.But why exactly did 狼 come to have this connotation Does it have similar origins to the English phrase "a wolf in sheep's clothing" Or something else

As in "Wu Tang" or something similar.  Would it be something like ウゥ  I know that "wool" is written as ウール, but 1) the "woo" sound is pronounced slightly differently than "wu", and 2) ウール doesn't give you the "pushed" sound of the 'w'.And not just at the beginning of a word.  Specifically, I was watching this video of a guy who goes by the name of "Swoozie", visiting Tokyo.  How would he (or others) write that name
In an answer on another question, @TsuyoshiIto wrote:[U]nlike commas in English, 読点 in Japanese is rarely (if ever) grammatically required. Authors are free to use 読点 wherever they feel that it makes sense to make a pause when pronounced.And in a comment on yet another question, @dainichi wrote:I think [こわいだから] might exist in some dialects, but in standard Japanese, it is ungrammatical regardless of formality. Unless it's こわい、だから[...] which is something else. (emphasis added)What is this "something else"  According to answers on two other questions (this one and this one), だから is simply だ + から.  Therefore, I would expect *こわいだから to be ungrammatical because *こわいだ is ungrammatical.  In fact, I would expect だから to only follow things that だ can follow.However, I'm having trouble reconciling what @dainichi and @TsuyoshiIto wrote.  If *こわいだから is ungrammatical, and 読点 aren't required, how can こわい、だから be grammaticalPerhaps my confusion stems from the difference between these forms:*こわいだから。こわい、だから[・・・]こわい。だから[・・・]Can だから be explained as だ + から in all three cases  If so, does that mean だ can begin a sentence or clause, or is だから somehow special  What is the "something else" referred to by @dainichiIn short: how can I make sense of this

("My anger melted away.")I don't actually understand the grammar, though.  The phrase 「怒るに怒れない」 has what appears to be particle-に following the dictionary form of a verb.  It sounds contrastive.  I can't seem to find this pattern in my dictionaries, though, so I feel unsure.I'm interpreting it as 「怒る(の)に怒れない」, with a zero-nominalizer after the verb.

I've heard けど / でも has to be placed after the part that contradicts the other part.I never heard of it actually as I learned it by context and not by grammar rules.  Is it true, or does it depend on what the speaker means to expressFor example:What is the correct way to say "I can but I can't be bothered"(Please also include another, better way of saying it if you know of one. It wouldn't hurt to learn something new :) )(1) できるけど、めんどくさいよor(2) できる、めんどくさいけどよMy ears tell me to go with (1) as it makes more sense to my ears.However, according to my brain, I should go with (2), since Japanese particles usually apply to the word they come after... but then again there are exceptions to almost everything in Japanese so I'm really confused.P.S.: This problem may even arise from my understanding of English, as I'm learning a 3rd language (Japanese) through a 2nd language (English).
I have encountered another sentence while translating some text of Japanese historyThe sentence is:人家の竈（かまど）から炊煙が立ち上っていないことに気づいて租税を免除します。 jinka no kamado kara 炊煙 gatachiagatteinai koto ni kidzuite sozei wo menjo shimasu.So I have these words:人家 jinka炊煙I have problem with the meaning of jinka. Does this refer to houses and buildings in that period of historyIn case of 炊煙. As I found out 炊 taku means cooking and 煙 kemu means fume and smoke. So Do I presume well if I think they mean "fumes and smokes deriving from cooking" And how can we pronounce it

かわいい is sometimes spelled in kanji as 可愛い. This seems to be an 音読み reading which points to a Chinese loan, and Chinese does have this word.However, the meaning of 可愛 as "cute" in Chinese seems to have been a borrowing from Japanese. Originally it meant what its individual kanji meant, "able/deserved to be loved". For example, the Chinese Union Version of the Bible, translated in 1919, often uses 可愛 to mean "deserving of love", which is incongruent with its modern meaning borrowed from Japanese.Also, かわいい seems to have been かはいい in 歴史的仮名遣い. はい would have come from "pai" which would be a stretch from on'yomi.So 可愛い seems to be 和語. Why then did it get assigned a pseudo-音読み reading

あんぐり is defined as such:adverb / noun or verb acting prenominally:  open-mouthed大学の門の前に真っ赤なフェラーリが停めてあるのを見て、アングリした。 I saw a bright red Ferrari parked at the campus gates and my jaw just dropped.I am confused by seeing it in examples such as the following:あんぐりと口を開けてあんぐりと口もひらきThese examples seem redundant but why are they not What information am I lacking that would distinguish あんぐり from 口を開けて In English, the expression "with mouth agape," means to have one's mouth open in astonishment or surprise. It would seem to be a similar expression to あんぐり. To me the quoted examples seem redundant in meaning, but are they communicating two different things to those fluent in Japanese Is there etymological information to the word あんぐり that would change my understanding of it Can あんぐり mean "in astonishment/in amazement" without referring to the mouthIn the quoted example below, it is especially the も that is throwing me off. What extra meaning does it give the sentence Is this も an adverb meaning "more / further"After giving it further thought, I came up with these interpretations below. Do they make senseあんぐりと口もひらき = "He gaped in astonishment, his mouth widening even more..."Or maybe a better translation is : " With jaw-dropping astonishment, his mouth widened even more..."Original example:幸夫の横で、あんぐりと口もひらき、逃げようともせず、ただぼんやりしている叔父にしても、 今、眼の前に起こっていることが信じられないにちがいなかった。

The character is clearly an amalgam of 久 and 米 used in a man'yogana-like manner, but:Why did this particular surname get a designated characterDoes the surname have a meaning, or is it opaqueMy suspicion is that there was a well-known 粂 who chose to write their surname in an idiosyncratic way, which others sharing the name came to use.

(In this question, I will use "Volitional" to mean "V-(よ)う".)As I understand it, Volitional + と + する is a phrase meaning "to try to do something".

I'm sorry my questions are so vague. If I knew how to be more specific, I would.For context..中生代にさかえ、今はもうほろびて、地球上にはいないとされている恐竜が―。その恐竜が、今、幸夫たちの眼の前へ、網走湾の海底から立ちあがったのである。そして、それは、海岸めがけて歩いてくるのだ。幸夫たちの方へ、近づいてくるのだ。幸夫には信じられなかった。幸夫の横で、あんぐりと口もひらき、逃げようともせず、ただぼんやりしている叔父にしても、今、眼の前に起こっていることが信じられないにちがいなかった。ふたりとも、何も考えられなかった。頭の中が、からっぽになったようだった。恐竜は、短い前足を胸のあたりにだらりとさげ、あと肢だけで歩きながら、砂浜にあがってきた。からだの大きさは十メートルもあるだろうか。眼を赤く光らせ、からだ中から水をしたたらせながら、その恐竜は、幸夫たちの乗っている車の前を、通りすぎていこうとした。
I have been encountering this word kakemawaru 駆け回る a few times. It means running around, If I understand well.Does it mean only physically running aroundFor example: kids are running around in the park.Kodomotachi wa kouen de kakemawatteimasu.Or can one also use it to express 'having a lot to do, I have been running around the city to do errands.' so that we are busy and we "run here and there" the whole day.Thank you for your help in advance^^
This morning I took this picture, finding the 一人KY poster amusing:QUESTION: What is the kanji before 中 In Gjiten I can't find it by combining the radicals of 止 and 残, nor by number of strokes (17) plus 止 radical.I guess the poster says "If you don't pay attention to your environment, you are at risk" (which the side text あなた自身があなたを守る says too), but knowing the kanji would confirm or infirm this hypothesis.
Can somebody describe the difference between these words(physical distance and maybe politeness of these words, or any aspects that you think are important to understand these). Can all these words be used with any objects like buildings, pens, people, dogs etc. Or is it more common to use some words more then others when talking about some of these 付近、近辺、辺り、近所、周辺, 辺(thank you user1205935)I've found this link, but it's about expressing the idea of being in the surrounding of a town so it's not exactly what I need.
My friend published a multi-part video on Facebook. I wanted to comment "I survived for only one episode", as in "It was so bad I couldn't keep watching after just one episode", but I wasn't sure which word would fit for "survived".  (I'm also not really sure this is a metaphorical usage.)I thought about:1話だけ残った1話だけ生き残ったBut, I think both sound really, really ridiculous.
白い箱はカウチの上に緑のランプは机の上にあります。This sentence looks like it has two topics in it. But when I try to translate it, it doesn't make sense (to me obviously). My direct translation is: A white box on top of the couch a green lamp is on top of the desk. Obviously, that's not gonna work. To me, it's like the first phrase is missing a verb. What am I missing
What's the difference between the usage and meaning of そもそも and もともとThey both seem to mean something like "from the start/to begin with/originally" in dictionaries, but I believe their usage differs. I've seen numerous explanations by searching:The accepted answer at this Chiebukuro page says that it's a difference of time for もともと and logic for そもそも.This page says that そもそも, but not もともと can be used for expressing the essence of things or for criticizing other people, and that the former is subjective and the latter is objective.Another page in that same thread says that もともと is the state before a change, and そもそも is used for how things come about/the essence of the situation etc.While dictionary definitions for もともと and そもそも are very similar, I think the examples there are making me lean more towards the second explanation, but I think there also might be some other ways which they differ.
If I say:16日[以降]{いこう}参加できません。  It means I cannot participate after the 16th.However, what about on the 16th  Is it also implied that I cannot participate on the 16th either  Or, that I can participate on the 16th, but not after
A recent post about translation reminded me of the following saying:Before enlightenment, chop wood carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood carry water.It is said to be coming from zen buddhism, which is commonly referred to as a Japanese school of buddhism. I was wondering if this saying is actually commonly used in Zen (in Japan), and especially what the writing would be.Although it seems interesting, I am by no means a practitioner of buddhism. I came across this saying a lot when searching the internet, but never with a source of translation. Zen originated in China and buddhism uses a lot of sanskrit texts, so perhaps the saying is not of Japanese origin in the first place, but it never hurts to ask, right
I'm learning a bit of Classical Japanese recently, and of course the spelling of words is pretty different, due to sound changes over the centuries. For example, きょう was spelled けふ. That I can understand, since no language has static sounds.I then went to YouTube and listened to a Japanese guy explain Classical Japanese. In the first lesson what he did was explain "historical kana orthography" and gave a whole bunch of ridiculous pronunciation rules. Yes, I understand that was how Japanese pronunciation changed over the centuries, but why should we emulate the sound shifts into Modern Japanese when we are reading Classical Japanese What bad is there in reading いろはにほへと、ちりぬるを as "i ro fa ni fo fe to, ti ri nu ru wo" as it used to be pronounced
イケてる is defined by tangorin as such:noun, or verb acting prenominally:cool;  with-it;  turn-on;  sexyAs a noun I can see it as "the state of being cool," as perhaps shown in the following example:イケてるというのは中身のある人間のことだと思います。 外見で人間は測れません。Being cool is about what is inside someone. You can't judge someone on appearance.*note: This example was from the Hiragana Times and thus may not have been written by a Japanese author. If it strikes you as unnatural, please say so. The translation is mine.As a prenominal verb there is this example:ここはただの田舎だと思ってたけど、ここに、こんなイケてる場所があったなんて知らなかったなあ。I was thinking that it was all just countryside around here,  but I didn't know there was such a cool place like this.I understand these usages, however, the word itself confuses me.What is the etymological origin of the イケAs a verb, is イケてる an abbreviated version of イケているCan it be reduced further (to the "dictionary form" of the verb)  or is イケてる the "original starting point" of the word (In the way 食べる is the starting point here: 食べる→食べている→食べてる)Can イケてる/イケている be applied equally among gendersIs it related to 行ける (The ichidan verb meaning → :to be good (at);  to go well;  —Colloquialism..... to look (taste, etc.) good)zokugo-dict.com says that it came from a Fuji TV variety show in the 90's, and that it is a variation of the verb いかす, meaning to be cool or stylish (or is it related to 生かす · 活かす).http://zokugo-dict.com/02i/iketeru.htm
I was doing some Rosetta Stone earlier, and I came upon a sentence ending with:行きたいです。Noting the "たい" part, I was reminded of the word食べたいですwhich I think I first saw in Japanese 1010, and I'm sure I've read and said while doing Rosetta Stone. At this point, my supposition was that "...行きたいです is to 行きます as 食べたいです is to 食べます."Observing the "です" ending, I suspected that (1) 行きたい is a noun, which jisho.org confirmed...albeit only if I searched for "いきたい." If I  search for "行きたい," it pares my search down to "行く." And (2) I suspect that these "たい" forms might be a common occurrence, as a way to make the "I want to [do some verb]" form of a word.I was then a bit surprised to see that "食べたい" (or "たべたい") wasn't in the dictionary. Google Translate recognized it and translated it to "want to eat," so I imagine I wrote it correctly, and all that.So then, my questions:食べたい is a word, right Rosetta Stone hasn't been feeding me made-upwords I'm keenly aware that the reason it doesn't come up injisho.org might just stem from jisho.org's search engine, but Ifigure this question is still worth asking. (Of course, since GoogleTranslate translated it, I'd be surprised if the answer is anythingbut 'yes, of course it's a word.')Was I wrong to infer that these "たい" forms (forgive me if they have a better name, or if I'm completely mis-classifying them) arebuilt on the same roots as the verbs I have no encountered many ofthem yet...and a sample size of "two words" isn't a lot to go on, Irealize. Still, it's in my nature to start trying to infer things,as early in a learning process as I can manage.Is it possible that 食べたい is some type of conjugation (of yet another word) that I simply haven't heard of yet "たい" does come upin jisho.org as an 'auxiliary adjective,' which this entry:1: (after the -masu stem of a verb) want to ... do something; would  like to ...; (Particle)This suggests that the answer to my 2nd question is that, yes, there's a clearly-defined process for taking the root of a verb, putting -たい at the end of it, and calling it the 'want to [verb]' form.Honestly, after putting this question together, I'm starting to think that the answer might look like this:"(1) Yes, it's a word; it just doesn't have an explicit entry in jisho.org. (2) No, that inference is ok, as you surmised after looking up "たい" and seeing that first entry. (3) Yes; as you said, it uses the -たい ending. Really, it's just time for you to learn more about these 'auxiliary adjectives.'"I'd prefer to hear it from someone more knowledgeable then myself, of course. ^-^One more question, to tack on: (4) Are these -たい words always nouns
I understand that the word シクシク is 擬声語/giseigo/onomatopoeia equivalent to the English "boo-hoo/boo-hoo-hoo."恐怖でシクシク泣く: To whimper in fear彼女はボーイフレンドに捨てられた時、あまりの惨めさにシクシクと泣いた。: She wailed in misery when her boyfriend dumped her.However, I also see it as a qualifier for pain, but I can't tell what kind of pain it describes. Is it a pain so "gripping" as to make one sob, or is it a "dull" pain (which implies something more to be inconvenienced or annoyed by)シクシクと痛みます: It is a dull pain.胃がシクシク痛む: have a gripping pain in one's stomach

Closed 8 years ago."Aikido Wa Ichiban Budo Desu" is supposedly a quote from 植芝 盛平, Ueshiba Morihei (founder of Aikido).Most people translate this as "Aikido is first and foremost a true Budo".My question is: how are you supposed to write this using Japanese charactersI came up with: 合氣道が一番 武道です but on the other hand my Japanese proficiency is non-existent.Can someone provide a proper "translation" (starting from the possibly mangled phonetic version in the title... this is all I have at the moment) and doublecheck if any japanese source shows this as a quote from UeshibaA bit of clarification: "Aikido Wa Ichiban Budo Desu" has been banged around on Aikido blogs  (again, so far I have seen it mentioned only in Italy) for a couple of years. Always written phonetically like this.I have been unable to trace it to something more solid, so I hoped that if I could reverse engineer it back to properly written Japanese I could look up a more creditable source.It is completely possible that this is (another) completely bogus quote or factoid (I suppose that Martial Arts are a rich source for this) or that it was misunderstood/wrongly transcribed - I am ready to accept that this is completely wrong, I am just trying to see how far I can go in proving (or disproving) it.Update: apparently the sentence was expressed by Ueshiba Kisshomaru (son of Ueshiba Morihei)  and it was written as "合氣道は、いうまでもなく本質的に武道である".Credit goes to a couple of answers I got on the Martial Arts Stackexchange.It may be possible that Morihei expressed the same sentiment (he often spoke of Aikido as the "perfect" or "final" Budo) but there seems to be no written record of someone actually saying "Aikido Wa Ichiban Budo Desu". I suspect that this specific factoid started from western people training in Iwama (with Saito Morihiro Sensei) so maybe this was someone who tried to express the concept without having a perfect fluency in Japanese.
If 営み/いとなみ/itonami is a noun meaning: work;  life,then is 愛の営みをする a literary way of saying "to make love" What feel does this expression have Does it sound perfunctory or passionate愛の営みをする to make love to～と情熱的な愛の営みをするto make passionate love to
I am in a Japanese 101 class. We are supposed to translate the following sentence:日本ぶんかの先生は、イケメンですが、ぜんぜんやさしくないですから、あまり好きじゃありません。I am having trouble with that word イケメン. So far, I have:The Japanese culture professor is ______ but he/she is not lenient at all so I don't like him/her very muchI am pretty sure we haven't had イケメン in class. Also, "ikemen" doesn't sound like an English borrowed word (at least to me). Google translates it as "Twink" and I have found some places that say "handsome", "cool", etc. But I don't know what to trust. Can anyone explain to me the meaning(s) of the word
I was studying on another website and ran across a blurb that said that a pen is also called mannenhitsu in Japan. Is there a difference between the two If not, is mannenhitsu said sometimes, just as often, or more often as pen in Japanese
It has long been a pet peeve of mine when people talk about apes calling them "monkeys".Recently I've seen bonobos being called 猿 in an anime, so from that it's pretty clear that 猿 also refers to apes informally in Japanese. So I've been wondering:Does 猿 also mean ape in technical/scientific Japanese speechFrom what I was able to gather from Wikipedia and dictionaries, apes (Hominoidea) are ヒト上科 and great apes (Hominidae, which is what a bonobo is) are called ヒト科.But that does not clarify whether 猿 can be used technically to refer to them, or even if 猿 is accepted nomenclature in scientific/technical speech at all.
I've found the dictionary definitions of 手数 and 手間, both that are translated to "time, labor":手数１ それをするのに要する動作・作業などの数。てかず。「―のかかる料理」２ 他人のためにことさらにかける手間。てかず。「お―でもよろしく」「お―をかけて恐縮です」VS手間１ そのことをするのに費やされる時間や労力。「―を省く」「―がかかる」...３ 手間賃を取ってする仕事。手間仕事。また、その仕事をする人。「―を雇う」What I don't understand are the nuances. I.e., when can/should one be used and not the other, or when can both be used.
Assuming such a concept exists in Japanese, how do you say "tourist trap"Wikipedia describes it as:A tourist trap is an establishment, or group of establishments, that  has been created with the aim of attracting tourists and their  money. Tourist traps will typically provide services, entertainment,  souvenirs and other products for tourists to purchase.and Travel Stack Exchange describes it as "A disparaging term for places and attractions designed specifically for tourists."While it's often used for describing attractions, it's also used used for describing cities or areas overdeveloped for tourism, for example:Unfortunately, many tourists believe the highrise buildings and crowds  of Surfers Paradise make it an overdeveloped 'tourist trap'. Most of  these buildings are however local residential. The city also has many  services and industries not directly related to tourism.I tried using 「観光トラップ」 to ask if Atami was a tourist trap, but that apparently didn't work well, as it attracted a few comments. One person mentioned 「ぼったくり」 (ripoff), which seems a little too vague.The English edition of Wiktionary doesn't have a Japanese translation, and the Japanese edition doesn't even have an entry for "tourist". Jisho.org has 「観光都市」, but according to the Japanese edition of Wikipedia, 観光都市 is a city that's popular with tourists, rather than something dodgy or artificial. Oddly enough, the Lonely Planet phrasebook for Japan didn't have an entry for "tourist trap"!
I have a question relating to question 19 of the JLPT N5 'example' grammar exam. This is a question where you have four things to fit into four gaps:A: [会社 ＿ ＿ ＿ ＿ 行って いますか]B: [わたしは あるいて 行って います]で  2. は  3. へ  4. 何I guess that the translation is roughly:A: How do you get to workB: I walkHowever, I am having trouble arranging the particles into the correct order. I suspect that 会社 is the topic of the sentence, and thus should have は in the first free slot. I would group 何で together, as meaning 'by what method'. My attempt at the full sentence is thus:会社 [は] [へ] [何] [で] 行って いますかBut I am confused about the presence (and location) of the へ particle. Is this necessary to indicate the motion towards the office Could I form a 'fuller' answer like so:会社はへ歩いて行っています
I have problem with word use again:)there are these two words 園地 (enchi) and 庭 (niwa)。as far as I know 'niwa' refers to a garden around the house rightWhat about 'enchi' does it refer to a house garden as well or maybe to the garden of a shrine or templeThank you for your help!
I would like to know how to express that something is equal in some aspect to another thing (or person, if that makes a difference), as you would express in English by saying:X is as (adjective) as Yfor example: This car is as fast as that car.It would also be interesting for me to learn how to say:"is not as (adjective) as""is nearly as (adj) as""can/might/will be as (adj) as""want to be as (adj) as"Thank you very much for your help!
I've come across two different ways (at least, apparently for me) to classify verbs. Please note that this question is fundamentally different from Verb classifications by japanese learners.The first classification is to divide verbs into Godan and Ichidan, which I think is good for reference, but not clear at all for learners (you can't really guess the number of conjugations by just looking at the verb).The second, which I personally find clearer, is to divide them into る- and う-verbs. According to this last division:With the exception of two verbs, all verbs fall into る- or う-verbs.All る-verbs end in る, while う-verbs end in -う (including る). Therefore, if a verb does not end in る, it'll be necessarily a う.verb.For verbs ending in る, if the vowel preceding る is /a/, /u/, /o/, it will always be an う-verb.If the vowel is /e/ or /i/, it will be a る-verb in most cases.So what's the difference between the two Is one system adopted by Japanese and the other adopted by learners (e.g. in JLPT) Or they totally coincide but just have different names

I am trying to understand something from the N4 and N5 practice test book. I think the sentence has revealed a gap in my understanding of the use of 「-て」 verb conjugation.The complete sentence is:きのうはうちに（  かえって  ）何をしましたか(where the bracketed part was to be filled, and I have inserted the correct answer).Word for word, I would translate this as:きのう - Yesterdayうち - Homeかえって - Returning (or something similar)何 - Whatしました - DoingBut I am having trouble understanding the meaning as a whole; I think this is down the use of the 「-て」 verb. Some ideas for a rough translation are:Yesterday, I/you returned home by what methodYesterday, I/you returned home and did whatYesterday, what happened when returning homeNone of these really seem likely. What am I missing here

While studying I came across this short 会話{かいわ}：A:　この本をもらってもいいですか？  B:　ええ、いいですよ。どうぞ。A was translated as: "Can I keep this book" Now, I've learned that もらう means to receive (something). I would have thought that another word would be used for "keeping" or "taking ownership" of another object. Am I wrong
This page discusses the "adjective" べき and mentions that if it had evolved like other adjectives, it would have been べい.That made me think: Why are there no 形容詞 ending in /ei/ or /ii/ (except for /sii/) This assumes that we disregard "slang" like わりい, あちい, あけー, やべー etc.And what is special about べき (the only exception that I can think of)
The following is a JLPT N4 question:旅行の荷物はもう___できました.  １。 やくそく　２。りよう　３。せわ　４。よういI don't really understand the meaning of the sentence.Is it "I was already able to do the preperations for the trip" as in "I already did the preperations" But then できました doesn't neccessarily mean potentialOr is it "I was able to do the preperations (even though I didn't do them)" Since then the sentence just sounds odd, doesn't it(The correct answer according to the answer key is 4 by the way)
According to my dictionary, the following words all mean the same thing: "Dinner":[夜]{よる}ご[飯]{はん}, [晩]{ばん}ご[飯]{はん}, [晩飯]{ばんめし}, [晩食]{ばんしょく}, [夕]{ゆう}ご[飯]{はん}, [夕飯]{ゆうはん(ゆうめし)}, [夕食]{ゆうしょく}A similar thing goes for "Breakfast" ([朝]{あさ}ご[飯]{はん}, [朝飯]{あさめし}, [朝食]{ちょうしょく}) and "Lunch" ([昼]{ひる}ご[飯]{はん}, [昼飯]{ひるめし}, [昼食]{ちゅうしょく})What's the difference between them Are they mostly interchangeable Which ones are more commonly used or is it a matter of preference etc.My current understanding is that the ones that end in ご飯 are politer.
The word 今度【こんど】, though its literal meaning is "this time" is in my experience used pretty heavily to refer to tbe next time or some unspecified point in the future. For example:今度【こんど】こそ一緒【いっしょ】に行【い】こう！  Let's go together next time!This has confused me since I was just beginning to learn Japanese, and I messed it up again not too long ago, after years of study. Maybe some reasons will help keep this straight in my head.Why is 今度【こんど】 so often used to mean "next time" or "sometime" rather than "this time"
I thought when you have a consonant-stem verb ending with -ku you replace it with -ita. For example kaku ("to write") becomes kaita.But this doesn't happen with iku, which becomes itta, so I guess that makes it irregular – are there any other such verbs
I encountered a Shogi saying:三桂あって詰まぬこと無しAnd I'm pretty confused about the ぬ there. If it was る I'd expect the meaning to be something like:"If you have 3 knights, you can't be mated"But looking at it's explanation here and here it looks like they are talking about mating (attacking) and not getting mated (defending). Well, while typing this I suddenly realized I can just search google for ぬ instead of る, so I'll guess I'll be answering my own question as I was encouraged to do on other StackExchange sites.
I wanted to describe that 「えっと」 was similar to "Ummm" in English when someone is trying to think about what they are going to say, but I wasn't even sure if that was correct. Is that just a generalization What does 「えっと」actually come from Can it be considered to be a word or phrase
I'm currently studying Japanese vocabulary following the JLPT programs. I'm doing the JLPT 5 and I've come across the word 写真.According to my dictionary, the meanings are:Photograph, photo.MovieA friend of mine, Japanese native speaker, has expressed some doubts about whether nowadays people actually use 写真 to mean movie. Note, I'm aware of the word 映画{えいが}, but I wasn't that surprised of seeing an alternative word: as we say film, movie, we can have 映画, 写真, etc., but as I'm not a native speaker, I can't say for sure what's the actual answer.Is perhaps the movie term there to refer to the "photo films" Just a bold guess, actually. But what is it then References on the matter would be much appreciated.
wanted to ask a question re:company names in 日本語.Would「七つの海商社」work as a name for a company Or does this combo of kana+kanji not work in formal business namesGreatly appreciate any help. Thank you.
As I understand it works like this. By the time Japanese kids enter first grade they have more or less decent vocabulary of words they know. So when kanjis are taught I can't even imagine how to tell in Japanese that, for example, 女 means "woman"(おんな) and has a kun-reading おんな, since meaning and reading is the same word.「女」漢字は意味が「おんな」です。くん読みが「おんな」だ。Something like this It looks like only readings are taught and kids kind of figure out the key meaning on their own, based on the vocabulary they possess.Note that I'm self-taught in Japanese and though I use JLPT N3 materials, I can mess up in basic things.Another example. When person wants to explain using what kanji to write his/her name how do they explain that How to identify exact kanji if one reading links to numerous charactersIn English I rely a lot on using key meaning to identify the kanji, but what exact wording do I use in JapaneseHope you can help me out. Thanks.
My wife is studying for the JLPT exam, and came across the following question:２時間、＿＿＿＿＿立って話しました。She narrowed the choices down to:すわらずにすわらないとOr another similar question:あの花は５日に＿＿＿＿＿とさきません。ならずならないIn both cases, the two answers seem "correct".
