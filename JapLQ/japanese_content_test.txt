I found these sentences using SPACEALC:The content in parentheses and bolding are my own:まず勝ち試合と見ていいが、成り行き任せでは駄目です。  You'll probably win the game, but that's not automatic.ゴドフリィ・ノートンはこの件に深く関与していると見ていいだろう。  "This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter.＜that以下＞は間違いないと見てよい。  It appears certain that例えば、「おはようございます」と言ってみて相手の外国人が「はあ？」と不思議そうな顔を見せたら、日本語を話せないと見てよい。  If, for example, you say, "Ohayo gozaimasu," and they look at you perplexed and utter, "HUH", it's pretty good bet that they don't (speak Japanese).勇気は人間の資質の中で最も重要なものと見てよい。なぜならそれは他のすべての資質を保証する資質だからだ。  Courage is rightly esteemed the first of human qualities, because it is the quality which guarantees all others.First I would like to draw attention to sentences 1 through 4. I gathered that と見てよい means something along the lines of "appear to be"Then consider sentences 2 and 5 where it seems to have the senses of "evident" and "rightly esteemed" which is like my previous conclusion of "appear to be" except much stronger.Then consider sentence 2 that ends in だろう, which weakens the assertion.This makes me a little confused. (Question) What does と見ていい・よい mean  How does this link back to what we know of て-form + いい
Can anyone explain the expression やれやれだ/やれやれだぜ I saw it in a written journal entry to mean "Thank heavens!", and on further investigation have seen it translated as "Good god!" as well as "Sigh." It's probably an outdated expression, but could someone tell me if it's still used and why it means what it means
My question arose when I was trying to rationalise the first two sentences below. I wondered if these two verbs (越すand  越える） formed a pair with one transitive, one intransitive (like 消える &amp;　消す）with を　acting as a "spatial object marker" for the intransitive form (as in the sentence 「飛行機が空を飛ぶ」, 飛ぶ being an intransitive verb) but the dictionary entries and examples 3-5 below suggest they are both transitive verbs of similar meaning. (越す　possibly has wider use.) Could somebody familiar with these answer my question above and rationalise the sentences with these verbs below駅を乗り越す| go/ride past the stop 彼は門を乗り越えて庭に入ってきた｜He climbed over the gate into our garden.川を越す｜cross a river国境を越える｜cross the border球はライトの頭上を越えた｜The ball sailed over the right fielder's head.Bonus: what is the difference between these two verbs and 超えるMy answer to the bonus:I think that where as 越える　is used for "crossing over/going past" when referring to tangible actions (and possibly compound verbs) such as those in the examples above, 超える refers to non-tangible abstract events such as exceeding a limit or crossing/transcending a generation:支出が収入を超えた｜My expenses exceeded my income.彼の作品は世代を超えて愛読されている｜His works are loved by people of all generations.but confusingly the word for transcend is 超越　which used both!Please correct me if I am wrong.
I gather that 皮肉 can literally mean "skin-meat." I also see that one definition for 皮 is "mask (hiding one's true nature);  seeming." So perhaps 皮肉 can be understood as "hiding the real meat," which can be related to irony. What is the real answer
What would the correct way to write and say northeast, northwest, north-north-east, etcIn Chinese, we put east and west first and then put north or south at the end, for example, 東北 for northeast.Is this the same in Japanese And would the Japanese pronunciation be とうほく, ひがしきた or something elseAlso, how would one write or say directions such as north-north-east or south-west-south (ie. Cardinal directions with three parts)
In the course of localising an app for the Japanese language I have been tasked with translating the Google-style error string "Oops", which will presumably be used as in  Oops  Please check your password and try againPresuming we want to preserve this conversational interface style (such is the brief), would しまった be an appropriate translationGiven that this app will be used by children, I would like to know if this is considered acceptable language or not. If not, are there some good "family-friendly" alternatives
Don't say it, if you don't want to.You don't have to say it, if you don't want to.How do I convey these in Japanese correctlyMy idea is 言えないこと言ってないもいいです。But I am really confused by verb conjugation here.Don't say it = iwanai ienaiDon't want to say = ienai But then it would mean 'I can't say'....Could you please help in both translation and explanation for these two conjugation forms.
While reading a text in Japanese, I came across the phrase "何も言わなくなったから".  I don't understand what the ～くない stands for. As far as I know it is used as the negative of an adjective... but 言う is a verb! It's like 言わない (the negative form of 言う) was used as an i-adjective.  Any thoughts

How is it possible in Japanese language to express concepts of recall and remembranceI mean, recall is generally referred to the way we take out something from our memory which is related to people, situations and experiences of our life.On the other hand, remembrance is the way we successfully recall not an experience, but something we learnt, something we were taught about.
Sorry if this is a really open-ended question, but one thing occurred to me when I was asking a prior question here; are there any particular grammatical errors frequently made by native Japanese speakersFor example, in English there are quite a few obvious mistakes that native speakers make - your vs. you're and me and Sally went... rather than Sally and I went... and often non-native speakers of English are better at distinguishing between them than native speakers.Is there any such Japanese grammar that is commonly used incorrectly by native speakersI am more interested in common mistakes than obscure mistakes; mistakes where one would think that a native speaker should know better.
I know that もちろん is often used to mean something like "of course (you may)" or even "naturally, ..." However, what would an equivalent expression be for "of course!", used as an interjection as a result of sudden realization or comprehension For some reason, もちろん doesn't seem right, and I don't believe I've ever heard or seen it used in this context.
Can I get away with memorizing only these two forms of a verbDictionary form かえる ("to return")Positive polite non-past form, like かえりますIf I compare these two forms, I can determine whether it's a Type 1 ([五]{ご}[段]{だん}) verb or a Type 2 ([一]{いち}[段]{だん}) verb.I can do this by checking if (for example) る gets taken off when I add ます, or if it gets changed to り.  Does this make senseI'm asking because this packet I got tells me to remember the dictionary and past forms, but I don't see how this is helpful.  In short, is my method of learning these verbs' types consistent  Thank you in advance :)
(Moved from Insertion of "y" sound between vowels since it appeared to be unrelated.)In the following quote:私の世界へようこそ。 今やこの世界をコントロールできる唯一の人間だ。What is the function of the particle や here  I see a definition for 今や in edict:now (esp. in contrast to the past); now at last; at present; right nowI don't understand how や figures into this, though.  I would have expected 今は.  Is there any way to understand the function of や here, or should I memorize 今や as a set phrase
I was watching some anime today, and I heard "y" sounds in places I didn't expect.  Here's a sound clip (MP3) and my transcription:私の世界へようこそ。  今やこの世界をコントロールできる唯一の人間だ。There are two "y" sounds I didn't expect.  I'm not sure whether they're related.世界へ sounds like "sekai ye" rather than "sekai e".世界を sounds like "sekai yo" rather than "sekai (w)o".Can anyone explain these "y" sounds to me  Are they standard  Common

Context: 織次{おりじ} the protagonist is trying to buy back a set of drawings from his father's friend, who is mysteriously evasive about the matter.[織次]{おりじ}も[後]{のち}に[東京]{とうきょう}から[音信]{たより}をして、[引]{ひき}[取]{と}ろう、[引]{ひき}[取]{と}ろうと[懸合]{かけあ}うけれども、ちるの、びるので[纏]{まと}まらず、[追]{お}っかけて[追詰]{せりつ}めれば、[片音信]{かただより}になって[埒]{らち}が[明]{あ}かぬ。  Later on, Oriji would also mail him from Tokyo, trying to take them back, but it ended up with no conclusion because he would . When Oriji further pressed him for a definitive answer, he would not even return a response, leaving the matter unsettled.   From a short novel "国貞{くにさだ}えがく" (1910)What does ちるの、びるの meanI guess from the context that it probably means "after a lot of fuss" in effect, but looking up "ちるの、びるの" or "びる" in various online dictionaries yields no relevant result.Grammatically, I think I understand which particle is doing what at least, but I'm unsure about the "content" words:ちる: verb  の: parallel marker  びる: verb  の: parallel marker  で: reason, cause  One possibility is that this is some play on words. The novel contains apparently Meiji-era slangs like レコ (reverse of これ), so this could be something in the same vein.

Let's take for example, a teacher.If our relationship improves, and it becomes permissible for me to speak casually to the teacher, then if I speak to that teacher in the presence of another party. How should I behave(Question) Is the politeness determined by accountability to the person I'm addressing, or is it accountable to external societal pressures
Context: I have been chatting with a Japanese girl who is going to move to Germany, and I asked if she had any experience with the German language and told her I had been considering learning German recently.Her response went along the lines of, "I'm very enthusiastic about learning German..." and then...素晴らしい。ドイツ語も勉強しないとですね。Am I right in thinking that means...Wonderful, if you aren't learning learning German too.Am I missing something with the grammar/context here Surely she would rather say "Wonderful, if you're learning German too." Could it be a typo I am not advanced enough in the language yet to know whether something is an obvious mistake or not!

I'm guessing this is a pretty straightforward question. Examples would be helpful too, thank you!
How is 潔{いさぎよ}い related to 清{きよ}いFirst, I'd like to point out this question: [潔]{いさぎよ}い　meaningSecond, I've found a possible etymology for 潔{いさぎよ}い on gogen-allguide. 　Gogen-allguide seems to say that いさぎよい probably comes from 甚{いた} + 清{きよし}, with いた expressing "to a great extent".  Assuming I understood right, I don't quite see how this leads to the modern meaning(s) discussed in the other question.I've also seen the word きよい written as 潔{きよ}い.  This has me puzzled, too, because I'm not sure if it's supposed to express anything besides 清い.  (My character dictionary doesn't list any such nuance, if so.)  Is this a hint to the connection between these words, or a red herring
A client sent some materials and I have to respond, so I want to give a quick thank you acknowledging that I have received the materials and will email again once I have reviewed them. (It's always important to get back to prospective clients quickly even if you don't have a proper response ready.)For the "I'll review them and get back to you" part, I came up with the following possibilities, but none of them really seem right for a business situationご確認して、改めてご連絡致します。     (Is して OK in a business situation)ご確認の上、改めてご連絡致します。  (Just doesn't sound right somehow)ご確認させて頂きます。備えたら改めて連絡致します。 (Probably not this one, but I thought I'd add it for good measure)Something else
Can anyone explain the etymology of それはそうと【其れはそうと】and possibly the grammar of how it fits into a sentence, which does not seem to follow the normal rules (It should have a copula だ、そうだと？) I think of it as equivalent to ところで.  The Apple dictionary defines it as 〔ついでながら〕by the way; incidentally; 〔さて〕welland for reference, it also gives the example sentences:それはそうと昨日は中野さんに会いましたか｜  By the way, did you see Miss Nakano yesterdayそれはそうとあの本はやはり山田さんのでした| Incidentally, that book was Mr. Yamada's, just as we thought.それはそうと次の会合はいつにしますか｜Well, then, when shall we have our next meeting
It's my understanding that when telling what you did after an action can be said using:た後で てから た後にFor instance,さおとめさんが泳いでから私たちはお祭りで会いました。 さおとめさんが泳いだ後{あと}で私たちはお祭りで会いました。さおとめさんが泳いだ後{のち}に私たちはお祭りで会いました。And those 3 forms can be used interchangeably.However た後から seems to also be used for after [verb]-ing, but has the added effect of implying a cause and effect relationship. Or put another way, action A was a result of action B. Is this a correct assumption Is my understanding of this correctNote:　た and　て are denoting the tense the verb has to be in.
Earlier today I read the following excerpt from a message:結局今日はゲームやらなかったよ！ また、暇なときに開けようThe part I'm most unclear on is how to translate 開けよう. First off, let me mention that I'm currently working on making the transition from only recognizing the 1st-year textbook types of sentence structures, and learning the many ways that the various particles can be used. So, what I'm getting at is I'm not at all sure how to interpret に. (^.^')I'm inclined to think that's it's being used to say that 暇なとき is the object to the transitive verb 開ける. Then, perhaps, 開けよう is either a conjugation with which I'm simply not familiar, or perhaps it's just a contraction of akeru-yo, with the う at the end being added for the same reason that there was a ♪ at the end of that line. (Which, I suppose, can be chalked up to 'feminine speech.')Speaking of which, the speaker is a female from the Nagoya area, if that sheds any light on colloquial choices or what have you.So, if I'm correct in reading the second sentence as "himanatoki-ni akeru-yo" then this still leaves me unclear on how to interpret 'akeru.' In the dictionary I use (jisho.org), the definitions include things like "to open, as in a window" or "to open, as in a business." There is another definition, however, of "to empty; to clear out; to make space; to make room" that seems promising. So, perhaps I can interpret the sentence as "Rest assured, I will make room for leisure time."Anyone care to offer their own differing interpretation  Also, any insight on recognizing uses of に would surely be helpful and appreciated. I'm currently reading a book on grammar and particle usage, but I'm still in the 'absorbing' phase, so much of this stuff is still floating freely in my mid-range memory, waiting to be solidified.
We can personify things. By using "want" with an inanimate object, it is personified:An object with inertia wants to maintain its state of motion.(Question) First, is it possible in Japanese for this kind of desiderative sentence to be formedIf it is possible, do I use ～たい or ～たがる Because according to Derek Schaab's answer to "When to use 欲しがる instead of 欲しい":you cannot presume to know the intimate details of a third person's mental stateand even if you're 100% certain he wants, you can't say this directly.Will an entity that does not hold volition take ～たがる when personified
What would one use for the equivalent of the "inter-" and "intra-" prefixes in Englishe.g. intercity, intracity, inter-server etcI did a fair amount of looking around. 間 looks like it might be usable for some of the inter- words and 内 for a fare few of the intra- (intramural soccer = 校内サッカーリーグor学内サッカーリーグ？）but I was hoping there would be something more consistent.
This has been split from this question.. So what are differences between two Are there times where they can be interchangeable or can they only be used in certain situationsI saw this about ことがある.
The reason why I ask this question is because of the pattern I've seen with Japanese numbers. Once you have to repeat a number to describe itself, you get a new unit. For example, 十十 =　百,　百百 =　万, 万万 =　億. So it seems that 千 is a number that had some Western influence in its creation. Implying that it was a number that created in more recent times (ie. the last 200 to 300 years). Am I in the right direction with this pattern I'm seeing Or is this just coincidence
So I came across this sentence: あなたをむかえるものがある。My take on it is: There is a thing that will meet you. I know that's wrong. So how is ものがある usedADDED: Is there a difference between ことがある and　ものがある？

I only have basic 和英 definitions to go on, but I'm guessing the nuance is that 覚える has more to do with things you learn or study, and 見覚える is more like remembering experiences. Or is there something more, or are they just synonymous
What does テラス means in the context of declining an invitation, like belowうううううう！！いきたい！けどその時間帯もろに仕事だ：：：またやって！！テラスーーーーーI guess it is slangI am familiar with テラワロス but it seems different in both spelling and context.More context: Public comment sent on a night-time birthday event page on a social network. テラス is not her nickname.
I recently heard this phrase being told in a show, but I just couldn't make sense of what it means...And what really caught my attention was that the listener was really surprised to hear this phrase being told.Here is a quote:A: じょうきょうが　うんたらかんたら。B: ええ！　いま　「うんたらかんたら」っていったよな！Thank you in advance

First, some real-world examples of "&lt;名詞&gt;、それは&lt;名詞句&gt;。" :イノセンス、それはいのち (catchphrase for the movie イノセンス)リゾートホテル、それは[極上]{ごくじょう}のサービスに[心]{こころ}[満]{み}たされる[空間]{くうかん} (catchphrase used by a certain resort hotel)  歓{よろこ}び。それはBMW。 (catchphrase for the Japanese market used by BMW)Is it correct to say that these are formed by "left dislocation" and "体言止{たいげんど}め"For instance, the underlying sentence of the first example, I think, isイノセンスはいのちだ"Dislocation" is a grammatical term describing a sentence structure in which one constituent is taken out of its normal place of occurrence, either to the left side or the right side. The dislocated element's original place is often occupied by a pronoun. (Heavily drawn from Wikipedia.) For example, "These things, they take time."Applying left dislocation turns the sentence into:イノセンス、それはいのちだ"体言止め" is a figure of speech in which a sentence is terminated by a noun or a noun phrase.イノセンス、それはいのちAll seem nice and well, but I'm not sure because I couldn't find any source talking about this construct in any way. Is the hypothesis correct, or am I missing something Are there other possibilitiesEdit:I did find this chiebukuro Q&amp;A which states the English equivalent of the construct is "extraposition." It lists examples like "The demands, restrictions, pressure, fatigue, ― they spoiled the fun." Inferring from this comment to a Language Log entry, this type of extraposition is now classified as left dislocation.So...whatever the grammatical term is, there's one supporting view that a transformation is in the work here which extracts the topic and places it outside the normal sentence structure.
Some speakers, mainly middle-aged and older males, sometimes pronounce ねえ as [ne:], i.e. with a more closed variant of the usual /e/-sound, let's call it [ɛ]. There are also speakers for the same approximate group who sometimes pronounce そう as [sɔ:], i.e. with a more open variant of the usual /o/ sound, let's call it [o], usually when going そうそうそうそう.Usually this just strikes me as slightly amusing, and it seems to have the same effect on other speakers of my approximate age group (early thirties). However, on further thought, this is actually interesting. Some of these speakers otherwise speak standard Japanese and don't use (as far as I can tell) these vowel variants in other words.So my questions are:Do these vowel variants appear in other words that I am missingWhat is the history of these vowel variants (if any) Are they by any chance remnants from historical phonemic mergers, or are they just one-off phenomena
《俺が威嚇射撃する   ゴーを出したら   突入だ》I will fire a warning shot, when GO begins  (must) rush in.My shot at figuring out a translation above. I figure it's something like, I will fire the warning shot, then say go, then we proceed, which is what happens next in the show.  Just now seeing how it all connects grammatically.  Edit: 《瀬文隊長が威嚇射撃後 ゴーの合図で突入します》is spoken right before they go in by another officer.  From that it's clear that: After the commanding officer fires some warning shots, on the signal "go", we storm in.
I just saw the word "goodbye" spelt as さよなら. Having clearly heard the long o sound before, I thought the word was misspelled. However, a quick online search shows both さよなら and さようなら being used. Is there any semantic or usage difference between the two words
Are there written systems (preferably international &amp; standardized) that you can use to depict how to pronounce any word from Japanese and any language. Something similar to Romaji but one that can be used for any languageCan't remember well but back in a linguistics class, I thought they showed me some kind of international alphabet (which just looked like modified Roman alphabets with weird tildes, lines, and such) that you can use to break down and identify any particular sound and pronunciation for any particular language. They may have called it a phonetic alphabet or something.ExampleSo, what I mean is if I want to show a Japanese person how to properly pronounce "加油", I can turn to this international written system. The Japanese person, in turn, can use the same phonetic notation to show how to pronounce "Ganbatte".What I wantDoes such a phonetic notation existIf so, can you provide a list mapping the sounds these characters make using that phonetic system あ,い,う,え,お,か,き,く,け,こ,さ,し,す,せ,そ,た,ち,つ,て,と,な,に,ぬ,ね,の,は,ひ,ふ,へ,ほ,ま,み,む,め,も,や,ゆ,よ,ら,り‌​,る,れ,ろ,わ,ゐ,ゑ,をThink on Wikipedia calls them the Hiragana base characters.No Kanji though.I hope that makes sense.
My book has these two sentences and I don't quite understand why they are using には in the first example and では on the second one. It seems to me that only では would be correct in this situation.１）わたしの　[学校]{がっこう} には　アメリカ[人]{じん}の　[先生]{せんせい} が　います。２）わたしの　[学校]{がっこう} では　[中国語]{ちゅうごくご} が　[習]{なら}えます。To make things even worse, the explanation given is the following:は is used to highlight a noun as a topic, and when が or を follows the noun, it is replaced by は. When other particles (e.g. で、に、へ、etc.) follow the noun, は is placed after them.EDIT: Wow, thank you everyone for the very detailed and helpful answers.

(Italics are used to indicate revisions to the orginal question made in response to feedback so far)According to "A students' guide to Japanese grammar", by Naomi McGloin, の is used as a pronoun meaning "one" for tangible or intangible objects such as 車 or 意見　but not highly abstract ones such as 力 . The following three sentences are given:大きい車は高いが、小さいのは安い。correct田中さんの意見は面白いが山田さんのはちょっと問題がある。    correct日本の町人は経済的な力を持っていたが、政治的なのは持っていなかった。incorrectCould somebody explain/define a little bit more clearly the difference between an intangible object and "a highly abstract" object illustrated by these sentences(Or in other words both are intangible but only 力 is "highly abstract": possibly highly abstract means "subjective" () but if this interpretation of "highly abstract" is correct, could anyone give a few more examples to help me nail this down)
Is it a nuance difference  Is it formalityEDITFor example:請求書のお支払いは現金のみとなりますので、ご了承くださいませ。請求書のお支払いは現金のみになりますので、ご了承くださいませ。I just made that example up, but for some reason, my gut tells me it's the first one, even though I don't see anything grammatically wrong with the second, either.  Is it formality level only
The question is a the bottom since the context may be an issue.Here is a problem from a study text (kanzen master N1 reading)以下は（株）ANTONIOのホームページに掲載されていたおしらせである。問いに対する答えとして最もよいものを一つ選びなさい。「マリア・ホセ・ペレス　フラメンコショー」公演延期のお知らせ３/１９（月）南町ホールにて予定しておりました「マリア・ホセ・ペレス　フラメンコショー」は、本人急病のため、急きょ公演延期とさせていただくことになりました。ファンの皆様には、多大なるご迷惑をおかけいたしますこと、深くお詫び申し上げます。つきましては、以下の日程で延期公演を行います。延期公演日程５・２２（火）南町ホール　開場・１８：００　開演・１８：３０３・１９（月）のチケットをお持ちの方は、延期公演にそのままご入場いただけます。チケットを大切に保管いただき、延期公演当日に持ちください。尚、チケット代金の払い戻しを希望されるお客様は、以下のどちらかの方法でお手続きをお願い致します。いずれの場合も払い戻し期限は４・１９までとさせていただきます（郵送の場合は４・１９必着）１。プレイガイドまたは弊社での手続きチケットを買い求めのプレイガイドあるいは弊社にて、払い戻し手続きをお願い致します。３・１９のチケットと引き替えにお手続きをいたします。２。郵便によるお手続き払い戻し先情報（お名前、ご住所、お電話番号、金融機関名、支店名、口座番号、口座名義）を記入したメモをチケットとともに封書にて弊社まで送りください。その際葉ならず簡易書留でおお願いします。送りいただいた際の郵便代金は、払い戻し金振込時に、併せてご指定の口座に振り込みます。お振り込みはチケット到着から3週間後になります。ご不明な点は以下までお問い合わせください。２０１２年3月１４日。。。問い：サムさんは南町駅前のプレイガイドでチケットを買ったが、5月22日の公演に行くことができない。お金を買えしてもらうのに最も適切な行動はどれか。１。チケットを(株）ANTONIOへ持って行き、払い戻し手続きをする。２。チケットを買ったプレイガイドへ、払い戻し先情報を書いたメモとチケットを簡易書留で送る。郵便代金はサムさんが負担するが、後で戻って来る。３。宅配便で払い戻し先情報を書いたメモとチケットを（株）ANTONIOへ送る。送料は立て替えるが、後で戻って来る。4。簡易書留で、払い戻し先情報を書いたメモとチケットを(株）ANTONIOへ送る。郵便代金はサムさんが負担する。The answer guide says the correct answer is the first answer.  It says the third answer is wrong because チケット送付は郵便で行う. I understand the first answer is correct but still have some questions about the answer.My first question is why is 宅配便 not considered a subset of 郵便 as indicated by チケット送付は郵便で行う- is that term only for the Japanese post office, as opposed to the English 'post' or 'mail' which I assume you can use with other companiesAlso, the sentence ３・１９のチケットと引き替えにお手続きをいたします led me to think going to ANTONIO or プレイガイド and exchanging the tickets would be a ticket exchange and not a cash back refund. Please clarify why this deduction is wrong.
So when people are doing comparisons, do you use のほうが colloquially or even in text I've seen AとBとどちらのほうが速いですか？　and also AとBとどちらが速いですか？And the answers be: AのほうがBより速いです。  AはBより速いです。  Aのほうが速いです。But I wonder if normal colloquial Japanese wouldn't just express it as: Aが速いです。 or even Aはもっと速いです。 Can のほうが be left out when replying
A group of people are talking about the best way to get rid of a monster in their town and one of the villagers says this: 仕方{しかた}あるまい。このまま放って{ほうって}おけば村は[全滅]{ぜんめつ}するかもしれん…。From what I understand, まま means to leave or stay as is and ほうっておけば means if it's left as it is. So I'm wondering if both of them are necessary for this sentence to make sense or they are both put together for emphasis. Because they seem to be saying the same thing twice.
So I saw this sentence: きのう初めておすしをたべました。 And wondered if the は is just being left out. Does the sentence change any if は is added in Like so: きのうは初めておすしをたべました。
This question came up on chat. In this phrase:TOEIC、頑張ってくださいCan the comma be replaced by を  If not, is there a better particle頑張る is listed as a 自動詞 in both of my dictionaries (岩波 and 集英社).  There are plenty of Google results for を頑張る though, including in phrases like TOEICを頑張る.  I've also found some related discussion, though it didn't answer the question.Possibly related: Are there verbs that are neither intransitive nor transitive
I read this phrase in a book:・・・・[彼]は口の中でうなった。I'm guessing the うなった is 唸った, or groan, but I'm curious as to if 口の中 has a meaning or implication other than the obvious, inside his mouth. How does one groan if not inside one's mouth My best guess is that it's something along the lines of "under his breath"...but that still doesn't seem right to me. For context, the 彼 is (something like) a high priest who's speaking with the emperor (which is what makes me think he is trying to suppress a groan out of respect).
Google translates both of them to be interesting. And which can be used for a funny guy
Is there any source or explanation for the phrase「頭にきた」and why it means to be angry For example:彼の言ったこととその言い方にはイライラして頭にきた。Why does "what he said and the way he said it came to my head" mean that I should be annoyed or irritated Why is 「頭」important and not something else At first glance, I thought that the phrase was similar to "気づく", but it is not.
Consider questions like:Please leave the door open, thanks!Could you please keep the lift's doors open ThankyouPlease, leave it as it is.They all imply something common: not changing the state of something.

Consider the following:{どんな・[何]{なん}の}映画を見ましたか。{どんな・何の}本を買いましたか。What is the difference in the type of information requested by the two interrogativesMy hypothesis is that 何の is used to request information from pool of discrete data, while どんな requests information from continuous data. (どんな is broader than 何の)That is to say that 何のX requests information from a set of established data; X has been categorised into discrete genres and it asks for which, while どんなX seems to be more open-ended.

I've never really understood how どうした works and hope someone can explain or point me towards further reading.For example, in my textbook, the following question is asked in relation to a short passage:母親の気持ちに対して、住友君はどうしましたか？The passage describes a young man, Sumitomo-kun, who from about the time he entered elementary school attended juku. The passage explains that because his mother felt the schools you attended were important to succeeding in life she sent him from this age despite thinking at some level that it was too early.The answer to this question seems to be in the following part:「心を鬼にして塾へ送り出してくれた」母親を喜ばせてやろうと、一生懸命勉強し、県下でも有数の公立の進学高校に入学。What I don't understand is why the question used どうした. Could it have used 何をした insteadMore broadly, what are the differences between the two questions

I've previously asked two separate questions regarding あっての, (and there's a third on here from Pacerier) and I thought I had it figured out, but then I found this sentence (from a JLPT practice book--my bold) that just throws me for a loop:山での遭難記事を読むたびに命あっての登山なのにと悲しく思う。Here's how I understand あっての, "B couldn't exist without A". For example: あなたあっての私なんです ==&gt; I wouldn't be here without youHere's how I understand this sentence: Every time I read an article about a disaster on the mountain, I think sadly "even though mountain climbing wouldn't exist without life!".This just doesn't make any sense to me, and I'm sure I have the meaning wrong.

My character dictionary is written in vertical style.  In this dictionary, columns of text are sometimes divided into two smaller columns, which are read right-then-left.  I've read that this is called 割注{わりちゅう}.  It looks like this:This says りんれつ.Sometimes, when there's only a single character in each column, it looks like horizontal writing: right-to-left.  Based on this experience, I figured any horizontal writing in the middle of vertical writing would be read right-to-left.However, on the first page of the novel 魔術{まじゅつ}はささやく, I came across this:I think it says 24.  But that would be left-to-right!  My intuition tells me it should be so, because they are not Chinese or Japanese characters.  But is this really correct  My experience with my dictionary tells me it might say 42 instead.  Which is itMore generally, how do I tell which way to read horizontal writing in the middle of vertical writing

Please consider 一段 {いちだん} verb 感じる {かんじる}. Sometimes I see particle に applied and sometimes particole を. In the Jisho.org vocabulary it is not specified if this verb is 他動詞 {たどうし} (transitive) or 自動詞 {じどうし} (intransitive).The examples I found are:生を感じる私は幸せに感じる将来に不安を感じるMy problem is, among the many examples, the fact that I found the second sentence, which is the only one using に.So I was thinking... maybe 感じる always wants particle を. In that particular sentence, possible, I have particle に to make noun 幸せ an adverb. Is it correct

In "Maiko Haaaan!!!", a bridge going over Yumekawa (a fictional river in Kyoto) apparently has "夢ノ橋" written on it, rather than "夢の橋". I had two theories about why that may be the case. One was that it was the name of something, and therefore might have different rules than normal Japanese, and the other was that the bridge was supposed to be old, and therefore the name was written in a Japanese different to what exists today.I checked "When is the katakana form of wo (ヲ) used", and this answer seemed the best match to the circumstances:The use of katakana ヲ is quite rare indeed; as you surmise, the use as  a particle is Hiragana in modern Japanese. In older dialects, Katakana  was used for particles as well, however, and you can see ヲ in use  there. In modern times, it's also occasionally used for ironic or  stylistic purposes, such as in ヲタク.Was の one of the particles that was sometimes written in katakana(Appearance of the bridge name: 夢ノ橋 (18 seconds into the youtube clip), and ノ appears in a non-fictional bridge 梅ノ橋)

What is the difference between うーん and ううんIn a comment on Pronunciation of ううん, paullb said that he usually sees the negative interjection ううん written as うーん.  This confused me, because I thought of ううん and うーん as different words, pronounced differently.I decided to look it up, but most of my dictionaries don't have entries for うーん.  I found one that did, though--the big Kenkyusha J-E dictionary.  According to that dictionary, ううん has three meanings.  The first is the "negative interjection" meaning, and the other two appear to be something else:ううん１【軽い否定】no; uh-huh; uh-unh.「朝ご飯はもう食べたの？」「〜まだだよ」 "Had breakfast yet"ー"Un-unh, not yet."2 【言いよどむとき、苦しいとき】 er; hmm; ugh; oof.「衝撃的なニュースに、彼は〜と言ってそれきり口をつぐんでしまった。」 At the shocking news he let out a groan [moan] and said no more.3 【感心したとき】 oh; aha; uh-uh.「そのリポートを読んで、学生の冷静な状況分析に教授は〜どうなった。」 When he read [upon reading] the essay, the professor murmured his approval of the student's objective analysis.Meanwhile, the entry for うーん looks like this:うーん　＝ううん 2,3.That doesn't include meaning 1, so I concluded that the negative interjection ううん and うーん are separate words.  (It also appears that うーん can be written ううん, but then it's not "the negative interjection ううん".)Based on paullb's comment, though, I'm not sure if this distinction holds up in practice.  Can anyone tell me if I'm on the right track  If I see うーん, could it mean "no"  If I see ううん, can that mean something other than "no"  How do I tell the difference(I left out a couple examples from the definition for ううん 2.  Hopefully that's okay.)
I know that -てみる can mean "try", but my understanding of it is that it means "try it and see what it's like" or "give it a try". But is there a way of expressing "try" that emphasizes that effort was made to succeedAs an example, saying "I am trying to do Kendo" in Japanese:剣道をしてみる。sounds like I'm going for a brief "trial" to see how I like it. How would I express that I am making a strong effort to succeed at it
How do I describe my height in centimetresI think you can say "私は背が高いです" to say that you're tall, but how about your exact height Would "私は背が１９０cmです" sound like broken JapaneseI came across someone using "身長: xyz cm" when describing their height, and looking up "example sentences" in jisho.org for "身長" had a few cases of it being used for exact heights.

I found this example sentence in "A Dictionary of Intermediate Japanese Grammar" under a grammar point unrelated to "とは限らない":"運動をよくする人が必ずしも長生きするとは限らない。"I understand the meaning of the sentence ("People who exercise a lot don't necessarily live a long time.") but I'm struggling to understand the logic behind this usage of "とは限らない". If this dictionary did not have an English translation I would think it meant "Living a long time is not just limited to people who exercise a lot" since "限る" means "to limit" in other contacts.Without the "とは限らない", the sentence means "People who exercise definitely live a long time." From my understanding of "必ずしも", you can say "長生きしない" instead of "長生きする" and it should also have the meaning "People who exercise a lot don't necessarily live a long time".So why is "とは限らない" used this way And bonus question, what is the semantic difference between "運動をよくする人が必ずしも長生きするとは限らない" and "運動をよくする人が必ずしも長生きしない"
The pitch contour of the interjection ううん has been described as high, low, middle.  Alternatively, it has been described as a falling-rising tone.  In either case, this appears to be unique in Japanese. In English, the pitch contour of "I donno" is distinctive.  I can reduce it to "ionno", "ionn", "nnn", or just hum the pitch contour without opening my mouth, and it's nevertheless understandable.Given that the pitch contour of ううん is unique, and given that it's already fairly nasal, can I do the same thing  Can I say んんん without opening my mouth at all  If so, is this the normal pronunciation

I read once (in this comment by Victor Mair on Language Log) that Chinese has single morphemes that span two hanzi.  The example given was the Chinese word pútáo 葡萄.  At the time, I assumed it applied to Japanese equally, because I assumed 葡萄{ぶどう} was the same word.  I then assumed I could generalize from that to similar compounds.  (In retrospect, I don't think that reasoning was very good, which is why I'm asking this question.)Other compounds that look like they might be monomorphemic include [薔薇]{ばら}, [蜘蛛]{くも}, and 麒麟{きりん}.Are any of these single morphemes  Pairs of bound morphemes  If these are bad examples, are there two-kanji compounds that are single morphemes

The example sentence in Why is も used instead of が in the sentence 「日本ではクモを見ると良いことがあると言う人もいますよ」, 日本ではクモを見ると良いことがあると言う人もいますよgot me thinking "Why is it using で, not に". I.e., why not日本には、クモを見ると良いことがあると言う人もいますよIt seems obvious that 日本では is intended to modify います. If it were modifying 言う, the meaning would be roughly "There are people who - when in Japan - say that ...".Although I would personally use に in this sentence, it doesn't sound completely ungrammatical to me as it is. So why is that, given that いる usually takes に, not で
私は彼が自慢だ。I'm Proud of Him彼は私が自慢だ。He is proud of me.I am confused by this pattern with 自慢. It kind of looks like 自慢 is being used as an adjective (), but the definition in Tangorin lists it as:noun / noun or participle with aux. verb する → conjugation / noun with genitive case particle のPerhaps 私は彼が自慢だ can be more literally translated as "He is my pride."So if I dissect it--私は I (topic marker) 彼が he (subject/object marker) 自慢だ pride is. ()Along this line of reasoning, does 私は自慢だ。mean "I am proud." 　I guess I am getting confused because I see the first sentence listed and then think of a pattern like this: 私は彼がきれいだと思います。-- "I think that he is pretty."(Where the が connects 彼 to きれい)Would anyone be kind enough to explain this pattern with 自慢 and maybe show a few more examples like itFor instance, these examples make more sense to me, though perhaps the English expressions do not seem to correlate as easily:美人の妻が彼の自慢だ。    His beautiful wife is his pride.彼女は水泳が自慢だ。 She prides herself on her swimming.

Inspired by the Wikipedia page on Kangxi radicals I decided to study the meaning and writing of radicals before I tackle the much more numerous kanji. But in working my way through the list, I started doubting the translations of the radicals. Looking closer at the cited sources, I found them to contradict each other at several occasions. 癶 is translated as "foot steps" as well as "dotted tent", 冂 is translated as "down box", "upside down box" and "display case". These are only two examples out of many more contradictions. Is there any reliable source to the meaning of kangxi radicals I really want to learn the meaning of the radicals, but at this pace I don't even know where to start. Can we find a reliable source, as well as an indication to why it is reliable Any help would be appreciated!

As far as I can tell, if you want to say something like "Would you..." or "Why don't you..", it's common to say something like "食べるのだろうか？". I looked it up and as I far as I can tell it's short form+の to make it a noun, and then だろう which is the volitional of だ... this is after a lot of Googling around and I'm still kind of confused, since I haven't even heard the volitional mentioned in my class yet. Please tell me if that's right.If I understand Wikipedia correctly, you could also say "食べようか？". First off, is that conjugating it right; second, is that something you would say; finally, how is it different from -の+だろうThanks for any help.
Apologies for the very vague question. I'm unsure of how I'm supposed to address and talk to children - I imagine it varies a little depending on the social situation, and in general I should avoid potentially awkward language as much as I should around adults, but does anyone have any broad guidelines A few particular things I might fret about:Should I address a child I don't know with 君【きみ】 If I know their name, is [surname]+君【くん】 / +ちゃん usualPresumably I should generally use plain verb forms rather than polite verb forms. Does this change if I'm talking about their family members or similar (or indeed ever) Is it usual to give commands with ください, ～なさい, くれ or just plain ～て form (I'm unsure of whether なさい is too blunt - my intuition about this word is that it's one used when the speaker is in the same social hierarchy as the listener, but higher up. This probably applies if I am a teacher or a parent, but not if I meet them in the street.)Do I refer to their family members as お父【とう】さん, etc.If I give them something, do I あげる it to them or やる (The latter feels rather blunt to me.) If I talk about someone else giving them something, do they あげる, やる, くれる or くださる it (I would guess くれる sometimes occurred in the case of very young children - though this doesn't feel like a linguistic issue! - but otherwise あげる or やる according to what the 'giver' would describe it as)At what point does a child become an adult (in the sense of addressing them with さん and/or using polite verb forms)(A final, less general question. I tend to use 僕【ぼく】 to refer to myself, but have heard of adults referring to young boys like this. Would this be confusing How should I refer to myself)(The context is that I (male, mid-20s) encountered a young (8-ish) Japanese boy yesterday - actually, he spent 45 minutes thrashing me all over a goban - and would have liked to exchange a few words of congratulation, but as his father was present I was a little nervous. I wasn't sure whether using forms like ～なさい and やる would have implied I thought very highly of my own social status, but I also wasn't sure whether using forms like ～ください and あげる was a little heavy towards a young boy, who may never have been spoken to directly like that. Still, I'd be very interested to see the question answered from a general perspective.)

When eating ramen, a Japanese person commented on how the ramen of this shop are 丁寧.What does 丁寧 means in the context of food  丁寧 means polite in social contexts, but I am not sure it the same kanji/word, and I know no concept of polite food.Google has tons of results for 丁寧な寿司 or 丁寧なラーメン, so I am sure there is a precise meaning.See also these 丁寧 breads.
What is the general etiquette about about using the newer characters （新字体） or even a more modern version of the old character (旧字体） when used in names Is it generally considered rudeFor example, my partner's family name is 濵 which is often somewhat problematic to type into a computer and so I often see it just replaced with 濱 (you might have to look close to see the difference) or sometimes even with the new character, 浜.
I looked up 塞 in my 漢和辞典, and I found four readings:音：サイ、ソク訓：とりで、ふさ・ぐWhat I noticed is that サイ is used when the kanji means とりで, and ソク is used when the kanji means ふさぐ:「とりで」の意味：　要塞{ようさい}・[防塞]{ぼうさい}「ふさぐ」の意味：　閉塞{へいそく}・[逼塞]{ひっそく}I noticed the same thing with 省.  The reading セイ seems to be used when the kanji means かえりみる, while ショウ is reserved for the other meanings.What is the historical reason for this sort of correspondence  Does it mean 塞 was borrowed twice, with a different pronunciation and meaning  Was 塞 confused with 寨, perhaps  What about 省
How can I tell whether 捻る is read as ひねる (P. ・ N.C.) or ねじる (P. ・ N.C.)I assume the answer is "based on which verb is appropriate", so I've been trying to learn the difference between them.  Based on the links above, here's what I've got so far:They both generally refer to twisting.  There are cases where it could be read either way, because the meanings overlap:　「体を捻る・水道の栓を捻る・足を捻った」When you put a lot of force into twisting, it's ねじる.  So you use ねじる when you're opening a bottle by (forcibly) twisting the cap off:　「びんのふたをねじって開ける」If you're twisting something with your fingers or fingertips, you use ひねる: 「ひげをひねる・スイッチをひねる・鶏をひねる」Metaphoric uses appear to use ひねる: 「頭をひねる・ひねった質問」Does this seem correct
According to WWWJDIC,ぬるい and ぬくい are both written 温い. Anthy and the iOS Japanese input systems agree. However a native speaker and the input of an electronic dictionary (広辞苑）say that 温い is read as ぬくい and means pleasantly lukewarm.微温い is read as ぬるい and means "not warm enough" lukewarm.There is a note in WWWJDIC acknowledging 微温い yet Anthy and iOS do not offer 微温い as an option for ぬくい or ぬるい.I suppose I should be aware of all these different variations but is there an "official" position on 温い, 微温い, ぬくい and ぬるいDoes "微温い" have an alternative reading (e.g. that Anthy would map to 微温い)
I've never really understood why there is a difference between 髪の毛 and 毛　when talking about hair on one's body. What is it about 髪 that makes it only relevant in the context of having "hair on the head" Why wouldn't I be able to call hair 髪の毛 if it was in a different area

In my everyday conversations when trying to confirm an understanding or recall a piece of information I am sure I had heard before, I often use （そう）だっけ、だったっけ、and でしたっけ when speaking to equals or 目下の人。 But when talking to 目上の人 I'm never quite sure what the equivalent expression would be. I know that でしたっけ can be used with 目上の人 depending on your relationship and the situation, but I am trying to find out if there is a polite(r) equivalent※.So far I've been given ～かね as a candidate from a native speaker. But since it was the only candidate and it doesn't carry the feeling of "trying to remember" I am inclined to think that there is no polite equivalent. On top of that, depending on the situation and listener, it could be taken like you are doubting the other person, being condescending, or lack class（品）。Here is the site I got that from.So, to sum up my questions: Is there a polite equivalent※ to っけ and if so, what is it If not, what do people say when trying to recall a piece of information that they are sure they once had when in a situation where they should use keigo※By equivalent I mean carries the same nuance and feeling, not just in meaning as in "can be used to form a question."Let me give some examples so I can explain the way the words "feel" as I understand them.The different meanings may or may not require different intonations. Also, I am not going to exhaust all options.これはあなたの車だっけ？1) Trying to remember if this is his car or not.2) Expressing disbelief that this is his car. Both very casual.これはあなたの車でしたっけ？1) Same as above, but more polite. However, I highly doubt a regular worker (please assume properly educated, polite person) would say this to their 部長. This is the reason I posted this question.これはあなたの車ですよね？1) Expressing conviction that I know this is your car, but I want confirmation2) Could also be used accusatorially(I think there would be a split opinion about whether this could be used with a 部長)これはあなたの車ですかね？1) Used to ask a plain old question2) Could sound like I'm being condescending3) Could sound like I doubt the validity of their claim4) Could sound accusatoryこれはあなたの車でしょうか？1) Used to ask a plain old question2) Could be used to get confirmation3) Could be used to express doubt  The point is that none of these are equivalents in terms of nuance and feeling, or even usage other than the fact that they modify the conveyed feeling and intent of questions.

So I was wondering, how do japanese people greet each other when they are, for example, writing on a blog or recording a video My doubt comes from the fact that their greetings will be directed towards someone who is unknown, and that the greeting will be seen on a unpredictable time. Someone who accesses the blog (or watches the video or whatever) could to that at anytime of the day. Does that even matter Or one should take into consideration the time when they're are writing/recording Or neither
In the English Wiktionary entry for "を" there is a quote or example sentence using the character "乎" with no explanation seemingly where the particle "を" would normally occur.Now I couldn't find anything in either the entry for "乎" or "を" about them being historically connected via man'yōgana, and Google searches failed to turn up anything conclusive either.In fact I don't know much about man'yōgana at all so could it be that any character with the right reading could be used for "を"
As discussed in this question, one meaning for じき is "soon, momentarily". Looking it up in my (English/Japanese) dictionary, I found both the kanjis 時期 and 直 for it.I looked them up further (online), and could only find the meaning of まっすぐであること for 直{じき}. Is my dictionary misleading meFrom just what I've seen, it seems like it's rarely written in kanji, and it makes sense in my head that the kanji for 直{す}ぐ would be used, so this question is more academic than practical, but I'd still appreciate any insight on it.

Are snowclones common in JapaneseA snowclone is a neologism for a type of cliché and phrasal template  originally defined as "a multi-use, customizable, instantly  recognizable, time-worn, quoted or misquoted phrase or sentence that  can be used in an entirely open array of different variants".An example of a snowclone is "grey is the new black", a version of the  template "X is the new Y". X and Y may be replaced with different  words or phrases – for example, "comedy is the new rock 'n' roll".  The term "snowclone" can be applied to both the original phrase and to  any new phrase that uses its formula. Many Internet memes are  snowclones: for example, the meme "obvious troll is obvious" has been  generalized to many other statements of the form "X Y is X".If I use snowclones myself, am I likely to be understood (all other things being equal), or will it just cause confusionEDIT: To expand a bit on the definition given above, a snowclone is a phrase pattern cliche. Unlike most cliches which use the same words every time, a snowclone is a cliche whose parts can be replaced to make a new (but recognizable) cliche. The term was requested, and eventually coined mainly for terms journalists use."X is the new Y" is a comment on fads/fashions, indicating that "everyone who was excited/worried about X is excited about Y now", regardless of what domain X and Y are in. (It's not limited to pop culture, I've heard "Portugal is the new Greece" in reference to the EU's economic issues)

A: 百均に入ると、何もいらなくても何か買わないと気が済まない人っているんだよね。B: いるいる。僕だよ。A: At the dollar store, there is always somebody who has to buy something even if they don't need it.B: Yes, yes! That's me.I am told that 気が済まない means  "won't be satisfied unless," or when one "must (do something)."If I translate the expression literally I get confused--気 spirit/mood/feelingが済まない finish;  come to an end;  excusable;  need notWould anyone be kind enough to give me a clear and thorough explanation of this expression I think my main confusion is as to which verb 済まない comes from.
This should be a rather straightforward (if a bit specific) bit of translation, but I cannot find a form that makes sense to me and gets corroborated by Google.How would one translate the typical phrase structure:Send him up/over [to the nth floor, to my office etc]Such as spoken to an office receptionist over the phone, to ask them to have a visitor go up to a certain floor/office.More specifically, I am wondering what verbal form would be appropriate. My two inclinations were to go with either:渡してください... but I am pretty sure this could only apply to an object, not people.Or:行かせてください... but this sounds more like "allow them/me to go" than "have them go" (and so do most usage examples I can find in Google).Does anybody know what the definite way of expressing this would be
I have about a semester of Japanese under my belt, so my ability to read the language is 'not great,' especially when it comes to getting any kind of nuance out of a statement. At the moment, I'm working on translating:一人でも多くの方にコメントしていただけたら嬉しいのでMy current attempts to parse this:一人 でも 多くの    - One person, but, many, (no) -- "But many individual's..."  Maybe Perhaps the de is part of the first word: 一人で も 多くの - By oneself/voluntarily, more/again, many (nominalized)  -- "In the future, voluntarily [do something repeatedly]..."方 に  - From what I can tell, the likely candidates are for 方 are for it to be pronounced 'hou' and to mean 'direction,' or for it to be pronounced 'kata' and either mean 'direction' or possibly be a way to say 'lady' or gentleman.' The latter seems likely enough, given that the person who wrote this is apparently prone to such word uses.コメント して いただけたら 嬉しいので  - comments, by/as, to be good/exquisite or 'potentially receive', happySo my feeble attempt to read this settles on something like: "I would be happy if you ladies and gentleman were to voluntarily leave more comments in the future."If anyone more seasoned can offer their translation, I'd be much obliged. Any commentary on how to parse the original statement would surely be enlightening.
Sometimes I think it's more obvious when to use 〜的 as a suffix for example 国家 "nation/state" vs 国家的 "national", but in a lot of other cases I think the distinction might be more blurred, and they frequently translate to the same word in English. For example (probably not a complete list):一時（的）"temporarily"自動（的）"automatic"国際（的）"international"理想（的）"ideal"一般（的）"general"直接（的）"direct"絶対（的）"absolute"標準（的）"standard"Is there a common pattern where to use/not use 的 on the end of these kinds of words For example, in the following sentences taken from the Tanaka corpus, is there any difference between their usage, and can they be interchangedそのような国際協力が素晴らしい成果を挙げた。  Such international cooperation was productive of great results.京都は景色が美しい点で国際的にも有名です。  Kyoto is internationally famous for its scenic beauty.10年前だったら彼の理論も一般的に認められるということはなかったでしょう。  Ten years ago his theory would not have been generally accepted.この教会は教会一般の大きさからすると大きなものではない。  This church is not a big one, as churches go.Does 的 always make a noun an adjective or are there cases where it's used for other purposes (For example there seems to be 直接的に as well as 直接に, and they're both listed as adj-na in Edict, and 絶対に and 絶対的に which I think have different usages etc).

From the question: "How does the use of いかんによっては in this question determine one answer over another", it is observed that:The use of によって means to change state or behaviour depending on, or according to something. It expresses variety.The use of によっては pinpoints one outcome from a range of possible outcomes.While the previous question deals with appropriate usage determination, this question seeks to understand the underlying principle governing it.(Question) Why does the presence of は do this, and how does this link back to what we know of はWhat I typically know of the particle は, is that it is a disambiguative particle and has thematic and contrastive roles.

When talking about the body part (not, for example, entrances/exits), what is the difference between these two words. Based on looking at these two pages (for 口 and 口元) I'm guessing that the difference is that 口元 deals with the outside part of your mouth, i.e. the lips, the shape of the mouth etc, while 口 deals with the "whole package" so to speak (the inside of the mouth, the tongue, the words/language one uses). Am I right on this Can these two ever be used interchangeably Are there other parts of the body that work (grammatically) the same way　(I tried 鼻元, but I got "root of the nose", which doesn't make sense to me...)
I found this word today, and I thought it was pretty interesting. I read it in the context of "becoming and adult", or "coming of age", but I'd like to know the etymology of it. I could only find definitions for the word itself, not its origins. At first blush it looks like "one person before/ahead", but it also seems like 人前 can mean a portion of food. "One person's portion of food" (Perhaps someone is now big enough to have an adult's portions)
This is a sentence from my JLPT prep book:新{あたら}しい首相{しゅしょう}に代{か}わったが、景気{けいき}は回復{かいふく}する　（　　）、悪化{あっか}する一方{いっぽう}であった。The answer is: ものか, but I thought it was どころか.I can't figure out why どころか isn't correct or is unnatural.

Is it a mistake to write 麒麟 if I mean giraffe  What about キリン if I mean QilinMy guess is that キリン giraffe should not be written with kanji, because it differs from their original meaning, while 麒麟 Qilin could be written either way.  I also guess this because animal names tend to be written in katakana.  Is this guess correct(What about the beer, Kirin)

The English language article on geisha saysApprentice geisha are called maiko (舞子 or 舞妓), literally "dance  child") or hangyoku (半玉), "half-jewel" (meaning that they are paid  half of the wage of a full geisha), or by the more generic term  o-shaku (御酌), literally "one who pours (alcohol)".and later on saysThe only modern maiko that can apprentice before the age of eighteen  are in Kyoto. So on average, Tokyo hangyoku (who typically begin at  18) are slightly older than their Kyoto counterparts (who usually  start at 15).Is 舞妓 used in all of Japan, or does the term for apprentice geisha vary from dialect to dialect, just like the word for geisha can be 芸者 or 芸子 depending on dialect Alternatively, are 舞妓 and 半玉 now considered distinct terms describing different concepts

Improve this question                    One aspect of studying Japanese that has greatly frustrated me is my university's lack of writing classes. Learning kanji, vocab, grammar and an academic or other style is important, but Japanese rhetoric at its core is also structured differently than that of English.For example, I remember learning how to write an essay in English for the first time. The teacher showed us that formula everyone knows: introductory paragraph with a thesis, supporting paragraphs, and a conclusion that restates the thesis.Formulaic writing like this gets old, of course, but the basic idea is adhered to pretty well in English writing. State your thesis and support it. The first time I read an essay in Japanese, it was from some 社会学 study thing from a 東大 professor. It was designed to help Japanese students pass entrance exams. It was useful in some ways, but it was also very frustrating. I was frustrated because the author would say things like "I hope you found the thesis. It was right there, in that third paragraph. There's something wrong if you couldn't find it." I'd reread the passage over and over again but it was always difficult for me to understand the structure of the writing. "Of course I couldn't find it. Why is it in the third paragraph!"A Japanese person told me once that they structure their rhetoric opposite ours, saying that we put the thesis first and they put the thesis last. I think that is probably an oversimplification. My wife has been doing some interesting cultural studies and has led me to field of contrastive rhetoric; this article for example looks like a promising help to understanding. All three of the listed Japanese rhetorical structures would be very difficult for an English reader to understand.I want to know some good resources to polish my writing skills in Japanese. It would be nice if there were something in English, similar to this Korean textbook, simply because it would be able to highlight the contrastive structure between English/Japanese writing styles. But something in Japanese is great, too (I remember seeing writing books at The Daiso, but something else would be nice). Perhaps there is a popular kokugo textbook for college/high school students

I encountered the following sentence in a comic book which I could not make sense of.The comic strip depicts a character using a simple bird trap and saying:「長年やってるけどかかったためしないなあ」The first part, 長年やってるけど, can be roughly translated as "I've been doing this for quite a while", and this is quite clear.The second part, かかったためしない, is not clear.My guess is that it means something like "Catching is not the reason I'm doing this." The dictionary shows that かかる can be translated as "to catch (prey)" and I know that ため can be an "intention" and する is "do". However, I feel I may be wrong here, especially since it's all written in hiragana.Some help would be appreciated.

In my JLPT practise book, I have the following question:A：噂にまどわされる＿＿＿＿＿、とは言うものの・・・。B：つい、信じちゃうよね。べく　2.べき　3.べからざる　4. べからずI knew the answer was between 3 and 4, but I couldn't make a final decision on why I would choose one over the other. According to the book, the answer is 4.According to the book's explanation, at least as I understand it, べからざる means something can't be allowed, and べからず means something must not happen.However, both have a certain amount of logical sense in the question above. Assuming I understand it correctly (which I probably don't), it's either saying "we can not allow ourselves to be deceived by rumours", or "we can't be deceived by rumours", depending on whether we use べからざる or べからず.What is the difference that I'm not seeing
I looked up both 沙 and 砂 in my 学研{がっけん} 漢和辞典{かんわじてん} today.  It appears that they share the same list of readings (サ、シャ、すな、いさご).  I also see that some words can be written with either kanji.  Here are the senses my dictionary lists for 沙:すなはら。「[沙漠]{さばく}」すな。いさご。水で洗い分けて取り除く。「[沙汰]{さた}」The dictionary goes on to say that meanings 1 and 2 are normally written with 砂.  That makes sense to me--I've never seen すな or さばく written 沙 or 沙漠.  (Of course, I'm only a student.)So then, where the meanings overlap, is 砂 always used  I looked for the answer online, and I found a claim that 沙 to mean sand or desert is mostly used in China, while 砂 is mostly used in Japan.  Is this true  Is there any distinction in meaning between e.g. 沙漠 and 砂漠  Are there times when I should write these words with 沙I started wondering when I saw how highly ranked 沙 was in the 文化庁 漢字出現頻度表 (Agency for Cultural Affairs kanji frequency list), but I fear I've misled myself.

What is the role of 空書{くうしょ} in modern Japanese  空書 is tracing characters in the air with your finger (or on a flat surface), a phenomenon which apparently develops only in users of Chinese characters.  It's something I've found myself doing, as well.  (My self-study has a heavy emphasis on writing by hand.)I've read that 空書 functions as a memory aid for kanji, allowing you to recall characters via kinetic memory.  Personally, I often find it's easier to trace a character than to picture it in my mind.  It also seems to help me remember readings when I trace a vaguely familiar kanji, though I'm not sure whether that's confirmation bias--did I remember because of kinetic memory, or because I spent extra time focusing on the character in question  I'm not sure I should trust my own judgment.With that said, the research I found on 空書 does seem to be a bit dated, and I've also read about the development of character amnesia, which makes me wonder if what I read is still valid.  I'm curious if 空書 continues to play a role in modern Japanese, with the advent of typing replacing writing by hand.  Are people losing the ability to access characters by kinetic memory  Is 空書 disappearingIf it still does play a role, what is that role  Is it useful when typing  Reading  Communicating kanji in speech  No longer useful at all
In my JLPT practise book, in a section explaining the use of いかんによっては, which roughly means "depending on", they have the following question:学生{がくせい}：先生{せんせい}、台風{たいふう}が近{ちか}づいていますね。明日{あした}のゼミは休講{きゅうこう}ですか？先生{せんせい}：そうですね。台風{たいふう}のコースいかんによっては______A: 休{やす}みです。　B:　決{き}めましょう。I chose the answer B, thinking it roughly meant, "We will decide depending on the course of the typhoon."However, according to the book, the correct answer is A, which is translated as, "depending on the path it might be a holiday." (The English translations in this book are not so smooth.)Both make logical sense to me, but, despite what the book says, I can't help but feel that B makes more sense because the path of the typhoon is uncertain, and therefor so is the decision about the seminar. Thus, "let's wait and decide."Why is A the correct answer
From this sentence I read:これらの手法はクリティカルセクションが（例えば100μ秒以内などの）一定時間以内に終わるよう精密にプログラミングすることを要求する。How am I supposed to pronounce μ秒  Should I pronounce it as "mu byou" or "micro byou" I also looked up μm (micrometer) and found that it is マイクロメートル. I found a few other ones that are just loanwords like マイクロアンペア for μA. Can this convention be applied to 秒 as well Is there a convention to use with other measurements too For example "pico", "nano", "femto"
I read the word 「引き金」and the definition is:１ 小銃・ピストルなどの、指で引く発射装置の金具。２ ある事態を引き起こす直接の原因。きっかけ。「授業料の値上げが―となって大学紛争が起こった」  起因(きいん) 　⇒類語辞書で詳しい使い方を調べる  誘因(ゆういん) 動機(どうき) モチーフBut why is 金 connected to the meaning of "trigger" How is "pulling money"「引き金」representative of a "gun" or "trigger"
The だけ meaning "only", and で being the "at/in" particle. When saying "only in/at", does the で　come before, or after the だけ What does it mean, if anything, when it's reversedExample: "You can only get this plush toy in Japan". Is it,このぬいぐるみを日本だけで手に入れます。orこのぬいぐるみを日本でだけ手に入れます。Side note: does the same principle apply to しか
According to jisho.org, they all have the same meanings, to climb, to rise, to ascend. Is that true And do they have differences in usage
My question is on 「あれから１０数年」.  My understanding is that this translates to roughly, "It's been 10 years since then."The dictionary says「数年」 means "several years" or "a number of years".  How does the meaning differ from「あれから１０年後」, and why would you use 「数年」when using a specific number
I'm trying to figure out what 血のションベン means.  I understand the individual words and literal meaning.  So assuming it doesn't mean "bloods urine", what does this meanPerhaps the full sentance is important in this case:「私が最初に血のションベンを流した」If you search for this phrase, just as is with the katakana 「ションベン」 you'll find numerous hits online. I seem to always see it associated with 「流す」.Here's another example, which I found online: 「女性にこんなこと言うのもあれなんやけどな、先生らの時代は　血のションベン（小便）だすまで勉強しろてようゆわれたもんやで」
After reading @jkerian's comment in this post, I started thinking about this.  Here's the comment in full:On a side note, all days ending in '4' are also irregular, and use ~よっか. So the 14th is じゅう・よっか, the 24th is に・じゅう・よっか, even though all the other days &gt;10 switch over to ~にちObviously the most calendar days is 31, but does this rule apply if I want to refer to the 34th day  Or 84  Or any number of day that ends in 4  Or twenty (はつか - ２０日)  Or do these rules only apply to so-called "calendar" speakI realize there are probably better ways of saying such things, but here are some examples:事故から４４日目　→　The 44th day since the accident.  （よんじゅう・よっか・め　or　よんじゅう・よ（ん）にち・め）裁判長は犯人に120日間の[懲役]{ちょう・えき}を申し渡した。　→　The judge sentenced the criminal to 120 days in prison.  (ひゃく・はつか・かん　or　ひゃく・にじゅうにち・かん)宇宙探査機が2374日間で往復した。　→　The spacecraft made its round-trip in 2374 days. (にせん・さんびゃく・ななじゅう・よっか・かん　or　にせん・さんびゃく・ななじゅう・よ（ん）にち・かん）
This might seem like a ridiculous question, but I heard from a native that there is an emphasis when using 「大の好物」 instead of 「大好物」. Is this true If this is so, why would 「大＋の」 indicate more emphasis on something "more" or "larger" compared to just placing 「大」 in front of the wordCan we do this with other words than just 「大」
I learnt from my teacher that the days of the month from 1 to 10 use kun and irregular pronunciations:一日: ついたち (irregular)二日: ふつか (kun)三日: みっか (kun)...十日: とおか (kun)But for words like 一日目, 二日間 and 三日間後, what would be the correct pronunciation and the rules for thisI heard 一日目 is いちにちめ and 三日間後 is みっかかんあと. Is this correct
Looking at the individual kanji according to a dictionary:丈 means height, stature, length夫 means husband, man大 means big, greatThey seem unrelated to what these words using the kanji mean:丈夫 means healthy, strong大丈夫 means safe, all right, okayHow did these words end up with these meanings

At What is 方 used for (when attached to a た-verb), I wrote that the 早く there means "early":早く行った方が良かったでしょう。  It would have been better if (you) had gone early, would it notBut I'm wondering whether that was correct. In the case of e.g. 早く行ったほうがいいよ。How can you tell if it means "it'd be better if you go quickly", "it'd be better if you go early" or "it'd be better if you go soon"If the answer is "by context", if possible please give examples of contexts where one or the other is the case.
Here is a part of a sentence from my book:・・・・手裏剣をよけざま・・・・I can't find any help in any of my references on the pattern of "masu-stem + ざま", which makes me hesitant to say that's exactly what it is, but I also can't figure out anything else it could be. From what it looks like to me it says "(he) dodged the shuriken", and I want to say that that "ざま" is 様, meaning "state" (and without the kanji I'm assuming it's "よけ" as in the masu-stem of "避ける" meaning "to avoid").Am I right about the formation of this phrase Can anyone add/correct anything
I'm looking through a book of go problems, and ran across the following sentence accompanied by the problem diagram:隅の黒一子が次にアタリですが、ここをどう考えるかですA rough translation is relatively simple, along the lines of "Black's single stone in the corner is 1 move away from atari (technical term), what do you think about this position" (By implication: how should black play to survive)The go problem is relatively simple. The bit that confused me was the か landing before the です in this question. What does this mean and how does it affect the sentence
This question spawns from the comments here. I've heard that オタク could or could not be derogatory. During the times I've been in Japan and heard it used, I didn't think that it had any connotation of being an insulting term, but is this true I'm not sure about other countries, but in America as a borrowed word, many people are proud to be called an "オタク" depending on the circumstance. Is it not the same in Japan
They both seem to mean "parallel".  In my プログレッシブ dictionary, it seems to point to the former being the more mathematical sense of the definition (two co-planar, non-intersecting lines), while the latter indicates a more metaphorical definition (doing things at the same time, parallel computing, etc.).However, my 大辞泉 has the following:平行：「並行（へいこう）②」に同じ。（並行② is the metaphorical definition)So which is it  Are they distinct like プログレッシブ says, or does 平行 encompass 並行 like 大辞泉 says
An answer to "What is the most natural way to refer to someone when you don't know their name and don't have a close relationship with them" suggests that お宅 may be used to refer to the second person.When is (or was) the use of お宅 appropriate Because rikaikun defines お宅 as:your house; your home; your family; your husband; your organisation; you (referring to someone of equal status with whom one is not especially close)There is some conflict with the fact that the answer to the other question was voted down.

I tried looking up what 「コミュニケーションがとれる」 means, but from the examples that I've seen, all I can understand is that it just means "to communicate".

This clause is from a book that I'm reading called "日本人が知らない世界の歩き方". It's the first clause of the first sentence in the book and coincidentally the first one that I'm having trouble with. In particular, there are two things that I don't understand:What does the を before 歩く mean How is it possible for an intransitive verb to have an を particle If this usage of the particle を is different than its usage as a direct object, can you please explain this alternate usage in depthWhat does it mean for のは to be preceded by a verb in the past tense I understand that  when の follows a present tense verb, it forms an infinitive or gerund (i.e. 歩くの = to run or running), but I don't understand what this means when it is applied to a verb in the past tense.*edit: I just learned from the particle-wo tag that the particle can sometimes mean the course of a motion verb. So 外国を歩く means "walk around a foreign country" or "traverse a foreign country" What English preposition is a good approximation for this particle And is 歩く meant to literally mean "to walk", or is it a more general type of motion like "to traverse"
I need to know what しかりだ does mean. I couldn't find over internet a satisfactory meaning.It is from a manga called Saint Seiya.

But I don't understand what he is saying about silver and bronze saints, because that last word しかりだ.

I have tried to ask people this type of question on many occasions and the answer is always the same, but people are notoriously bad at evaluating their own language, so I ask here: Apart for pitch, which I know will differ significantly from region to region, what kinds of phonetic or phonological differences are there between the different dialects of Japanese, particularly between Kansai and Tokyo For instance, I'm always told that if a person from Osaka spoke with Standard Pitch Accent, they would sound exactly like a person from Tokyo, that there is essentially no other difference. Except I know there are slight differences, such as with devoicing. Does anyone know more about thisEDIT: I'd like to be more specific. In a context where a native speaker of Kansaiben says a word or phrase that either sounds the same in standard Japanese, or where he happens to use standard Japanese, provided he gets the pitch right, are there typically any sounds that would tend to be pronounced differently and that would give away that person as a non-native speaker of Tokyouben, for instanceIf an American from New York and another from New Orleans say the same phrase they are unlikely to sound the same, even if they naturally used the exact same words. I'm wondering if the same concept of "accent" can apply to the pronunciation of particular sounds within Japanese dialects, specifically Kansaiben.
I am trying to understand whether the ruby text in ancient scripture is essential to the meaning of a verse, or if the scripture can be understood without it.  For instance, can this verse:be understood equally well without the ruby text, like this:
Could someone explain why we use 楽しめそう instead of 楽しそう in the first sentence and what exactly 楽しみ means and why (The translations are my best guess at what the sentences might mean.)この本は高いことは高いが、写真が多くて楽しめそうだ。  It is true this book is expensive but it has lots of photos and looks like fun.子供を育てるのは大変なことは大変だが、成長が楽しみで大変さを忘れる。  Bringing up children is hard work terrible but you forget that because you look forward to when they grow up.

I know this is dangerously close to a translation question, but bare with me.Today I found out a co-worker of mine is studying Japanese as well. And at the end of the conversation I wrote: Jikan wa deru koto desu. Which, as far as I know, means: It's time to leave. One, is this correct Two, when translating infinitives from English to Japanese is the proper conversion: to [verb] -&gt; [verb] koto
On the subject of real-time OS's, I read this sentence:割り込みを一時的に不可(マスク)とする。Where 不可 apparently means "to mask". I can understand that "割り込み masks something", but I can't understand "不可とする" The definition of 不可 that I looked up was "wrong, bad, improper, inadvisable". So, what does "不可とする" mean in this context
Note: Edits in response to comments have been added in italicsThe sentence prompting this question is:時下ますますご清栄のことと、お喜び申し上げますWhich I have always "loosely" taken to mean:I am glad to hear you are doing so well these days.Based on the explanation of と　on page 464 of "A dictionary of intermediate Japanese Grammar", I think there is an ellipsis of 伺いまして, and hence is quotive but I am not entirely sure.But to return to my question, when is 「だ／である」required between a noun and the quotation particle と:There some straight forward cases that are easy to remember such as (1)with names (2) direct quotes and (3)"fixed expressions"　such as "とばかり”:(1) Tim と言います| I am called Tim　(2)「＿＿＿＿」と言います。｜normal direct quote　(3)負けじとばかりゴールを目ざして走った｜Determined not to be beaten, he dashed toward the goal.I also found the advice in the Dictionary of Basic Jpse Grammar that in the sentence:米国の貿易赤字は  しばらくのまま  続く  もの  と  予想される。It is predicted that the US trade deficit will remain as it is for a while."Mono followed by a quotative と is used in general statements or opinion. This mono could be dropped without a change in meaning. Note that copula だ does not follow と."But when making my own sentences of indirect quotes (etc) it is not so straightforward because I am not sure what rule/principle applies.Could somebody some insight on when the copula (だ）particle と　go together(If sentence 3 is based on the same principle as sentence 2 then perhaps I have covered all the expceptions)

Edit: This question has been reworded as much as possible from the original to try to make it a question about Japanese. Also, adding the IME単漢字辞書 fixed the IME problem (thanks to Tsuyoshi Ito for pointing that out). Quote about 単漢字辞書: Microsoft IME単漢字辞書には、マクロソフトで読みが確認できたJIS第三・第四水準漢字が登録されています. However, it looks like 鎗 is part of JIS第一水準漢字, so I still don't understand that part.If I look in the dictionary, やり has three versions: 槍／鎗／鑓 (I understand they are not standard).When I type やり, my windows IME shows me the following:QuestionWhy is 鎗 not on the list It seems 鎗 is considered to be different than 槍 and 鑓. What is special about the character 鎗CLARIFICATION ON ENCODINGS AND IME DICTIONARIESMS IMEs 標準辞書 is based on jis x 0208 which includes JIS第1水準漢字 and JIS第2水準漢字. 鎗 is part of JIS第1水準 and this is why it comes out why you type そう with the default dictionary on MS IME. 単漢字辞書 is a separate dictionary based on JIS X 0213 which includes 第3水準漢字 and 第4水準漢字, if you add it, it shows 鎗 in the 変換リスト when you type やり. Now, why exactly this behavior occurs to me is a mystery (perhaps its just a bug), but I know that other dictionaries for other non-microsoft IMEs do not exhibit this behavior. I am assuming this is because they include all characters in the BMP and do not divide things up according to shift-jis taxonomy. Also, perhaps the dictionary implementors decided that 鎗 is 異体字, so they left it out.

Is there any general idea of what percentage of loan words come from which languages I always thought the majority of them came from English, but I keep seeing more and more that originated in Germany and Portugal.
I am currently studying kanji by using a number of sites, some of which provide mnemonics to aid in learning. While not a specific radical per se (I think), the top portions of the following characters, 恋, 変, and 湾 are often thought of as a simplification of the character for red: 赤. Thus there are mnemonics provided for kanji like those mentioned that use this idea of "red."However, http://www.kanjinetworks.com states that the etymology of this (quasi-)radical is as follows:䜌 (Type 1 Phonetic) is 絲 (糸 thread doubled, a character now subsumed in 糸) + 言 words (in its original sense of making verbal distinctions → distinguish) → make tangled threads distinct by stretching and untangling them.In other words, rather than "red,"  it is in fact a simplification of an archaic character related to the "thread" radical, 糸.I am interested to know if this is correct, and how native Japanese perceive or conceptualize this (quasi-)radical--as being related to 糸, 赤 or something altogether different.For example, here is the whole entry from the site on the kanji 変 :変 (9)       ヘン      か（える・わる）        Formerly 變As per 䜌 (Type 5 Phonetic) as described in 恋 (tangled) + 攵 action indicator → an attempt to untangle a volatile situation, that leads to change → unusual; unusual/wondrous event; political event; internal disturbance.
I was wondering if there's a difference in usage between 神様がいる and 神様がある. In both cases, I mean specifically the meaning "There is a God", either as a statement of the kind "God exists", or as in "There is a God on the top of that mountain."Both instances are very common results on Google. However, I've been told by two Japanese that, in this case, "神様がいる" is the only correct form, since God is considered to be an animate entity. Also, one of them suggested that the structure "神様がある" could be used to mean "'to have' a God" (similar to "僕は姉がある"), though it might sound a bit unnatural. Additionally, some results are similar to "神様が、　ある日何々を言った…", but my guess is that they make up less than half of the total for ~がある.So, if only 神様がいる is correct, how can one account for the many examples employing ~がある
A few questions about these words. The words [蹴球]{しゅうきゅう}, [籠球]{ろうきゅう}, and [庭球]{ていきゅう} mean football, basketball, and tennis, respectively. But I have only seen them in a dictionary, and in practice I have only ever seen フットボール, バスケットボール, and テニス used. On the other hand, [野球]{やきゅう} is commonly used for "baseball", and does not usually use a loanword.How often are 蹴球, 籠球, and 庭球 used, and why is baseball the only one that doesn't　commonly use a loanword
面 by itself means "face", while 白 by itself means "white". How did these two words combine together to mean "interesting"
Consider the conjunction ども, e.g.:行けども言えどもFormation rule:Verb Hypothetical form (仮定形) + どもThis leads me to hypothesise that the conjunction けれども (meaning "but; however; although") is built from けれ + ども.I am unable to find a verb that is けれる. There is 蹴る though.What is the composition of けれども Or is it impossible to break it down further
Could someone explain the grammar/words behind this and similar phrases I did some research and probably found the explanation, but I am not sure if this is correct.The phrase may be found in a variety of places (e.g. here) where it is usually translated as "can't stop worrying" or just "so worried"心配 means "worry", this is clear.The meaning of たまらず is not this clear, though. My dictionary says that あず is the archaic negative form (same as in in the phrase "Vずに"). This means that the verb should be たまる. The closest verb I found is 堪る which means something like "to endure", "to bear", "to resist" (see goo jisho). So the phrase would literally mean "Cannot resist worrying". Does this explanation make any sense Is there some other, better, explanation
I'm asking how do you say something like "I don't want to fail" in Japanese. Yes, in anime they say something like "makenai". But I want to say or write it like an actual Japanese sentence in the polite form not the informal form so no slang please. I know -tai is I want to (verb). Any answer on how to say it formally will be very helpful.
In 謙譲語 the addition of honorific to a direct object depends on who owns it:（先生に）本をさしあげます。| I will give teacher my book（先生の）ご本をお借りします。| I shall borrow teacher's book（先生を）会場へご案内します。| I will show teacher to the meeting placeThere are some words that always take an honorific (examples discussed in other questions include お茶 and お手洗い）but 礼 is not one of them.  Why are "my" thanks honorific but not my book(I imagine that in Japanese they are not "my" thanks, or their is a difference between tangible/intangible objects/gestures, but these are guesses.)
I can't resist trying to find patterns in words.  These three words, for example, seem to fit a similar pattern:頷{うなづ}く　= [項]{うな} + 突{つ}く (source: community wiki)躓{つまづ}く　= [爪]{つま} + 突{つ}く (source: community wiki)額{ぬか}づく　= [額]{ぬか} + 突{つ}く (source: gogen-allguide)However, I can't seem to find the etymology of 跪{ひざまづ}く anywhere.  Since it appears to fit the pattern, I'd like to guess:跪{ひざまづ}く = [膝]{ひざ} + ま + 突{つ}くBut where does the ま come from  It doesn't seem to fit the pattern neatly like the others.
I have seen this expression a few times, and have never quite understood it. In particular, it seems to be equatable both to ですから and to んです, but I can't figure out where it would be used over either of those two expressions. Here is an example I found on Google:新聞{しんぶん}に目{め}を通{とお}していないと、仕事{しごと}が成立{せいりつ}しないからです。I believe this translates to "Since I haven't been skimming the newspaper,  I do not have a job." (but I am not sure, and please correct me if I'm wrong).What does the からです mean in this sentence And more importantly, when is it appropriate to use, and how does it differ from ですから and んです
I've got a copy of "オ・ヤサシ巨人BFG", Taeko Nakamura's translation of the famous children's book by Roald Dahl, The BFG. The story concerns a friendship between a little girl named Sophie and a friendly giant (the titular BFG). In one chapter, the BFG introduces Sophie to a delicious fizzy beverage, called "frobscottle". This drink has bubbles which flow down instead of up, and make the drinker fart in a way that propels them around the room (yep, it's a pretty silly story).In the original, this action is called a whizzpopper (a made-up word), and in Nakamura's translation, it is ゴナラ.My question: Where does this "ゴナラ" come from There are no results for it in http://jisho.org/, and various google search terms fail to turn up anything relevant for me.I would suspect that it is simply a made-up word, except that Nakamura's translations of Dahl's other made-up words all have some structure / come from existing words, e.g.:"Frobscottle" (the fizzy beverage) is 泡立ちエキス, "bubbles extract"."Snozzcumbers" (unpleasant tasting vegetables eaten by giants) are お化けキュウリ, "ghost cucumber".So, is ゴナラ pure onomatopoeia / a fabrication just for this story, or does it have some external meaning that I am missing

BackgroundWhile I'm not especially confident about the reliability of my sources (Wikipedia (0) (1) (2)  and some guys' personal websites), and it's possible that I transcribed some of these wrong, the sources agree on the following accent rules for -i verbs:The few bi-moraic ones are all unaccented with low initial tone (nà-i 'not', yò-i ~ èe 'good', kò-i 'dark, thick, strong', sù-i 'sour')All tri-moraic -i verbs I've seen specified give the accent on the 1st (penultimate) syllable; for exampleâtu-i [á.tsʉ̀.ì] 'hot, warm'îta-i [í.tà.ì] 'hurt'kûro-i [kú.ɽò.ì] 'black'kûsa-i [kú.sà.ì] 'smell like'sîro-i [ɕí.ɽò.ì] 'white'etc.For longer words, the accent seems to usually fall on the penultimate syllable. Initial pitch is usually high:tánôsi-i [tá.nó.ɕì.ì] 'fun'ómôro-i 'interesting, amusing'káwâi-i 'adorable'síkâku-i 'square-shaped'yáyakôsi-i 'complicated'and sometimes low:syòomôna-i [ɕò.ò.mó.nà.ì] 'boring'àhokûsa-i 'idiotic'But there seem to be a few exceptions:òisî-i [ò.ì.ɕí.ì] 'tasty'sìɴdô-i [ɕì.ɴ̀.dó.ì] 'tired'QuestionNow this looks like a straightforward rule: accent shifts to the right when it would otherwise fall on the second mora of a syllable. If valid, this rule entails that accent position is predictable for -i verbs. However, I'm suspicious of that because it has been emphasized (e.g. here) that unlike in Standard Japanese, the Kansai dialect's accent system is purely moraic and does not constrain accent to the first mora in a syllable.Also, there may be exceptions to the proposed rule, possibly mímiʔ̂ti-i 'stingy' or bábâʔti-i 'dirty, messy' or déʔ̂kai 'huge' or gôʔtu-i 'huge'. (But it's hard to tell the underlying accent pattern, since /ʔ̩/ is inherently voiceless, so these aren't clear exceptions.)So: is this rule valid Or are òisî-i / sìɴdô-i / bábâʔti-i / gôʔtu-i irregularly stressedNotation: Here I'm using the circumflex ⟨ ̂⟩ to mark accented syllable, and acute ⟨ ́⟩ and grave ⟨ ̀⟩ to indicate initial high and low pitch respectively (following the IPA).

This question is a follow up to この道をまっすぐ行ってください。Why “を” and not “で” posted earlier.If:道で転ぶ = fallover on the roadボールが道を転がる = a ball rolled along the street〜を転がす = roll something (他）How do we say:"I rolled a ball along the street from the police station to the second traffic lights"Is it:道沿い／道に沿って交番から二番目の信号までボールを転がした？[I want to capture the movement along the direction of the street and we can't have two をs. I have only just remembered the expression に沿う]
I'm writing a programming algorithm which converts code points of Kanji characters to their respective UTF-8 octets.My problem is, if I don't include 4-octet characters, and only deal with 3-octet ones, I will store each code point in 2 bytes for every character in the text. If I also include 4-octet Kanji, I need to store each code point in 4 bytes (actually they theoretically consume 3 bytes, but it is not practical to store 3 byte variables for optimization concerns); that makes two times more memory consumption.Normal Kanji ==&gt; UTF-8 octets: 3 bytes ==&gt; UTF-8 code point: up to 0xFFFF (2 bytes)Rare Kanji   ==&gt; UTF-8 octets: 4 bytes ==&gt; UTF-8 code point: above 0xFFFF (4 bytes)I read another question about this. It is said that only some very rarely-used characters in the "CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B" and "CJK Compatibility Ideographs Supplement" blocks are encoded with 3 octets.What does rarely used mean in this case How often are they used Can I completely ignore them What happens if my algorithm converts these rarely used characters into some kind of "unidentified character" code(Please don't move this question to Stack Overflow. I'm more concerned with linguistic usage of these characters. My question is not related to programming.)
In a quiz, I got a question where one had to complete with に、を、で or が the following sentence:この道（？）まっすぐ行ってください。The correct answer being:この道をまっすぐ行ってください。It always seems more natural to me to put で here instead of を as 道 describes where the action will take place.Could anyone please give me the reason behind this choice in Japanese
I've always had a hard time immediately understanding the differences between passive, causative, and causative-passive. If I really sit down and try to work out the meaning I can generally get it, but I have a bad habit of just skimming over it. One verb that is giving me trouble is 笑う:The passive is 笑われる, or "to be laughed at". This seems pretty straight-forward.たけしさんはメアリーさんによく笑われます。　Takeshi is often laughed at by Mary.The causative is 笑わせる, or "to make laugh, to let laugh". Again, this makes sense to me.彼は子供達を笑わせた。 He made the children laugh.What I don't understand is the the causative-passive, 笑わせられる. My understanding of it is that it follows the pattern of "is made to do", that someone is made to do something that they don't want to do. But how does this work with laughter It seems to me that this is the same meaning as "being made to laugh". The only other thing I can think of is "was made to laugh at someone", like in a peer-pressure sort of situation. Take this JLPT practice question:△△さんの冗談には、いつも思わず 笑わせられた 。The wrong answers include 笑われた, and 笑わせた. Why is the answer the causative-passive (せられた), and not the causative (せた) What is the difference in meaning Is the causative out-right wrong here, or is it just less-right or natural then the causative-passive Is there a clue in the sentence structure that I'm missing
Here is the sentence: それは改良を必要としますが、すぐにということではありません。I can't understand this part: すぐに_Adverb + という_Particle + こと_Noun + では_DEWA + ありません_Verb. I know that という is an expression "said; called thus", but what is it doing here and what connection does it have to the preceding adverb and other sentence partsIs it just "すぐに_quickly という_said"
Here is the sentence: それなのにの言い換えや別の言い方。Taking it apart: それなのに_Conjunction + の_Particle + 言い換え_Noun + や_Particle + 別_Noun + の_Particle + 言い方_Noun。This construction puzzles me. What is の doing right after "Yet" conjunction Please correct me if I made a mistake.
I see the character 叉 in a lot of words that do not seem to have anything in common:[夜叉]{やしゃ}[三叉路]{さんさろ}[叉焼]{チャーシュー}[音叉]{おんさ}Is there any commonality here What does 叉 represent (Is the Chinese meaning different than the Japanese meaning)
I have a sentence:来年にはテレフォニカが製品投入へ。This is translated by Google:Telefonica is to rollout next year.Where is the verb in this sentence as 製品投入 looks like "noun" + "noun" And what is へ doing after the 投入.I know that in Chinese 投入 can be both verb and noun, but japanese dictionary says it's a noun only.
Consider:XにYで行く学校に自転車で行く "Go to school by bicycle" ("means/instrumentality" interpretation)"Is* bicycle and go to school" (Questionable) (Verb conjunctive interpretation)XにTraversal Verb-て行く 学校に歩いて行く "Go to school by walking" ("means/instrumentality" interpretation)"Walk and go to school" (Verb conjunctive interpretation)The leads me to ask:Does て-form implicitly contain the で of meansOr is the で of means a て-form of something *(the copula だ perhaps) There seems to be something common between て-form and で of means.
What do I say in Japanese when I'm trying to imply, "This is my dad", "These are my parents", "This is my friend(female)" or "This is my manager"I don't think using これ is polite, nor will 彼 be appropriate.
What are the nuances between these three verbs when paired with 責任 I understand they all mean "to take responsibility", but are they interchangeable, etc責任を取る責任を負う責任を持つ負う's definition says (among other things) "to take responsibility for". Does this mean it can be used by itself (i.e. without "責任を")Also, when would 責任がある be appropriate to say that you take the responsibility (It seems to me that that implies where the responsibility is, regardless of if it's recognized by the person/party who has it.)Bonus Question: Are there other common ways of conveying taking responsibility
If ばけもの / ばけもん / お化け can, in general, be understood to mean ghost/apparition/monster, what is the connection to the meaning of 化け, meaning "transform" (or "transforming one's appearance") Is it implying a creature transforming its appearance, or the appearance of person transforming from corporal body to ghost, or a combination thereof (or perhaps it refers to the state of flux that a ghost exists in, or even something theater-related)I am interested if anyone has any insight as to the etymology of the term and how it came to mean "ghost/monster". Furthermore, does anyone have an idea if the け of 化け derives from the verb 化ける, or did the noun predate the verb

So, I was reading a children's story and came across this sentence:「いいか、この最後{さいご}のローソクが消{き}えたら、本当{ほんとう}のお化{ば}けが出{で}るかもしれん。だが、どんなお化けが出ようと、お互{たが}いに逃{に}げっこなしにしよう」What I'm having trouble understanding and dictionaries haven't been able to help is decoding the 逃げっこなしにしよう part.

In the Kanzen Master N2 listening textbook, there's a table of phrases to be aware of, and it includes both 申{もう}し出{で} and 提案{ていあん} in the "function" part of the table:提案:〜たらどう？こっちの色にしたらどう？  ("How about going with this colour")〜たほうがいいもっと大きくしたほうがいいよ。  ("It'd be best to go with a larger (sized one).")申し出:〜ましょう（か）荷物、持ちましょうか？  ("Shall I/we take your luggage")But what is the difference between 提案 and 申し出 Both seem to me to mean "proposal", and the Genius J-E dictionary definition for 申し出 includes 提案 in it:もうしで【申し出】 proposal: …【…する／…という】提案【to do／that節】…offer: …【…しようという】提案【to do】…

I came across the following dialogue, which occurs right as the hero arrives:「やっと来おったか。」I'm not sure how to parse 来おった.  Is it 来{き} + 居{お}る  If so, what exactly does this form mean  Do other verbs have a similar formSearching online, I see examples like とうとう来おった and ついに来おった, so my best guess right now is that the nuance is related to とうとう・ついに・やっと.I've tried looking this up in paper dictionaries and online, but I'm having trouble finding it anywhere, so I thought I'd ask here!
I'm struggling to understand the difference between the verb suffix ～方【かた】 and the noun 方法【ほうほう】. As an example, the difference between 遊び方 (which seems to mean something like "manner in which someone is playing") and 遊ぶ方法 (which seems to mean something like "means by which someone is playing"). I'm also not sure whether the former is the same as 遊びの仕方 (and if so, this page answers my question). Can anyone help me to clear these up Thanks!
This question is prompted by the earlier question on the use of 書ける. Initially I thought the answer might explain the difference between these two (eg 彼は頭がよく切れる|he is (very) sharp) but in most cases, including this one the adjective seems unnecessary. (For reference, I have made a list of common examples below.)(Also, as an observation, because I don't want to over-extend the scope of the question  切れる also seems to be used in compound verbs while 切り is used in compound "masu-形 nouns" such as 締め切り/deadline or　思い切り/to one's content.)Examples of 切れる：ひもが切れる|  the string breaks電池が切れる|  the battery diesたばこが切れる|  be out of cigarettes賞味期限が切れる|  past best before dateしびれが切れる （＝足がしびれる）|  legs have gone to sleep彼は頭が（よく）切れる|  he is (very) sharpExamples of 切る：電源を切る|  switch off野菜の水気を切る  drain water from vegetablesスタートを切る|  start off１００メートル競走で１０秒を切る|  run 100m in less than 10 secsハンドルを右に切る|  turn the wheel to the rightカードをよく切る|  Please shuffle the cards well. ｜キレて、犯罪を犯す若者が増加している|　The number of young people committing crimes as a result of rage is increasing.Examples of compund verbs with 切れる：チケットが売り切れる|  tickets are sold out 　だれがそれを言い切れるだろうか｜  who would dare to say that with (any) certainty　会話が  途切れる （とぎれる）｜  the conversation comes to a halt
I've seen the kanji 風 appear in several different illnesses:  [風邪]{«かぜ»} (a cold), [中風]{ちゅう・ふう} (paralysis), and [痛風]{つう・ふう} (gout).  Conceivably there may be others, but I haven't seen them.What does the wind have to do with any of these (aside from possibly catching a cold by going out into the cold wind—which I believe is a fallacy anyway)
This is an issue that came up with my host family quite often. I have never been quite clear on which to use. In particular, 子 seems somewhat rude (much to the same effect as 男 or 女). On the other hand, 子供 "seems" less rude, but I'm not entirely sure if that's the case. Finally, お子さん seems very polite (for obvious reasons), but it seems almost too polite--especially to refer to kids, with whom you would most likely use casual language.What is the difference between 子, 子供, and お子さん
I'm having difficulty in understanding 書けている (initially observed from an answer to "パソコンが　得意だ/わかる/上手だ"). Also observed from SPACEALC:この小説は上手に書けている。最もよく書けている記事。いくつかのスペルミスを除けば、その小論文はよく書けている。I thought that the sentence would have been  この小説は上手に{書いている・書いてある}。instead.(Q1) What is the difference between 書いている and 書けている And what does 書けている mean(Q2) What is the grammatical composition of 書けている Is it potential form+ている(Q3) Is this pattern of potential form+ている productive I.e. can it be arbitrarily extended to other verbs with a similar result
The following sentence and translation appear in my textbook (総まとめ　読解　N１, p114):視聴率さえとっておれば、どんな"やらせ" をやろうとも、メディアの責任を考えればモラルに反すると思うことをやっても、大手を振ることが出来る世界A world (media industry) where they irresponsibly manipulate the content and do things contrary to social mores, as long as a high rating can be obtained. I wonder if someone could explain:1) what/why is おれば　used (I think it is いる　but why おる？）2) what is the meaning of 大手を振る, literally and how does it work in this context
I often see ですな used in social text posts.Examples:こんにちわ、あついし、ひまですな。いいてんきですなｗA Google search for "ですな" does not show me any explanation.Here is how I understand ですな in such context:Humourously "aristocrat"-sounding.Auto-derision of fake deepness.Am I getting it rightWhy would someone use "ですな" rather than not use itWhat nuance does it give to the sentence
On one page in my book, I came across 3 different phrases for, what seems to me, subtly different ways of saying the same thing. The first was: 頭の隅にThen: 脳裏にThe information I was able to find was vague at best. Judging from the sort of "hidden" quality I attach to both 隅 and 裏, I take to mean roughly "the back of one's mind". The third phrase was: 目の奥にI think this should be taken rather figuratively, meaning something like "the mind's eye" (judging from the context in the book), but again the definitions I could find for this were not helpful. Are these phrases related Are my guesses off the mark
When I was first learning Japanese, I learned that the explanatory form, -んです is always constructed by conjugating the verb in short form and adding -んです, and that the です part is never conjugated. But in more than one instance, I have seen -んじゃない used for the explanatory form. For example:おはしの使い方を知らないんです。as opposed to:おはしの使い方を知るんじゃないです。What does it mean when the -です is conjugated rather than the main verb
きのうは　きょうより　ひとが　すくないです。Is it saying: X number of people yesterday &lt; Y number of people todayor X number of people yesterday &gt; Y number of people todayI'm getting the translation of より confused and can't make heads or tails of it.
So I was studying this book called 日本語生中継, and there was this question where you're supposed to choose the inappropriate word among others. And I got stuck at this sentence:私は、パソコンが(得意だ.わかる.上手だ.)The book says the correct, or rather, incorrect answer, was 上手だ. But I don't seem to understand why, as all three seem correct to me.

Can anyone give a few more common examples (or even more insight) of when we should be "switching" from English passive into Japanese active/non-passive(A joint effort might help a lot of us to make our Japanese more natural I am happy to compile into one answer...)BACKGROUND/EXAMPLES_________________________________________________________________________We have a number of very good questions on the use of passive verbs including: 1 Passive vs. active form of verb (past) What is the difference2 Passive verb forms for intransitive verbs3 What forms of verbs (potential or passive) are more frequent in JapaneseDuring the most recent it was pointed out that often when the passive is used in English the  active/non-passive is preferred in Japanese, and over-use of the passive is a common problem among Japanese learners. I know an additional reference on how the passive is used in Japanese (Dict of Basic Jpse Grammar p33) but  can anyone give a few more common examples (or even more insight) of when we should be "switching" from English passive into Japanese active(A joint effort might help a lot of us to make our Japanese more natural)I have added my own (possibly less common) example that recently confused me to the two recently given below.Example 1:ニュースに驚いた &lt;-- Not passiveI was surprised at the news. &lt;-- Passive Example 2:These cookies were made by her yesterday.これらのクッキーは昨日、彼女によって作られました。　#1 &lt;-- Passive彼女が昨日これらのクッキーを作りました。#2 &lt;-- Not passive: possibly more likely to be usedExample 3:The armed forces were dispatched &lt;-- passive軍隊が出動する &lt;-- Not passive
(Note: I'm part of the "I know bits and pieces of Japanese from watching anime" group, so I lack an in-depth knowledge of Japanese)As I'm hearing Japanese occasionally there will be an English word said. Lots of the time there seems to be a suffix on it. Here's a random sampling of words and what the suffixes sound like:print-ofight-odeep-ehspeed-orock-uhtype-ehprint-ehrope-ehboss-ehAs you can see there seem to be 2 major suffixes: -eh (or -euh, depending on the person saying it) and -o. Are there any rules on which to use Does it even depend on the person or area the person is from
"It seems there is none" is なさそう, which escapes the usual rule for 形容詞 (イ-adjectives), which says "drop the い and add そう".Is there a historical explanation for this exception And does it have anything to do with なさいません

What is a correct translation for 「そんなことない」 and when can it be usedI understand the "this is wrong"/"this is not correct" general sense but is this considered either as harsh or a gentle way of showing disagreementAlso a direct translation would be "there is no such thing". Can this expression be applied to a person
Could someone explain the difference between the following two expressions:恐ろしさといったらなかった恐ろしいといったらなかったI am struggling with the first which my text book tells me means とても恐ろしかった. Why is the さーform of the adjective used in favour of the normal 恐ろしい？Another sentence that gave me a problem, together with my best guess of the meaning is the following:飛行機の窓から見えたオーロラの美しさといったらなかったThe aurora I saw from the plane's window was too beatiful for wordsWould the following sentence mean the same飛行機の窓から見えたオーロラが美しいといったらなかった  [~美しかったといったらない？]
How much is changed or lost in translating (say) an old Japanese text that's mainly written in kanji into hanzi How does it compare to translating into a completely foreign language like English I'm curious if I should pick up a Chinese translation instead of an English translation of an old work because it would be more faithful to the original, and I'd like to practice my Chinese. But really I'm just plain curious; I'm not even sure if I will find a complete translation, so it's just theoretical for now.(I know close to nothing about Japanese, and the Dunning-Kruger effect is keeping me from knowing how ignorant this question is.)
I am having trouble with the bold part of this sentence from wikipedia:バブル経済（バブルけいざい、economic  bubble）とは、概ね不動産や株式をはじめとした時価資産の資産価格が投機によって実体経済の経済成長以上のペースで高騰し続け、投機によって支えなければならない市場が、投機によって支えきれなくなるまでの経済状態を指す。The best I can get for the bolded text is:The state of the market that needs to be propped up by speculation until  it can no longer be supported by speculation.This use of ～なければならない　combined with ～によって is hard for me to translate.  Since によって is repeated twice, I am curious if this is some special grammatical construct.In particular it seems that ～なければならない here might mean not 'needs to be propped up', but something else, since logically the markets do not require themselves to be propped up.I'm probably just missing something basic.  Please give me a translation and explanation.
The sentence that that I heard was 頼りにしている。 Google Translate tells me that means "I'm counting on you". My understanding of Japanese tells me "this doesn't compute". Is there a general rule for translating にしている or している in sentences like this What's the general meaning of that phrase
I'm a super beginner in Japanese, so excuse me if this question is really simple. Or stupid.As an exercise, sometimes I count up the things on nearby desks or tables and try to list them in Japanese, just to get used to the counters. Today, I was waiting to get lunch and I saw a table with three sandwiches (amongst other things) on it, but I don't know what the counter for the sandwiches would be. I know if I was to count the slices of ham within one of the sandwiches, I could use -[切れ]{きれ}. Otherwise, I don't know. Is there a counter for something made up of smaller pieces of something elseI suppose I could use a general counter, but I was wondering if there was a counter for things like loaves of bread or blocks of cheese that could also apply to things like sandwiches
A simple question to those speaking and the native ones. What of the two forms (potential verbs or passive voice verbs) in Japanese verbs is more frequentThis question may seem strange, but I need to know, as there is an ichidan ambiguity between potential and passive forms, so to make a more or less proper decision which one form is which. I can, of course, rely on the particles, such as Ni and Wo. But in general, which form is less frequent Which form do Japanese people use more often
In this sentence I've a some doubts"自分　の　事し　考えぬ　には、この　氷　は　溶かせない" I think a translation would be" Think to yourself of this matter of you, this ice never will melt" But it's just a guess. I can decipher correctly this sentence. kかんがえぬ　is negative How translate 自分のことし？
I have seen 創始者 been used in the following contexts:仏教の創始者、プログラムの創始者、儒教の創始者創業者 probably refers to founders of businesses:店の創業者、紀伊国屋の創業者However, I only have a vague idea about how these are used.Could anybody care to explain :(
I've seen the internet slang 凸{とつ}待{ま}ち used for "waiting for incoming (Skype etc) calls" pretty frequently, but what is the etymology and usage of the wordI've read on other sites that it came from the following:突撃{とつげき}待{ま}ち → とつげき待{ま}ち → 凸{とつ}げき待{ま}ち → 凸{とつ}待{ま}ちBut why did "attack" come to mean "incoming calls" And why did 凸{とつ} ("convex") come to be used instead of 突{とつ}Also, can it be used in a more generic sense, i.e. "waiting for an [assault/attack]"
I just found this phrase in my book (I don't know how much context is relevant, this is the entire sentence):それにな、わたしが商人の線がうすい、といった理由はもうひとつある。I looked up the phrase and found this 線が細い. It means "feeble, sensitive, fragile", and I assume that using うすい changes little in the meaning. What I gather is that the わたし is talking about the 商人's fragility. Question 1: Are these two things about rightQuestion 2: Is there a clear etymology here What exactly is someone's 線 It doesn't seem to be possible to say 線が厚い and have it mean "robust"...
They both mean country don't they I saw this phrase: 国家公安局部長。 When I looked it up 国家, the definition was just "country". So I'm not understanding the nuance between the two words.
I know how to read hiragana and katakana, but know nothing else. A lot of people I know want me to write their names in Japanese. Is it right to write them in any system, or are there specific rules
In a comment to this answer it was mentioned that おはようございます can be used in a variety of situations other than in the morning.To me it only makes sense to say "good morning" when it is actually morning in some sense.

I'm translating a manga in which one character use a very slangy or contracted way of speaking while the others talk more standard-like.I've already encountered the stem+ん as a short form the negative stem+ない.

I've found this kanji during Shodo practice. My teacher (Japanese) didn't know the meaning (she recognized the Tooth bushu/radical but not the "word").I tried to look it up on the electronic dictionaries I own, both Japanese and Chinese, but while the kanji exists and even has a phonetic associated to it:there is no actual meaning.Finally I got something from a Chinese online dictionary.Allegedly (I used Google translate on the whole page) it is an old ideogram for "Milk Teeth".Now the question(s): Does this mean anything in Japanese What would be the current Japanese way to indicate "Milk teeth"
Do native speakers of Japanese use phonetic elements when reading less common kanji  For example, does the compound 咆哮 look like ほうこう because of the elements 包 and 孝, even if you haven't learned to read 咆哮 yet  Does seeing 癇癪 remind you of the reading かんしゃく because of 間（閒） and 積, even though the sound appears to have changed between 積 and 癪Do students in Japan use phonetic elements while learning kanji  For example, I came across はず written as 筈, so I looked it up and saw the reading カツ.  Thinking of 筈 as たけかんむり and カツ helped me remember it, because I know the phonetic element 舌（カツ） from 活 and 括, so I ended up learning the 音読み even though I couldn't find any vocabulary using that reading.  Would this be normal or strange in JapanAre phonetic relationships obvious to native speakers without being studied explicitlyWhat references would students in Japan use to look up the phonetic derivations of 形声文字  All I have is Henshall's book (written in English), but that only covers the old set of 常用漢字.  I know if I'm forced to guess based on 音読み or visual similarity, some of my guesses will be wrong.  My 漢和辞典 doesn't cover character etymology at all, and googling for 字源 only seems to be helpful some of the time.This is my first question on StackExchange, so please let me know if I've done it wrong.  Thank you!
Going hiking here in Japan, you can hardly pass anyone without either saying お疲れさまです, おはようございます (I go hiking in the morning) or こんにちは.Some people (young males in particular) greet you with either チュワッ or オッス. A great idea, since everybody's out of breath. I gather that チュワッ is a contraction of こんにちは, but オッス could be either お疲れさまです or おはようございます. Does the person greeting you with オッス actually have one of the two possible greetings in mind, or is it just used more like a universal sound, which can be used in any situation
In Japan for three years, and I've noticed that the locals often sound like they're combining the two words "arigatō" and "gozaimasu" into a single word, "arigatōzaimasu".Am I hearing things (possible, as they speak very quickly), or is this a common practice
I've noticed that sometimes loan words (usually pairs) are truncated to just the first two morae from each word:Smash Brothers　➤　スマッシュブラザーズ　➤　スマブラ"Don't mind."　➤　ドンマイI assume this is done to shorten the writing and pronunciation. Is the accepted practice to just grab the first two morae from each word and shove them all together
Is there an "opposite" of 和製英語 (meaning Japanese words/phrases invented by English speakers)  Maybe like {英・米・欧}製日本語  Because I always see/hear Japanese words in English and they drive me nuts!The biggest one is when people pronounce 酒 as サキ.  Another one I saw on a local Japanese restaurant.  They have Monday night "Izakai" (イザカイ) nights (I don't know what this means -- maybe cheap drinks and appetizers).  Apparently, some English speaker heard 居【い】酒【ざか】屋【や】 and just decided to make a cool-sounding English abbreviation of it (which is really weird considering the owner is Japanese).So is there some set word to describe this
I've come across this form many times in my Japanese Bible.  The meaning is quite obvious based on context, and seems to be one of the following: ～べきです, ～ほうがいい, ～なさい, or ～ように (let it be ～).Here are a few verses with this form:神を[畏]{おそ}れる人は皆、聞くがよい...　―　詩編　６６編１６節　／　Come and hear, all who fear God... - Psalm 66:16イエスは、「友よ、しようとしていることをするがよい」と言われた。すると人々は進み寄り、イエスに手をかけて捕らえた。　―　マタイによる福音書　２６章５０節　／　And Jesus said to him, “Friend, do what you have come for.” Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and seized Him. - Matthew 26:50イエスは、「さあ、あなたがただけで人里離れた所へ行って、しばらく休むがよい」と言われた... －　マルコによる福音書　６章３１節　／　And He said to them, “Come away by yourselves to a secluded place and rest a while.” - Mark 6:31しかし、たとえわたしたち自身であれ、天使であれ、わたしたちがあなたがたに告げ知らせたものに反する福音を告げ知らせようとするならば、呪われるがよい。　－　ガラテヤの信徒への手紙１章８節　／　But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we have preached to you, he is to be cursed! - Galatians 1:8How is this form "allowed" to exist without a こと／の following the verb  Is this only a literary written form or something  Because I've never seen this form anywhere except my Bible.

I've always thought of 姿 as a physical form or shape, but I came across this passage from my book:彼らの話から浮かびあがってきたのは、・・・・・{この人}の姿だった。(I took just took out some descriptions of the woman they're talking about that aren't really relevant [that I can tell, anyway].)I imagine that I've got the meaning of the sentence--that these guys are talking about this person--but what exactly does 姿 here represent In the story, these guys are trying to track down a woman, but at this point they haven't seen actually seen her, only heard about her from rumors, etc.. Is 姿　this sort of image they have of her Is it sort of a representation of who she is, and not her physical personMore importantly, is this a common usage of 姿　or more literary
Why are wisdom teeth called 親知{おやし}らず in JapaneseThe literal meaning seems to be something like "unknown to the parents".
I've heard this word used quite a few times now, and I'm tired of pretending to understand it. Why does 「やきもち」 refer to being jealous Is this a slang word How do people use this word
I'd like to use ikigai ("something one lives for; purpose in life; raison d'être") for a calligraphy (shodō) work. According to Tangorin there are three possible ways to write this:生き甲斐生きがい 生甲斐It's shodō, so I'd prefer to use a purely kanji version (i.e. #3) but I wonder if these are absolutely interchangeable or if there is a "preferred version" (and in that case, which one and why).
I recently read that:着る（きる）is used for the wearing clothes for either the upper half of the body (eg 上着）or the whole body in general.履く（はく）is used for bottom half (eg shoes, socks, trousers). する　is used for accessories (watch, scarf etc)Is there are a specific/common use for 着ける (つける） or the type of clothes/accessories that take this verb
Is the "wa-particle" in katakana ワ or ハ？(Just a quick question - I think I have seen both used, but if ワ is correct then I have just seen the results of a computer o/p automatically using ハ)

I've recently been seeing あと as well as ご as Furigana on top of 後 in その後, but is there a difference in usage or meaning between the different readingsLooking at the Yahoo thesaurus, it seems it can also be read as のち. When would this reading be used over the others
In the Kanzen Master N2 listening textbook, there's the following sentence:女：　昨日、はっといたんだけど。Of which in the answers the correct reply was specified as:男：　その壁に？  Man: On that wall ()But I'm not sure what the first sentence means or how to break it up, let alone why that's the answer. What exactly does the first sentence mean Is it はっと + いた to mean "I was taken aback" If so, why would it be done on a wall or is that some kind of an expression, e.g. "Because of that obstacle/barrier"
How I understand it, ～べく, meaning "for the purpose of..." / "In order to....", is the conjunctive form of ～べき, which indicates something that should be done.たくさん本を読む べき   (you should read many books)エンジニアになる べく 一生懸命勉強した (I studied hard in order to become an engineer)In the following example sentence, is the べくして related grammatically or semantically to ～べき or ～べく起こる べくして 起こった事故だった。  It was an accident waiting to happen.
The whole sentence readsこれ以上　シャレてる時間はないwhich is from the lyrics of this anime song and, according to this website, meansThere's no more time to be fooling aroundI understand the first three lines, and the English translation seems to be literal.I know that これ means "this". According to JGram, 以上 means "as long as", i.e., as long as you are a student 学生である以上は, etc. However, I'm not sure what これ以上 means and whether the これ is the same one that means "this". I think シャレてる時間はない already means "there's no more time to be fooling around".
I found a few examples at ALC, but still not sure about the best way to say it.
This question has made me think about the class of adjectives, which can function both as イ- and as ナ-adjective, e.g.大きい   大きな小さい   小さな真っ白い 真っ白な (etc.)細かい   細かな暖かい   暖かな四角い   四角な (etc.)柔らかい 柔らかなIn my (non-)answer to the question, I mentioned that the difference of やわらかい and やわらかな is very subtle at best.I am wondering, can this maybe explained in more generality What are the differences in the word pairs above
I was trying to translate this sentence:僕はアルバイトしてはレコードばかり買っていたから、一日半働けばLP一枚買えるな、と思って働いていた。I think I get the overall meaning as: Because I spent all my wages on records I went to work thinking "If I work a day and a half I can buy an LP."But I'm confused by the アルバイトしてはWhat's going on with the grammar here
What is the purpose of the suffix "さ" on adjectives like 美しさ and 多さThe former is the title of an essay by Banana Yoshimoto, so I don't have much context for it.  The book editors translated it as "On beauty" which didn't help me understand what this さ business was all about.In the case of the latter, she writes: "品揃えの多さについつい買い込んでしまい、大荷物を抱えて併設の花屋に行った。" Which I understand as:"There were many goods there that, against my better judgement, I had purchased. Carrying the bags I went to the attached flower shop."
Romaji is when you use the Roman alphabet to write out Japanese. I.e. you use "abc" instead of "あいうえお". Taking that one step further, what do you call it when you use "123" instead of "一二三" My first thought was to call it "Roman numerals", but those are "I, II, III"...so would they be "Romaji numbers" I realize usually we would just call them "numbers" in English (and in Japanese "数字"), but there is there a way to call them when there is a need to differentiate themThe reason why I'm asking is because I was reading a book, and someone's age was written out in kanji numbers, and it got me thinking.
When referring to a time where one was a certain age, are there any differences in meaning, nuance or usage between saying, for example, 18の時 and 18歳の時.I always thought you needed to have the 歳, but I ran into an example of it without it, so now I'm wondering. Bonus question: Is this different for はたち I.e. can you say 20の時
So I'm watching this anime a couple of days ago and one of the characters were describing a group of people. He ended his description with "GIGN to iu na no inu". The subtitle says that meant: "Those dogs of the GIGN". So I'm wondering is "GIGN no inu" or "GIGN de inu" wrong I would think they all mean the same thing.*GIGN = military police unit
Can one differentiate by pronunciation between [父]{ちち} and [乳]{ちち} (as for 雨 and 飴)If not, does anyone have a reasonable explanation for why 父 and 乳 have the same pronunciation It seems unlikely that they stem from the same word, which was assigned two different characters, when 漢字 were imported from China...
I am wondering about the history about the beginning of the week. Although some recent calendars start their week on Monday, "traditionally", the Japanese start their week on Sunday (so that 今週の日曜日 will always be in the past). But this is a fairly new tradition.Why was Sunday made the beginning of the week when Japan adopted the Gregorian calendarThere is a lunar calendar (睦月, 如月, 弥生, etc.) and a solar calendar (七十二候). Furthermore, there is the concept of auspicious days, in which a week has 6 days and a bunch more of calendar-type conventions.Do any of these contain a "Sunday" as beginning of their respective concepts of a week
Could somebody provide a bit more explanation, possibly giving correct and incorrect examples on how to use に with "masu-stem (連用形 stem) + に + Verb" as illustrated in the following examplesBoth feel intuitively sound but I cannot find an explanation that allows me to compose my own sentences. なお、本状と行き違いにお支払い済みの場合はお許しくださいPlease forgive us in the case that payment has been completed "in crossing" with this letter(ie while the letter was still on its way)(note1)そして通りすがりに鐘をならしつつ、かれは隣室へと一同を先導した。And ringing the bell in passing, he led the way into the adjoining roomWhat are my thoughtsに indicates that (と)行き違い describes the manner in which お支払い(済み) was done and seems to be the same as the に below (despite お支払い済み appearing not to be a verb)It looks similar to Nにして／連用形 stemながらにして which "indicates a time[/point] when a surprising [event] takes place"(note2) but does not fit the pattern.It seems to be different from the familiar 「を買いにいく」which has a clear purpose and direction ("to go to buy something") or the other use of this pattern covered in another question "How does one use the “[V ます stem] に [Vタ]” pattern (as in 待ちに待った)".Its not an "N1にN2 pair"(because I asked in a previous question)*Note1: This often appears in payment reminders. The English equivalent is more likely to be "Please ignore this notice if you have already paid (this card and your payment have crossed)" but I think this literal translation is more helpful to solve the question.Note2: From Dictionary of Advanced Japanese Grammar*

After reading this awesome question, I got to thinking about different animal meat.  Upon researching a little, there seems to be different conventions in referring to different meats.Using 訓読み（鳥・鶏）肉　→　とりにく  豚肉　→　ぶたにくUsing 音読み牛肉　→　ぎゅうにく  羊肉　→　ようにく  豚肉　→　とんにく  鶏肉　→　けいにく[Animal] + の + 肉子牛の肉　→　こうしのにく　(veal)  かにの肉　→　crab meatWhy is there not one consistent way of doing this
In English, when we say someone is "talking shop", we mean that they are having a conversation about a particular trade or skill that they're familiar with (usually because it's their profession), with someone else who is equally familiar with it. In this kind of conversation people use the language they normally would while working (i.e. they wouldn't use layman's terms or dumb-down their word choice like they would when talking to someone outside the profession). When people are talking shop, it is (by definition) rather hard to understand by someone who doesn't know about said profession.Is there anything similar to "talking shop" in Japanese, while keeping the slangy tone
I was reading this two articles:Onigiri wikipedia's articleNigiri explanation inside wikipedia's sushi articleI first thought that onigiri was a type of sushi but it's not.It calls my attention how something with similar names mean something so different. So my question is:What does nigiri meanDoes the o in the beginning of a word mean something special
What words are used for dolphin meatSearching jisho.org using "dolphin" in the English field listed several different words for dolphin, but no compounds involving meat. Neither the English nor the Japanese editions of Wikipedia have an entry about dolphin meat. However, the Japanese article on dolphin drive fishing mentions イルカ肉 , which'd be イルカ "dolphin (or other small toothed whales, such as porpoises, belugas, etc.)" according to jisho.org, plus the kanji for meat. Is イルカ肉 the only word, or are there other words as wellBackground: In case I get accused of trolling. Someone asked a question about dolphin meat on another Stack Exchange site yesterday, and I was wanting to look up how many cookpad recipes mention dolphin meat as an ingredient. This question could also be useful for someone wanting to know the Japanese for dolphin meat in order to avoid eating it - I know of one person asking the name of a certain meat (not dolphin) to ensure that they didn't ever eat it.
The sentence "I also ate in Tokyo" can mean three different things:(Aside from my friends who ate there), I also ate in Tokyo.(Aside from the other places where I tried local cuisines), I also ate in Tokyo.(Aside from shopping and other activities), I also ate in Tokyo.How do you distinguish these sentences in Japanese, without, of course, literally translating the phase inside the parentheses If my rusty Japanese is correct, the first two sentences may be expressed as私も東京に食べた。  私は東京も食べた。I have no idea how to express the third. If a direct object is specified, I suppose mo may also be used, e.g,私は中華料理も東京に食べた。In general, what are the ways to express "also" in Japanese when "also" pertains to a noun (which can be the object, direct object, etc), verb, adjective and other parts of a sentence
What is the etymology of がらんと, an adverb meaning empty or deserted
I generally know ～まま as used in the sense that something is left in a certain state, for example: 窓を開けたまま寝る.Does this have a different meaning or connotation when used following the passive voice For example, in this sentence:わたしは言 われるままに 、彼に従ってきたつもりだ。This is what I've puzzled out myself, but it doesn't seem to make much sense to me. "わたし" is marked with は making that person the recipient of the action (and "彼" the one doing the action). "彼" intends to follow...something, perhaps "わたし", while "わたし" is in the sate of having been told something (or spoken to, etc).
姉は学校を卒業後は海外留学したいそうです。ane ha gakkou wo sotsugyougo ha kaigairyuugaku shitai sou desu.My sister says that she wants to study abroad after graduating from school.I found this sentence on http://www.mahou.orgIf it is correct, would I also be able to write the same sentence (expressing the same meaning) in the following manner I am specifically wondering about expressing desire of a third party subject using したい as opposed to したがっています. (also, is the translation's use of "says" problematic)姉は学校を卒業後は海外留学したがっているそうです。
I've read that potential form of the ru-verb is formed by replacing る with られる, which is exactly the same for the passive form of ru-verbs. How can we tell the passive form and potential apart in this case
Why is "Xy" pronounced as "[Ki Shi]{キ シ}" in [Xylitol]{キシリトール}I believe "Xy" can pronounced as "Zai", which is probably a valid sound in Japanese.I would like to know its etymology too, if there is any.
I am struggling to grasp the meaning of this expression 「そればかりか、〜Vるというようなことさえ、始めはしない」It comes up in the following sentence. The English translation is my best effort but I am guessing from the context.障子では、一箇所破れたと言っても全部取り替えるようなことはしない。そればかりか、破れた枡の１５センチ角ぐらいの紙全体を切り取ってそこに新しい紙をはるというようなことさえ、始めはしない。まずは破れた所を元に戻し.....Even if you tear part of a Shoji (sliding door) this never means that you have to replace the entire sheet of paper on one side. On the contrary cutting out the torn piece as a 15 cm square and pasting over a new piece is just the beginning of the story. First restore the torn  area to its original state [ready for repair]....[The piece then goes on to explain how after  covering the hole with a new patterned piece of paper the Shoji is not just repaired it is improved.]I think そればかりか is equivalent to だけではなく but my problem is  〜ことさえ、始めはしない：My guess is ballpark but at best clumsy.
When I look at the words for professions, there are usually kanji such as 員、者、長、師、屋 and such, that end the name. These appear to make sense to me; however, what about ones such as 家、手、and 士 For example, why does 歌手 mean "singer" Does this have anything to do with 手 or "hands" The same could be said for 作家 similarly. How did these kanji as suffixes come about to represent any given profession Why not any others

I understand from my previous question on the N1 に N2 construction that it is usually a phrase with omission of a verb (eg パンにバターをぬる makes パンにバター, which comes from パンにぬる and バターをぬる). If this is the case then how can we apply this logic to the following sentences:日本の朝食といえば、ご飯にお味噌汁でしょう  When you talk about Japanese breakfast, rice and miso shiru must come in to the pcture.私は、家ではたいていジーンズにTシャツを着ています。  I mostly wear jeans and T-shirt around the house.My text book’s explanation of both these sentences is 「N1とN2の組み合わせ」which might work in the same way as:セーターとスカートを組み合わせる｜match a sweater [and a skirt / with a skirt]But this does seem as good as パンにバターをぬる. The best I can come up with is changing にto　と in sentences 1 &amp; 2 as follows:日本の朝食といえば、ご飯とお味噌汁を食べるでしょう。私は、家ではたいていジーンズとTシャツを着ています。　Reference: 総まとめ　文法 N1 p110 (I have not managed to find any other references to this.)
I have recently come to the conclusion that the N1 に N2 construction (eg パンにバター）is more common than I thought. It is the only explanation I think of to make grammatical sense of the sentences below. Could somebody confirm I have this right (in bold)  in the following caseなお、本状と行き違いにお支払い済みの場合はお許しください  Please ignore this notice if you have already paid (this card and your payment have crossed)NoteThe following sentence has been removed as に should have been の：相手に言い分もわかったとはいえ、心から納得したわけではない ( "Although I understand were he's coming from, I can't really agree with him.")
I saw this as a comment someone posted on Google+ in response to NHK announcing a show:本気{ほんき}なら地上波{ちじょうは}でやれよ、受信料{じゅしんりょう}返{かえ}せI think it's saying "If this is really what you intend to broadcast, give me back my broadcast fees!"I'm not confident in that, though, because of that よ that comes just before the comma. My translation is more because I can't think of anything else that makes sense.So far as I know, よ is just a for emphasis. As such, I don't know if I've ever really noticed it being used in the middle of a sentence before. If it just emphasis, then we should be able to take it out, like this:本気なら地上波でやれ、受信料返せWhich to me looks incomplete. If I wanted to say in Japanese the same sentiment, I would use ば, like so:本気なら地上波でやれば、受信料返せIs よ in the original sentence serving the same purpose as my ば, or is there something completely different going onWhat exactly is the best translation of the sentence, assuming mine is off
According to a (non japanese, but he spent lots of time in Japan) Aikido teacher I know, this is supposed to represent "an obligation bounding student and teacher".To be honest, I am a bit skeptical. I know that this is the starting part of the name of a specific "Kata" in Iwama Style Aikido (see here for an example) but I wonder if there is some other "esoteric" meaning or figure of speech that I am missing.
All three of these words mean "to start", but what's the difference between them and where are they used

How are times after noon expressed when speaking I assume that if it's obvious from context that it's after noon, then people will just say ５時.But what if it's not obvious from context My textbook (Japanese for Busy People I) suggests 午後５時, but I'm worried the textbook may be teaching how to say what English-speakers think about time in Japanese, rather than what a native Japanese speaker would say. As far as I have observed in Japan, times are often written down in military time, for example 23:59 rather than 11:59 pm. Do people write it down one way and say it in another, or do they sometimes use military time when speakingIf military time isn't used when speaking, how are times after midnight expressed Would ２５：００ be described using 午前 (午前１時), just like 9:00 would
There are a few words, which are written with Kanji imported from China, but where the intended native Japanese meaning would prefer a different choice of Kanji. My favourite examples are雷 vs. 神鳴り (cf. 海鳴り)鶏 vs. 庭鳥向日葵 vs. 日回りDoes there already exist a list of these words If not, can anybody come up with more examplesP.S. Any suggestions for a better title
This is a practice problem from a textbook on natural language processing:やってみよう:ブラウンコーパスのニュースとロマンスの 2 つのジャンルのデータを利用して、どの曜日がもっとも新聞っぽく、どの曜日がもっともロマンチックかを調べてみよう。"Which day of the week is newspaperish"I know what っぽい、新聞、曜日 all mean, but I don't know what 新聞っぽい曜日 means andI know what the problem is asking, it's just such a strange phrase I can't make a translation out of it. You're supposed to count occurrences of the words [Monday, Tuesday, ..., Sunday] from the two text files, news clippings and romance novels, and then just see which genre has the larger relative count of a given 曜日語. I think the conclusion is supposed to be something like "月曜日はロマンチックではなく新聞っぽい曜日だ". But besides this mechanical understanding of the problem, the notion of 新聞っぽい曜日 is hard to translate. The best I can come up with is "the day of the week that is the most readily associated with the type of sentiment that might be typical of newspaper writings". Or maybe this just a poor choice of words on the part of the author
P.S.: I heard that 「生」 (せい) in the word 先生 can be pronounced either as [sei] or as [see]. If it is so, is there any semantic difference between these variants
Are unit abbreviations like mm for millimetres or % for percent used in JapaneseI've seen people translate those two words in to ミリメートル and パーセント respectively and that is what makes me raise this question.
First off, I tried looking at the explanation here. However, the reasons for 我が家 don't seem to apply to 我が身.Here is the excerpt that doesn't seem to apply from Jesse Good's post:The above also applies to 我が母校、我が国、我が家族、我が妻、我が故郷、etc. They all imply that you have a deep relationship, you are proud of them, show affection, etc.Obviously 我が身 is not stated there (possibly intentionally). I'm unsure how it is possible to "have a deep relationship, be proud of, or show affection" to yourself.The sentence that I read:だから、自分のことを、なかなか他人に伝えたり、分かってもらえなくて、悲しい思いや、傷ついたりすることも多く、ああ、なんてぼくは損な性質に生まれついたんだろう、と我が身が腹立たしく、悔しく思ったことも一度ならずあった。What is the purpose of 「我が身」 in this sentence Is it possible for it to simply be substituted with 私自身 Also, what is implied by 「我が」 in 「我が身」 that is different than the 「我が」 in the examples from the link above
I'm unable to understand the difference between 液体 and 流体. Both sound like "fluid" to me, while the latter sounds like "flowing fluid" (if that makes sense). I had thought there was only 気体、液体、and 固体. What is this 流体 and how can it be explained
When translating how does one deal with contrasts best satisfied with English expressions that not the naturally translations from Japanese. In the following example: 現在の株式市場は、日本企業の経営者の正しい戦略や従業員の真摯な勤労に対して*、不当に低い評価しか与えていません。*[したがって、株価は異常に低いと判断しています。]The current stock market is assigning an unjustifiably low value on the dedication of workers and the (correct) strategies adopted by the management of Japanese companies and therefore we consider stock prices to be anomalously low.I wanted to structure  the sentence with "Given that A, B is..." because it allowed me to connect the full phrases before 「に対して」to the after it. However this is not true equivalent of 「に対して」.  Instead I have cheated by putting "correct" in parentheses but I am not sure what best practice would be.
Is there a basic rule for translating negatives/double negatives that do not feel natural in English. The example I have been struggling is as follows:[TOPIXは29年ぶりの安値に沈んでいます。]この株価水準は、経営者が暴走し、保有する資産を全く活かせずに、毎年赤字を垂れ流すという前提でなければ、説明のつかない水準です。[TOPIX has fallen to a 29 year low. ] On the basis that management are not in disarray, assets are being properly used and losses are not being annually hemorrhaged this level cannot be explained.I can think of several ways to express the same view but ultimately (if it is not dumb question) should we just choose what we think is the closest natural equivalentBonus: I have taken a liberty with 暴走, which is not really "disarray" but seems to fit better. Is this commonly accpetable practice
I'm familiar with 「という」 and was somewhat confused why I saw 「のいう」 in the following sentence:人間対応能力は、ドラッカーのいう「他の人間とともに働く能力」のことです。What is the role of 「のいう」 in this sentence Is it incorrect to say 「という」 I thought that 「の」 is possessive, but I'm unsure of what it means when combined with 「いう」.
When are 止める, 停める and 留める read as とめる or とどめる (and in the case of 止める, やめる)I think 止めてください could be read as both やめてください and とめてください, which I think could maybe be translated as "cut it out" and "please stop" in English respectively, but what exactly is the difference in usage and meaning between やめる and とめるIs とどめる usually written in Hiragana, and if not in what contexts do you use that reading rather than the othersWhat exactly is the difference in usage between the three Kanji 止, 停 and 留 (Looking at the Google IME explanation, I think the 止 is used for generic "stop", 停 when used in reference to cars stopping etc. 留 I'm not 100% on, but I think it might have something to do with "making something stay"/"detaining" looking at the Yahoo J-E definition.)
I found this example sentence in grammar book:門の前に車が止まっています。A car is parked in front of the gate.I was told that instead of 止まる,　停まる would be a more accurate fit for "parked".Does that mean the original would mean- "A car is stopped in front of the gate."Furthermore, I was told that the correct way to translate the original English sentence would be門の前に車が停まっています。Looking at that, I wondered the right way to say: "A car is being parked in front of the gate."These are the responses I got from Japanese natives. Please tell me if all of them are correct translations or which one is the most accurate.A car is being parked in front of the gate.門の前に車が停まろうとしています。門の前に車が止まろうとしています。門の前に車が停められつつあります。      (*written language)門の前に車が止められつつあります。      (*written language)門の前に車が駐車しようとしています。門の前に車が今ちょっと停まっています。門の前に車が停められようとしています。I guess I am confused because it is my understanding that -ろうとしています can mean "trying to -" as well is "verb-ing". If 門の前に車が停められつつあります is the most accurate way to translate the sentence, what would be the most common, colloquial wayBonus question- are any of these examples of げんざいしんこうけい【現在進行形】

Closed 8 years ago.I'm trying to translate some Japanese text I found to English (I'm very beginner, and self-learning).There are two columns of Japanese; on the left:私い日本がand on the right:大子きですI divided these columns into blocks, as follow:私い = I (with Hiragana い used to strengthen the "I")日本 = Japanが = and大 = large子 = childき = kiです = copula ("is")So, I'd translate it something like "I'm Japanese, and a large child is the ki", but I'm not sure this is the correct translation.For example, what does き "ki" exactly mean Does it mean spiritual energy And, if so, why it is not written this way 気 And is it correct to consider が as "and" I found on an online dictionary that が can indicate sentence subject (so would Japan be the subject in this case If so, how to reconstruct the phrase)
This question already has an answer here:                                            Closed 8 years ago.Possible Duplicate:と言っても vs とは言え           . Apparently they mean the same thing (although, that being said) and yet there are cases when only one of them can be used. For example: 梅雨とはいえ、これほど雨が続くのも珍しい。
What is the つく used at the end of this sentence友人の仕事は危険で、汚くて、おまけに きついらしい。ちなみにそういう仕事は俗に「３K」と呼ばれている。要するに「き」、すなわち「K」が３つつくというわけだMy friend's work is dangerous, dirty and tough. It is incidentally the kind of work referred to as 3K because, without going into detail it has the characteristics of the three きs　or Ks.(The content of this sentence provide provide challenges for translation but I want to focus on the つく, which could be a big subject in itself but to make this question striaght forward, I wondered, is it 付く as in the following example:この書棚には二つ引き出しが付いている｜This bookcase has two drawers.
Is the って in the following sentence equivalent to 「と」 as in AはBと変わる／違う昔から好きな曲って変わらないみたい。My favourite songs have not changed for many years.Does this mean it is equivalent to the と used for quotations.
So i was reading A dictionary of Basic Japanese Grammar, and in the part where it explains the uses of いる as an auxiliary verb after て、　it says something like that: "(...) Also, verbs like 言う　and　思う with a third person subject require the ~ている　pattern if the sentence expresses a present state. " And then there's this example sentence:ウエストさんは日本語がやさしいと思っている。My question is: why does it have to be 思っている And can i use 思っている aswell when speaking in the first person, or is it wrong
初めて日本に行った時、友達のお母さんが伝統的な和式朝食を作ってくれました。The first time I went to Japan, my friend's mother made me a traditional Japanese breakfast.If I wrote the opening of the sentence in the following manner, how would the meaning change最初に日本に行った時、or最初日本に行った時、In this context, what is the difference between 初めて, 最初に and 最初
I keep running into this symbol: ※What is it, exactly How is it used According to this Wikipedia link on Japanese typographic symbols, this ※ is called 米{こめ} or 米印{こめじるし}. It is used in notes as a reference mark, similar to an asterisk.With that being said, I seem to find it in situations where there is more to it then a simple asterisk, and I'd really like to hear from people who are more familiar with it.The specific example that prompted my question is in my grammar workbook, there are several grammar patterns/points on a page, along with relevant explanations and example sentences. One example sentence goes like this:例文　：　　xxxxxxxxxxxxxx[grammar pattern]。　　※[grammar point variation](I'll give the exact sentence at the bottom, but I thought it would be better to keep it generic as to not confuse the question.)I take it to mean both are valid, but I wonder if it means that the secondary one is not correct. Also, I realize that this may vary from book to book, but I wonder if there is a standard for this sort of thing.The exact sentence was: 今の成績では合格する可能性などありはしない。　　※合格などできはしない
I have the following sentence: 早く行った方が良かったでしょう。Here, if we take it apart we shall have:早く(Adverb) 行った(Verb, Past tense) 方()  が(GA, Subject particle) 良かったでしょう(Verb, Past tense) 。What is the function of 方 in this positionI've read that it can be suffix, suffix of what
In the 7th book of the awesome High School of the Dead, there's this page:The situation is that the main characters, a group of mostly teenagers who are surviving a zombie apocalypse, are walking through a neighbourhood where some of them used to live.The character with the sword, Saeko, says 〈奴ら〉になっているのは君たちの隣人だ……. Meaning, "The people in this area that have turned into zombies are your neighbours..." (Not an exact translation, of course - I'm adding more context to help clarify the situation.) She's saying that she should go forward and be in a position to kill zombies because if the other team members recognize a zombie as someone they used to know, then they might hesitate.Another character, Takashi, who is one of the people who used to live in the area responds ……家族をやれるか／ということですか／必要ならきっとーー. "You mean if we have to kill someone from our family If we have to we'll definitely..."Saeko cuts him off and says [友]{・}[達]{・}[と]{・}[家]{・}[族]{・}[は]{・}[違]{・}[う]{・}[よ]{・}？That's where I get a little bit lost on the nuance. I get that the baseline of what she's saying is, "friends and family are different", which I think can be extrapolated more specifically to, "killing family and killing friends is different."But, because it ends in よ, which to me seems like an assertion, but the sentence also ends with a question mark, I'm not sure if it's a rhetorical question as a statement or a sincere question. As a response, Takeshi thinks to a moment when he had to kill a friend, but since I'm not sure of her statement, I'm not sure of the meaning of his reaction.Is she saying "Killing family and killing friends is different, don't you agree" Meaning that of course, it's different, so you shouldn't think you can just because you had to kill your friend before. Takeshi was able to actually kill his friend, but maybe Saeko is saying killing family is harder.Maybe she's asking "Is killing friends and killing family different" leaving it open for Takeshi to consider the difference. Maybe Takeshi then just reflects on how hard it was to kill his friend, even though he eventually did it, and realizes that killing his family will be a challenge.Or maybe she's saying "What's so different about killing friends and killing family" Meaning both are difficult. Takeshi then remembers killing his friend, and this steels his resolve to face up to killing people he might remember.Or maybe it's something else entirely. Is what Saeko is saying a genuine question What exactly is the subtext of itAlso, her words all have dots beside them, indicating emphasis (my understanding of these kinds of dots is that they're like using italics in English). Is the emphasis for the benefit of the character Takeshi, or for the reader And how does the emphasis impact the meaning
I'm unsure of how to use this word 「キレる」. When I looked up the definition, it says something along the lines of "to get angry" or "to lose one's temper". Where does this word come from I'm somewhat confused at the combination of katakana 「キレ」 + hiragana 「る」. Does the origin of the word explain this
As far as I'm aware this expression means "(a persons) strong points', but I'm not sure how とする is being used in this context. My best guess would be something like "the thing (a person) tries to do best" or something to that effect, but that doesn't really sound right, and I have previously read that the 'try to do' usage is only with volitional form verbs Anyway I'm not very familiar with とする or ところ (I'm fairly beginner level) so I don't feel comfortable making a guess about it. Can anyone explain
Both of them mean fire. But what are the difference between the two For the sentence : There is a fire in my room. Can I use both of them And what about for the sentence : Fire is part of the 5 elements.
The other day at some festival a few japanese friends asked me something to the effect ofアイスを買ってくるけど、行く？But I had already asked a friend, who had not yet returned, to get some for me.  So I saidジェームズがもう買って来てくれたので大丈夫。What I intended to say in English was "No thanks, James already went to get me some."But it seems that the japanese version of that statement could have multiple meanings.  How do I differentiate between "He already bought it for me (and has completed this process)" and　"He has already gone to buy it for me (and has not yet completed this action)"(もう買ってきてくれている could be a possibility, but for some reason doesn't sound correct to me.  )
I've previously asked about あっての, but now it seems to me that I've run into an additional usage of it (or perhaps the same usage I just can't wrap my head around it...).When the sentence is simply AあってのB, it seems pretty straightforward. For example: あなたあっての私なんです。I think means: "I wouldn't be here without you" This sentence, however is more confusing to me:子供あっての我が家である。Does this mean:"Our family wouldn't be here without the children/if not for the children" Or is it more like: "Our family exists for the (benefit of the) children"Or even:"If we never had children, we wouldn't be a family"
I often hear Japanese males use the word お袋 in place of お母さん when annoyed or irritated. Is this word slang How did this word come to mean 「お母さん」 and what are the circumstances it is used inI am also interested in why the word 「袋」is chosen to address the mother. What is the importance of this word
I know the phrase 我が家 means "our home" or "our family". My question is when would you use it, as opposed to say 私の家　or 私の家族 It seems poetic to me, or something that wouldn't exactly be used in everyday conversation.
This is a two part question, both pertaining to expressions involving "必要".What is the difference between 必要がある and -なくてはいけない/ -なければならない Thedifference between the latter two expressions is explained inthisquestion, but I'm still unclear as to where "[必要]{ひつよう}がある" comes into play(e.g. if it is synonymous with one or both of those, or if itcarries a different nuance altogether).I need to do my homework.  宿題をしなくてはいけません。  宿題をする必要があります。What is the difference between (noun)が[必要]{ひつよう}です and (noun)が[要]{い}ります  Unlike the expressions in question number one, these expressions are used when expressing the necessity of an object or　thing.I need a new motherboard.  新しいマザーが必要です。  新しいマザーが要ります。
I have a sentence フライト・アテンダントはよく話しかけてくれて親しみがありました。Where 話しかけて is what I can't understand. What sort of suffix is "shikakete" Or is it two suffixes, shi + kakete
I've seen 上で quite a few times recently, in contexts like:In the cloudクラウド上でand：On the computerコンピュータ上In this case, is it pronounced うえ, as in クラウドうえで, or じょうSilly little question, but none of the tools I have (rikaichan etc) help me to find the answer. If there's a better way I could have found the answer, please let me know!
I'm having trouble understanding the best way to respond to someone asking "why".My study guide advised,To answer the question with "why", make a statement sentence that indicates the reason and add からです at the end,  A:　どうして昼ご飯を食べなかったんですか　  　B:　ダイエットをしているからですFeeling like it couldn't possibly be that simple, I went looking to see if anyone had explained things in more detail.However, nearly every sentence with から I found are sentences that describe both the cause and response, seemingly not as a response to a "why" question, such as this sentence taken from another postあのラーメン屋は人を待たせるから、行かないことにした。 I haven't been able to find much at all on からです in direct response to a question, as it was in my book's example.I figured the most likely reason for this was eitherA. からです is a nonstandard approach and my book is weird, orB. I've missed something.Unfortunately, B prompted me to wonder if some of these descriptions actually were a direct response that I was misunderstanding.So, while I was searching for something likeA：　どうして外に行かなかったんですか   B：　雨が降っていたからですPeople were actually sayingA：　どうして外に行かなかったんですか   B：　雨が降っていたから、外に行きませんでしたIn short, is something like "ダイエットをしているからです" actually a standard way to give a reason in response to a questionIf not, what would be more appropriateAny other ways to give a reason are welcome, because nuance is neat.
Is there any difference between the words 格好 and 恰好 Can I actually call them different words, or is it that they are just the same word written differently I've been told that they have exactly the same meaning by a native, but possibly someone here might know a difference.In the sentence:朝みた時と同じ恰好で立っていた。Would there be any difference in replacing the compound with 格好 If not, then why are there two currently existent "words" for the same concept
I came across the phrase 甘いものに目がない which roughly translates to "having a sweet tooth". Then I wondered why 目がない refers to "something that you like". Is there an explanation for why "having no eyes" means to "like something"
I have the sentence:この国に生まれ老い、良かったと死んでゆける高齢化社会。This is the first time I've seen 「死んでゆける」 or 「ゆける」. What does it mean Is this a grammatical form I also tried looking up more examples with 「ゆける」here, but there are only a few, and I'm not able to derive the meaning yet.
I keep coming across this word often 「自己PR」when looking at applications. I'm not sure what the "PR" part means in Japanese, but in English it usually means "public relations". What does this word mean, and what does the "PR" stand for
For example, in this sentence:彼は、失敗をものともせず、 何度もくりかえし 挑戦し続けた。くりかえし is modified by 何度も, implicitly stating that the action was repeated multiple times. My question is that if the sentence was rearranged like so:彼は、 何度も失敗  をものともせず、くりかえし挑戦し続けた。does くりかえし then imply that the action was repeated only once (while the failures were multiple)Are there other ways to indicated the amount or frequency of repetitions (perhaps other than just with adjectives/adverbs)Bonus question: Does the first sentence indicate the "he" failed only once
What is the difference between and how can we explain the grammar in the expressions for "follow" in the examples below  子供が母親のあとをついていく   (A child is following his/her mother)母親の買い物についていく (go shopping with mother)彼の考えにはついていけない  (I can't go along with his idea)彼の後をつける (I follow/tail him-see also * below)I wondered if this was because:についていく　allows the subject to "attach itself to the object" and move after it (grammatically this works well because both are intransitive)後をつく and 後をつける　are both idioms　whereby: つける　can only be used with あと ("mark left behind") and as a transitive verb takes を to mark the object？つく　is intransitive so grammatically を is used "spatially" as in 信号を曲がる〜ついていく can only be used when there is continuous movement/"one journey", as opposed to say a child following its mother 24 hours a day who will start and stop/"make several journeys"References/notes on examples 1-4: All can be found in 総まとめ　語彙　N2-p132 (ex1-3)   N1-p100 (ex4); *Example 4 also appears in the Apple dictionary as: こっそり人 (の後) を付ける｜follow a person secretly / shadow [stalk / ｟口｠tail] a personOr (long shot suggestion):- Is the つく verb the same in all cases (last week I noticed that 付く　is intransitive but  吐く as in うそをつく is transitive.)Update to reflect two answers received as of 28 Aug 12:To summarise answers received, there are two explanations:Explanation 1:The main difference b/w the examples can be explained by the difference b/w あとに &amp; あとを:後に is a temporal/spatial use of を. Essentially the follower is following the same course as the object but not necessarily at the same time. 跡を　is a physical (or if emotionally used, metaphorical) use: the followers moves behind the object of its pursuit in "lockstep", speeding up and slowing down to maintain the same distance. Regarding use of つくvsつける： 後をつく is ungrammatical because つく is intransitive but the ついていく in 後をついていくis thought of as independent transitive verb, taking 後 as object. (つける is a transitive verb and can take the object あとを）Explanation 2 (Revised):The main pts of this explanation was proposed after referring to the explanation 1 (above):（～の後を）ついて行く is defined as "trail", and it classifies this usage with を as being intransitive (【自動】). It might literally be "follow someone's behind".(人）の後について行く is defined as "tread in someone's footsteps"/"tread in the steps of", and ～の後について行く is listed as "follow" and classifies this usage with に as being transitive (【他動】). 後をつける is used for shadowing/tailing and 跡をつける leaving traces,Explanation 3 [Original Explanation 2]:When the particle に is used the person being followed is the main actor in the sentence.When the particle を is used the main actor in the sentence is unchanged.This is similar to the difference b/w に伴う and を伴う(Although this was explanation was replaced, I have kept it here for reference as I think it still has credibility.)Any further comments or input are welcome.
There is a generally expressed rule in Japanese that, when declaring existence, いる is used for animate subjects, and ある is used for inanimate subjects. There are some interesting variations in what is considered to be animate, but there's one very well known exception to these rules.私は子どもがXある - I have X children/As for me, there are X children.いる is preferred in this sentence, but ある is permissible. I have heard the acceptability of ある in the above explained in two ways.Children are "de-personified" in this structure, either because of linguistic humility or some other reason. In this case, intransitive ある maintains the usual distinction of working only with inanimate/non-moving subjects.This is actually a different ある verb from the existence variant. In this case, ある is a transitive possessive verb meaning "to have, to own".Either of these explanations will work, but moving outside of this specific sentence presents me with a problem.I have recently read that×私は運転手があるis not acceptable, even if 運転手 refers to a permanent servant working for the 私 in the above sentence. Why is thisI would think it would be at least as acceptable to de-personify one's own servants as one's children. Rather obviously explanation 2 (possession) should allow this construction as well. What distinguishes these two uses of aru
I saw a film where in two separate scenes the characters seemed to use the "imperative-prohibition" to invite the opposite action:1.In one scene a father after explaining something to his son appeared to ask his son if he could understand what he had explained:「わかるな」？It was as if he had said: 「[おれのいうこと]、分かりませんか」？2.In another scene a woman invited a child to sit on a chair that she was pointing at:「すわんな」As if she had said: 「座りませんか」In both cases I am sure I have quoted the subtitles correctly but is this really the imperative prohibition or have I missed something
This quesion:と言っても vs とは言え           .reminded me of a similar case:どっちにしても vs どっちにしろwhich are also synonymous as far as I can tell.That got me thinking:Is this coincidental Are there other cases where the imperative is used instead of the conditional formulation Has this replacement ever been productive
Specifically for when they mean "a little".In what situations would they be used and are they completely interchangeable without any differences
I am aware of these words that mean "butterfly":[蝶]{ちょう} 蝶々 (Is the alternate form of チョウチョ more common than 蝶々 Because 蝶々 would be チョウチョウ instead and it seems ウ is removed because of shortening)[胡]{こ}蝶バタフライ (I think this is mainly used in the context of swimming; バタフライで泳ぐ, and in the context of chaos theory; バタフライ効果. Can it be used for the insect)Which is most commonly used to generally refer to the insect And when are the less common (if any) forms used What are their nuances if any
I'm quite familiar with the different uses of the particles に and　で. However, right now I'm stuck, because I want to say the following in Japanese, and as I understand it, either one of these particles could provide the appropriate adverbial meaning if attached to the end of 楽しみ.I would like to say in Japanese:I will explain [i.e., make an explanation] it [to you] with pleasure.Which one of the following is correct楽しみに説明します。　or   楽しみで説明します。
I often hear both of the following phrases:彼氏が出来る彼氏を作るBoth of them seem to mean the same thing(). Why is it that 作る is used in this way I had previously thought 作る meant to "create" or "make" something. Does this mean that the two phrases differ
Do the following expressions:(もうすこし）上手にでき ないものかI wish I could get a bit better.(どうにか）直せ ないものかI wish I could somehow fix it.(なんとか）でき ないものか I wish we could somehow do something.  (or: "hmm, I wonder if we can't somehow do something..")mean:A. "I can't ~", B. "I wish I could ~ (but I can't)", orC. "I can't ~ but wonder if I could~ (if I tried harder/thought a bit more a bit more about it)"How does the addition/removal of (i) the expressions in brackets (もうすこし／どうにか／なんとか), (ii) だろう（ie　~ものだろうか） and (iii) context in which the expression is used change the meaningI ask because normally a sentence ending in ~ものか is a strong denial (or does this only apply when attached to a verb in plain affirmative form (eg 似合うもんか, "It doesn't suit you").　 The translations are my own/taken from my notes for reference but I am not confident about conveying the correct impression when I used these terms. Supplementary question: How is this used in polite speech Can ~ものですか　be used
From what I can tell they both mean "Because of", and the only differences in meaning I can see seem to be very subtle.あっての:Because of A (strong emphasis), BThanks to (various things), (outcome)とあって:Because of A, BBecause ~; ~ as expected; because ~, naturally ~As far as I can tell, the only difference is that あっての proceeds and follows a noun, while とあって can proceed and follow a sentence. Is there some other difference between these
The verbs ひらく　and あける both mean to open, and  とじる　and しめる both mean to close. I understand that ひらく and とじる are antonym pairs, as are あける and しめる, but have never been clear on the difference between them. I have heard it explained in several different ways, but have come across several cases which seem to refute them. Some of the explanations I have seen are:ひらく/とじる refer to an abstract or figurative opening or closing, such as opening a store, account, or ceremony. あける/しめる are literally opening or closing something (physically).ひらく/とじる are opening or closing something in 3 dimensions (such as a laptop or a car door),   where あける/しめる are only used when the opening/closing action only spans one dimension (such as a sliding window or a Japanese style closet).On the other hand, I have seen buttons on an elevator say ひらく and とじる (which refutes #2). I have never heard ひらく or とじる applied to a door--it's always あける/しめる, whether it's a hinged or a sliding door. I have always heard あける / しめる used when referring to the opening of a store or business (e.g. レストランはあけていますか。). What is the difference between these termsAnd as a secondary question, is ひらく both transitive and intransitive
Can someone explain what rules for が come in play that make the sentence:発売延期となっていたネットワークレコーダー「nasne(ナスネ)」の発売が8月30日に決定しましたgrammatically correct I would have formulated it 「nasne(ナスネ)」の発売が8月30日に決定されました,　or to keep the usage of しました-form:　ソニーは「nasne(ナスネ)」の発売を8月30日に決定しました
When referring to a celebrity or historical figure, do you use -さんI am listening to Yoko Shimomura.  Would it be:"下村陽子さんを聞いている。" Abraham Lincoln is my favorite president.  Would it be: "エイブラハム・リンカーンは一番好きな大統領。"I have seen celebrities' and famous people's names in texts and references without any honorifics, but it feels strange to use someone's name whom I've never met before without saying -さん, especially when using their full name.Another case would be if a celebrity goes by a mononym (e.g. Beethoven) or a pseudonym (e.g. Sting). Is it customary to use -さん or some honorific title when referring to them Or is it only appropriate in certain situations
My dictionary defines both 防止 and 予防 as "prevention", with 予防 having the additional definitions of "precaution" and "protection against".I sort of understand the latter definitions for 予防 as acting to stop something which is happening from getting worse, which explains its use in medicine, but I've also seen 予防 used in the "prevention" sense similar to 防止.  For example, from the Tanaka Corpus:森林火災の防止はすべての人が負う義務です。  The prevention of forest fires is everyone's responsibility.今週は火災予防週間です。  This is Fire Prevention Week.交通事故の防止対策を講じなければならない。  We must take measures to prevent traffic accidents.予防運転は事故を防ぎます。  Defensive driving can help you avoid accidents.鶏卵生産におけるサルモネラ汚染を防止することが必要です。  It is essential to prevent salmonella contamination in hen egg production.予防は治療にはるかにまさる。  Prevention is much preferable to cure. [sic]In what situations is it preferable to use 防止 over 予防  What are the nuances that govern the choice of one word over the other
I remember being told that hiragana should be the same size as kanji when writing them by hand. However, there are times when I see handwritten kana that are much smaller than the kanji. Does this carry any nuance or is there any purpose to it

In my JLPT practice book, there is a question that asks you to put words in the correct order:朝の満員電車の中で、大きな音で　____ ____ ____ ____ 若者がいる。What I put down was:朝の満員電車の中で、大きな音で 迷惑きわまりない音楽を聞いている 若者がいる。But the correct answer is:朝の満員電車の中で、大きな音で 音楽を聞いている迷惑きわまりない 若者がいる。From what I can tell, it seems that the first sentence is saying that it is the music that is annoying, and the second sentence is that the kids are annoying, but I do not see why one is any more grammatically correct than the other.

Part 1I understand 探す to be to search for something (general)and 捜す to be to search for something lostBut do people actually care about the difference in nuance when they use itI mean do people use them interchangeably like using 捜す for searching (general) and  探す for searching for something lostPart 2Do japanese school children learn the kanji 捜す first or 探す
When I look at them in the dictionary, they all mean the same thing. How to know which one to useIf I want to say: "Generally, I go to school by bus" or "Generally, people grow taller" or even "Generally, I like cats", which one should I use Or can several of them be used for the same sentenceExamples would be much appreciated.Edit: Okay, some of the sentences I gave lack context. Here would be the entire sentence:"Generally, people grow taller but some suffers from dwarfism""Generally, I like cats but this one is horrible"
In the context of native Japanese speakers (not non-natives), is there a concept that roughly translates as "kanji illiteracy" If so, what are the Japanese terms for it Also, what does it mean Does it mean not being able to distinguish kanji apart, not knowing the readings, or not knowing the meanings Can it also mean people who are unable to write kanji, being reliant on IMEs and producing lots of 誤変換Background: Episode 5 of 古代少女ドグちゃん had Das Kapital being deployed to un-brainwash some exploited workers in a crab-meat factory (presumably a reference to 蟹工船). It worked on the older workers, but the younger workers were not un-brainwashed, and the heroes deployed the まんがで読破 (Manga de Dokuha) version, saying "the pressure-free education kanji-illiterate can understand it," according to a D-Addicts fansub.Related question: How do I differentiate all these terms for "illiterate" talks about illiteracy, but doesn't seem to mention kanji in particular.Edit: The term turned out to be kanji yomenai (漢字読めない). (Thanks nkjt先生!) Edited the title so it's more informative.
Why is the direct object taking を in (1) and に in (2) What are basic rules that drive these two sentence constructions(1) 叔母は父を頼っている  'My aunt is counting on my father's help.'(2) 農民は収入を[牧羊]{ぼくよう}に頼っていた  'The farmers depended on sheep-farming as their source of income.'I am not sure of the technical terms but there is clearly a bit more going in (2). However the farmers in (2) are relying on sheep farming in the same way that my aunt is relying on my father in (1). I think (1) could be amended as (3) to comply with the same grammatical rules as (2):  (3) 叔母は援助を父に頼っている  'My aunt is counting on my father for support.'but I still do not understand how/when/what grammatical rules are being used.

I recently looked at the disambiguation page for Andrew on the Japanese Wikipedia, and found that there were several "アンドルー"s, and several "アンドリュー"s. I couldn't discern any trend that one form tended to be from an earlier time period and the latter was from a later time period, or that one form was from certain languages and the other was from other languages.Are both forms considered normal transcriptions of "Andrew", or is one form considered more normal than the other
Is it ok to put さん after an internet handle, such as a twitter name or a usernameMy suspicion is that you'd avoid adding さん if it'd confuse the software, and that addressing someone by their internet handle at all would be too casual in formal situations, but that otherwise you'd add さん or whatever honorific was appropriate.
Did any writing systems, or even failed attempts at them, exist for Japanese before kanji was imported from China
What is the logic behind the similar sounding expressions 後へ引く and 後を引く Are they idioms Apple dictionary lists these examples:後へ引くもう後へは引けない  'It's too late to turn back now.'   'We're in too deep to back out now.'後を引く1 影響が残る傷の痛みがいつまでも後を引いている  'The pain of the wound [won't go away / still lingers].'あの事件の後遺症がいまだに後を引いている  'The aftereffects of that incident are still being felt.'2 次々に欲しくなるこのクラッカーは食べ出すと後を引く  'Once I start eating these crackers, I can't stop.'The idiomatic meanings don't quite fit the individual words or similar idioms (eg 潮が引く "the tide goes out" or 事故が後を絶たない "there continue[s] to be [no end to the] accidents").
I imagine that in じゃんけんぽん, けん corresponds to 拳 which I interpret as "fist" which is "rock".Do じゃん and ぽん correspond to "scissors" and "paper" If not, then do the individual parts of じゃん, けん and ぽん mean anything on their own or are they derived from another word
I read that ... to ii na to omoimasu means "I hope that ...". Is the na here a final particle that adds the first person's subjective feeling to the proposition as in sawa’s answer to using なafterい-adjectives
When I tried to use ～かねない to express my own feeling about a situation, I was told by a native that it sounds incorrect and strange. However, ～かねる is appropriate and fine. For example, this is the impression I get of what is going on.彼が本当のことを言っているとは信じかねる  (the speaker thinks it's hard to believe he's telling the truth)彼が本当のことを言っていると信じかねない  (the speaker thinks he's probably not telling the truth, yet others think he is)However, I was told that ～かねない cannot directly refer to the speaker's opinion, but to can refer to someone else. For the second example, is it true that you must directly reference a different party Why is that
I seem to have a hard time recognizing when to choose either にわたって or を通じて in the following question:この地方は一年（　　）暖かく、とても過ごしやすい。The correct answer is を通じて. My idea is that を通じて would make this say "throughout this year". With にわたって, I thought that it would be "Over the course of one year". Yet, I'm thinking that these are incorrect. What is the difference between these two words with respect to time Also, what would be the correct translation for this phrase
In response to my question about くすぐったい, I was told of the specific suffix in use, the "ったい."  What is this ったい / -ttai suffix called in English and in Japanese (or what would one call it if it does not have a specific name) What exactly does it connote Would someone be kind enough to provide me with a brief list of Japanese words using this suffix (I found Dono's romanization hard to understand {sorry})
I am interested in the literal meaning of くすぐったい. If くすぐったい is equivalent to the English expression, "That tickles!" (said by someone being tickled), what is the literal meaning of this word If it is an adjective stemming from the verb くすぐる, would it literally mean "I want to tickle!" Is there a logic behind the use of the -tai form adjective ( expressing desire ) that I am not getting
I am trying to understand the title of an anime series called: Naruto Shippuden. Searching google, I found that shippuden can be translated as hurricane chronicles or legend. I looked for hurricane in the English wikipedia, and afterwards went to the Japanese version.熱帯低気圧（ねったいていきあつ、英: Tropical Cyclone）Can someone explain why 疾風伝 whould be translated as hurricane chronicles
My understanding is that ものだ is used to assert things which are mostly known to everyone.誰かの家に招待されたときは、何か手土産をもっていくものだ  'When invited to somebody's home it's customary to bring presents'.On the other hand, ことだ is used to give someone advice.A: どうすれば日本語が早く簡単に上達しますか。  B: 上手になりたいなら、真面目にコツコツ勉強することです。それ以外に方法はありません。I can understand that B gives an advise to A, however B is not really saying anything that A couldn't already know. Moreover, when talking about what to do when going to somebody's home, "bring presents" is not necessarily something that everybody is aware of - could be that some cultures are used to bringing money.So it seems to be that, in the examples above, ものだ and ことだ are can be freely exchanged. Note, that the examples are from my textbook so i guess they can't be exchanged.
In all the japanese learning books, they teach you that xxxday ends with 曜日.But sometimes I get to see xxx曜 only without the "Day" Kanji.Can I shorten it when speaking too or is it only written  And when can I shorten it
Can the topic marker は be used twice in a sentence For example, かれは日本語はいいですね。　Is that right
Why were the terms 外回り and 内回り chosen for the directions on Yamanote line (railway)  rather than the more straigntforward 時計回り and 反時計回り Is it expected that people should know which matches which
It is likely that this is due to my poor understanding, but why are there so many names for「すし」 I think for the most part I have only seen the first three (寿司、鮨、鮓). For whatever reason in some restaurants in America there are these other compositions listed. Something tells me that their is some nuance between them or not all of them are in use. What are the differences between these words, and why are there so many
When can I safely say 「行ってきます」when leaving home or another place How loosely can this phrase be used Can you use it even if you don't plan to come back until a day/week/month later If it is going to be an extended period that a person is gone (from home), is there another a better phrase to use or is「行ってきます」still appropriateFor the sake of the question, let's assume that the listener knows that the person is leaving, and they also know how long that person will be gone.
What is the difference between the two words こぼれる and あふれるI think for こぼれる, the focus is on improper or bad containment leading to overflow/spillage. And for あふれる the focus is on the abundance of the object being contained, therefore leading to overflow/spillage.As an aside, how frequently is the kanji 溢 used for あふれる and こぼれる I ask this because Google IME suggests 溢れる for both あふれる and こぼれる. Is あふれる usually in kana and こぼれる usually 零れる
While looking up the denonym for a Kansai resident (I've since found out it's 関西人{かんさいじん}), jisho.org described 才六, 贅六, 上方才六, 賽六 and 采六, with pronunciations (not necessarily in that order) of ぜいろく, ぜえろく, かみがたざいろく, and さいろく as being (presumably related) words used to debase people from Kansai.What did these words mean
While reading this bit of news, I noticed that the article used an interesting type of "honorific":京都大学院薬学研究科の辻本豪三・元教授（５９）が医療機器販売会社（東京都世田谷区）から私的な旅行費用などの肩代わりを受けていた問題で [...]Although the 元教授【もときょうじゅ】 fragment appears on its own elsewhere (for example in the title), it also follows every occurrence of the disgraced former professor's name (3 times in this short article), in what would seem to be the chosen honorific to address him.My question(s) are then:Is the -元+[former address] form of honorific standard and commonly used Would any former prime minister be 元総理大臣 Does the form carry any negative nuance E.g would it be used in cases where the term/position ended normally (in this instance, the professor obviously resigned in disgrace, but what if he had just been a retired professor)Any reason why the journalist would use this particular form rather than either a standard "civilian" -様 or the usual legal suffixes (-容疑者 etc) (the insistence on pointing out his fall from grace seems a little petty to my untrained eye)
Where in your body is [心]{こころ} locatedWhen people refer to [心]{こころ} do they refer to their heart or brain I assume heart as the literal translation, but I've heard both so was wondering what the answer is.For example, there is the expression [心]{こころ}に[浮]{う}かぶ which seems to me like it would be referring to your brain rather than your heart, is there a distinction between this usage and other usagesCLARIFICATIONI realize the [心]{しん} can refer to your heart, as in [心臓]{しんぞう}. However, my question is about the word こころ not しん.
Not sure if this is a noun or a na-adjective but is something like 好きながら, 貧乏ながら, 親切ながら, 貧弱ながら, et cetera, a general grammar pattern of noun or na-adjective + ながらWhat I mean is, do all these work, or will they always work for a given noun or na-adjective
The phrase is: mada minu kimi e tsudzuku. I believe the kana is: まだ見ぬきみへつづく。

I have this book 「図解でわかる　文字コードのすべて」 which lists many of the Unicode and JIS symbols that one can type. I noticed the section of enclosed alphanumerics (囲み文字). Not all kanji are included in 囲み文字 which leads me to believe that some have special meanings.For example:㊑ probably stands for 株式会社However, I have no clue what ㊯ would indicate or be used for.Some of them are obvious, yet others are not. Is there a resource that exists for how these 囲み文字 are used along with the context and meaning Also, how is it that certain characters are chosen to be included in 囲み文字 and others not
I came across this phrase in the sentence:勘【かん】というものは、しょちゅう経験【けいけん】していながら、どことなくつかみどころがなく、いまの科学【かがく】ではまだその正体【しょうたい】が、明らか【あきらか】にされていない。(Soumatome N1 dokkai, p45)My best effort to translate it naturally would be: "Although we all often experience intuition, it is an intangible phenomenon that modern science has yet to explain. "But this is a guess with some added words.  The expression can be googled as 'it is slippery in some way'.Does anybody know this expression (or can suggest a good reference for such expressions)
For some reason, I have had the impression that か at the end of a sentence marks some kind of question that is being asked. However, in these examples from 日本語総まとめ　文法:うれしいもんですか。困っているんです。(I'm not at all pleased. I am not in a good situation.)デジカメが壊れた。なんとか直らないものだろうか。(My digital camera is not working. I wish I knew how to fix the problem.)It appears to not be an adequate or translation of the grammatical forms. The first example doesn't seem to explain the existence of any question (if one exists). The second one might be better translated as: "My digital camera is broken. I wonder if something cannot be done to fix it."I thought this conveys the idea of something being questionable. How would the first example be better explained/translated so that whatever is questionable is not lost
I checked Japanese Wikipedia and お天道様 is an early Edo period word for the sun, as used in some kind of early modern popular religion that is not really described well at all. Anyway, I've never seen a word like this in any children's book, so how do kids know what their grandparents are talking about It seems like if it's a word nobody understands, the grandparents should just say お日様 instead.
Japanese verbs are quite complex compared to English verbs (Most English verbs have five or six forms and to be has eight not including archaic forms). Their agglutinative nature means they have various parts which can be present or not, or can take different morphemes.What I'm wondering is if it is possible to calculate the total number of possible forms this can lead to for a typical Japanese verb.If it's not straightforward or generally talked about, a reference to a discussion or research paper would also be a great answer.
If you look at my translation of the sentence below from a text book (総まとめ N3 読解), I think you will agree that I have guessed the meaning correctly but can anyone explain the grammar to the first phrase in bold  The particle も seems to have a wider usage than that given in most books or perhaps there is an omitted phrase「かわいい写真たてもうれしかった けれど、それより、  黙ってプレゼントを用意してくれていたことに感激した。」"I was very happy with the photoframe () but more than that,   I was touched that she prepared a present secretly, without revealing anything." Context: This was an entry to a young woman's diary, trying to think of a nice birthday present for her friend.
What is the translation of はこう  (from はこうやって)I know that it would mean something like : This is how (I do) ...Yet, I cannot find the word in any dictionary. I just find the meaning of "wave height".
I'm totally puzzled as to what this means, and I couldn't find any helpful hints when I searched through multiple websites. Does anyone else have a clue
According to this post, the に in 一緒に makes this an adverb. Which means that 一緒 is an adjective. But when can 一緒 ever be (or be used as) an adjective  一緒人 (conjoined twins, a couple, best friends connected at the hip) Note: I have no idea if 一緒人 is an actual word or even grammatically correct. It was just something random I threw out there.
I thought of this after seeing a news article about 星出{ほしで}彰彦{あきひこ}, who is an astronaut.Aptronym is a term for a name (often the surname) that fits a person's occupation or personality. A classic example is "Igor Judge" (a British judge, also known as Lord Judge), but the name doesn't have to be precisely the same as the occupation, for example, a florist with the surname "Flowers" or a chef with the surname "Spoon" would count.In English the term "aptronym" is not widely used (I think it was relatively recently coined) but phrases such as "aptly named~" "fittingly named~" "an apt name" "a fitting name" might be.  In Japanese, how would one best describe a name that fits the ownerI had one thought:仕事にぴったりな名前I have found some indications that this is possible including one direct mention of 星出さん:On the blog of a ikebana instructor called 花香, she mentions often getting the comment 「お花の仕事にぴったりな名前ですね」星出さんなんて 宇宙飛行士{うちゅうひこうし}にぴったりな名前 (on twitter)However I'd like to know if there are other terms (ふさわしい？合う？) that are used, and if there is a coined term like "aptronym" used in Japanese. Famous examples (real or fictional) would also be welcome.
I understand that a kanji can have several possible readings and several (typically related) meanings. Furthermore, I've noticed that a single reading typically corresponds to some subset of the meanings. To give a brief example:生 can mean "birth", "genuine", or "life" (according to Kanjidic)Pronounced せい it means "life", "living"Pronounced なま it means "raw", "natural", etc.Pronounced いき it means "lively"Pronounced うむ (生む) it means "to give birth", "to produce"Pronounced なる (生る) it means "to bear fruit" etc.Is there any resource (book/website/database/etc.) which matches readings to meanings Bonus points if the resource is easily machine-readable - I'm building some software for which the data would be valuable.
I am unable to locate objects and their orientation with respect to myself when 向こう and 向かい are used.Consider: 向こう側向かい側向こうの店向かいの店Where is 向こう側 and 向かい側 with respect to me Are they the same placeMy current hypothesis is that 向こう and 向かい both may occupy the same place, except that 向かい necessarily orientates the object to face the subject (either the first person, or from some place's perspective which the first person adopts) by either the having a "front side" or by assuming that the object has a "front side".
One of my grammar books 日本語総まとめN2 文法 lists both of the grammar forms 「きっかけに」 and 「契機に」 in the same definition.However, in the example question a choice is given between them:その事件（a. の契機に b. をきっかけに)、商品の検査体制が見直された。The book lists "b" as the correct answer, yet I'm still puzzled as to why either of them would be more appropriate than the other. Is it the case that 「契機に」 has a much more limited/specific use compared to the other

This question is the result of a conversation with Chocolate in chat, and also this Japanese calendar I have that lists the months according to the traditional Japanese names. For some reason, there exists some discrepancy about the literal meaning of 水無月 and 神無月. What is the correct meaning verbatim as it relates to the Japanese language other than that these are specific months (I am not asking for names "June" and "October").One translation due to the 無 character acting as a "negative identifier"() (否定の接頭語) meaning "nothing/non/un/not" and such:神無月 - "the month when there are no gods"水無月 - "the month when there is no water"A second translation exists stating that 無 acts as an ateji (当て字, 宛字) for 「な/の」. This would result in a slightly different meaning:神無月 - "the month of gods"水無月 - "the month of water"It seems that there are a variety of sources that take either side. What would be the appropriate literal meaning for each of these words In addition, does 無 act as an 当て字 or as 否定の接頭語
I would like to know when do you use the word 回答{かいとう} versus the word 応答{おうとう}. Based on my understanding they 回答 is reply while 応答 is response. Although to reply would also mean to response, in English though.I usually misused 回答 when naming on describing the response on programming request and response specification. It should be 応答 instead. Can you use 応答 as a verb like 応答する While when referring to email or telephone you use 回答.Is there a general rule on using this two
I've seen people trying to define it in many places, but all of them end up giving different versions or saying it can't be defined.
This is more than likely due to my lack of reading enough Japanese; however, in this sentence the particles と and に are placed together which I haven't seen before.Sentence:一時は観光と買い物とに集中していた外国旅行ツアーも近頃はもっと細かくなって、音楽を聴く旅、城をまわる旅というようにある趣味の目的を持つ旅行計画もできてきた。Is there an underlying reason for the と in this sentence Would the sentence be the same with removing the second と
Yesterday, I mentioned the fact that I was grateful for having someone play music for me, and letting me play music as well.  I first said something like:ピアノを弾いてもらったり、弾かせてもらったりして、嬉しいです。Then, I thought that since I was using twice "もらったり," I should be able to factorise it and express the same opinion:ピアノを弾いたり、弾かせたりしてもらって、嬉しいです。Then, I was told that the sentence was now incorrect.  It seems to me that this is perfectly correct, as far as grammar goes. So, is it correct/acceptable, or is it again one of those "no one says it, so it's not correct" sentences
Why is  口が軽い the opposite of 口が堅い  It seems interesting to me why 軽い／堅い would be chosen for this phrase. As far as I know, most of the time phrases that are coupled with 軽い usually have the opposite meaning paired with 重い. I know one case where it is paired with 激しい as in 軽く／激しく運動する. What would be the reason as to why 口が重い might not be the appropriate choice to use for the opposite phrase of 口が軽い
I think this is a question I should have asked a long time ago.. What is the difference between 案外 and 意外 What does the correct situation look like when using eitherExample with 案外:人生は案外短いものです。ですから、こんなにも貴重な人生を、自分が満足できない仕事で無駄にしているなんて、驚くべきことです。Example with 意外:意外なことに、とてもうまくいってます。The English translation definitely didn't help me with this one, as both are "unexpectedly". Is there a certain degree that is associated with each

What is the difference for word compounds that can exist with 送り仮名 and without and still retain the same pronunciationAs an example:巻き貝　と　巻貝取り引き　と　取引If I'm correct, both of these are pronounced 「まきがい」 and 「とりひき」. Do they mean the same thing If so, what would be a good reason for choosing one over the other. Also, how did it come about to be this wayThe only reason I could guess that both exist is because 「取り引き」 makes the reader pronounce it a specific way without leaving anything to question, but please correct me if this is incorrect.

I looked it up and found that it's the difference between "one" and "one thing," but how could you have known that without specifically looking it up I'm looking to learn whether there is a pattern to the significance of okurigana.Also, when are the kun readings of numerals used if you count with on readings
In reference to Japanese sweets (わらび餅), I found this sentence:見た目も透明感があり、涼しげで夏にピッタリです。Its clear and cool appearance makes it perfect for summer.Is 涼しげで two words涼しい　＋　で？Could I also write the sentence this way, or would it make it grammatically incorrect or change the meaning見た目も透明感があり、涼しくて夏にピッタリです。
Just something as simple as the character for "one" has the On readings "ichi" and "itsu." So how would I know which one to use if I saw this as part of a compound
Here is my present state of understanding:A kanji's meaning is the same regardless of reading.A reading is a way of speaking the kanji out loud.Kun readings are always used when the kanji appears alone, except apparently with numerals, and with those kanji which lack Kun readings.On readings are almost always used when the kanji appears as part of a compound word.In the vast majority of cases, there is only one correct reading for a kanji in a given context. That is to say, most compound words are spoken aloud in only one way, as are most solitary characters.If a kanji has multiple On readings, then there is no way to know which On reading to use for it in a compound word except to simply learn by trial and error as other people correct you, or to look up every new word you find to see how it is pronounced. Unless there are furigana.There are a series of different On readings called go-on, too-on, and so on (you know what I'm talking about better than I do), and many Kanji have a different reading for each one, and all are used in different contexts, and a learner must memorize all of them for most Kanji.If anyone could contradict/confirm the above seven statements, it would probably be very helpful. Please refer to them by number so we know exactly what we're talking about. I am hoping to God someone contradicts number 7.
I have another sentence from 合格できる、日本語能力試験N２:そこで私はいつも考えるのだが、各国にある日本大使館は日本人旅行者のため、こういう留学生、研究家を講師にした講座を現地で開いてくれないだろうか。The part in the sentence where it says 「講師にした講座」 is hard for me to understand.

In my audio learning, I hear the beginning consonant sound of the same word spoken by two different speakers to be as a "w", as in "wari", or to be an "m", as in "mari".

What simple rule can I apply to sort out this sound when I hear it

I've always wondered why「ん」is the only kana without having a vowel sound attached to it.

Sometimes it is the case that fake or example names will be used in place of actual names for purposes of explaining something. For example:田中さんの主張には、その点において疑問があります。I have a question about one of Mr. Tanaka's points.As a name, "Tanaka" is not so important, it is just a filler in this case. I noticed that sometimes instead of a name, letters can be used like A, B, C.. Aさんの主張には、その点において疑問があります。I have a question about one of Mr. A's points.However, is it appropriate in Japanese to use "Aさん" here especially if "Bさん" doesn't exist When is it appropriate to use an actual name like "田中さん" or a letter "Aさん" Or is there not any distinction made in JapaneseEDIT: What context best suits these naming conventions Can "A,B,C" be used in the context of literature or is it only limited to Mathematics In the example above why might "Tanaka" be a better fit compared to "A,B,C"

In my textbook 「日本語総まとめN２」, they list the two vocabulary words 「余計に」 and 「余分に」. I am almost unable to differentiate between their appropriate usage. Here are the example sentences from the book:他人より余計に勉強する - "study more than others"いつもより余分に食事を作る - "cook more than usual"I looked up the definitions for 余分 and 余計. However, even the entry for 余分 lists 余計 as a definition.I asked a friend who is a native whether the first example sentence could be replaced with 「余分」instead of「余計」. She mentioned that it could, but she was not able to tell me the reason. She also was unsure of the difference between them.When should either of these words be used and what are the differences between them
In introductory physics books, when they introduce 弱い相互作用 "weak interaction" and 強い相互作用 "strong interaction", I almost always see a notification that these terms are supposed to be the name of the specific forces and should not be taken to mean just an adjective modifying a noun in an ordinary way. Are these terms really unnatural as the name of specific things much as to require such notes, and why is it What natural (unexisting) alternatives would be possible Is the unnaturalness any stronger than the unnaturalness of the corresponding English terms in English
Some words are written with katakana, but also have kanji. For example:コーヒー　珈琲ページ　頁How did this happen They are loanwords, but no doubt had Japanese equivalents before these variants were imported. Is that the case And are these original words now forgotten
I've worked my current job for a few years, and I can't believe I've never thought of this question.  I have a unique employment situation.  I am employed by a university, but the work I do is for the state government; that is, nothing about the work I do/produce has any relation to the university.  It's simply that our office is on the university campus and the university signs my paycheck.So what's the best way to describe my situation  I always learned that 〜に勤めている means "to be employed at/by 〜", but some dictionaries say "work (in, at, for)" which confuses me because I work at the university but for the government.Would something like 大学に勤めている[州政]{しゅうせい}職員 suffice  Or is there a better way to phrase it(Note: I made up 州政 since America has states, but presumably it would work along the lines of 府政, 県政, 国政, 市政, etc., but maybe 州立政府 or something would be more correct.)
I came across this phrase today:むぎゅむぎゅFrom context, it looks like it should mean something like "cute" or "poor you", but I couldn't find it on jisho.org or goo.ne.jp.Is there a Japanese equivalent of urbandictionary, somewhere I can look when standard dictionaries failThanks!Edit: Removed mention of かわいそう, as it was a distraction from the question.
In a shrine graffito written in 1559, two carpenters complain:其時座主ハ大キナコスデオチヤリテ一度モ焼酎ヲ不被下候  'At that time, the high priest (stingy bugger!) gave us not even a drop of shochu to drink.' The form of the main verb 不被下候 includes 不 (negation) and 被 (passivisation), followed by the verb with そうろう. Thus, くだされずそうろう "(we) were not given". The order of the morphemes as is pronounced is inverted from the order as is written.Meanwhile, a shochu manufacturer has a product 不被下候 in reference to this legendary act. They give the readingくださらずそうろう.When was it common to write in this mannerIn what other ways was Japanese verbal morphology mapped onto kanji in this wayWhich of the readings くださらずそうろう and くだされずそうろう is correct
While looking up マイカー in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_gairaigo_and_wasei-eigo_terms, I came across マイ・ワイフ. Is マイ・ワイフ used in real life, or mainly in animeIf the former, what differences does it have to other words for "wife"
I've watched a few anime and keep coming across a word that sounds like "henki". In the subtitles, the sentences are like "Are you ok", "How are you feeling". With those translations, I'd expect the word to be "genki". I didn't know if maybe in some dialects the "g" could be pronounced as a "h". So am I crazy or am I onto something
According to The sounds of Japanese (Vance 2008):When /ɾ/ is the first phoneme in an utterance, the tip of the tongue is already resting lightly on the alveolar ridge, and /ɾ/ is produced by rapidly releasing this contact. Strictly speaking this utterance-initial allophone isn't a tap.Can anyone elaborate on this utterance initial [ɾ] and its allophonic derivation, perhaps giving a reference for further reading If it isn't a tap, then what is it It sounds like it might be a voiced plosive, but it doesn't feel similar to either alveolar plosives [t, d]. It certainly sounds like there is an r-quality to it, but I wouldn't know how a plosive might acquire an r-quality.Are you actually realizing, and furthermore aware of, an allophonic variant of [ɾ] (specifically the apparent utterance-initial allophone)
In this answer, the kanji 妾 was defined as "mistress".I'm not so familiar with this kanji, so I looked it up, and it seems to have about four readings and two definitions. Although I think some of these readings might be archaic, there's めかけ, そばめ, and おんなめ which all mean "mistress" or "kept woman".But then there's also the reading わらわ which seems to be a humble feminine form of saying "I" or "me", similar to あたし.Most of the examples I saw, were related to the "mistress" meaning, so I wondered:Is the feminine "I" meaning still in use If so, when would it be used Given the other definition, it seems like that would be a very unpopular way for a woman to refer to herself...Also, with regards to the "mistress" meaning, which of the readings are still in use
When I come across the titles キャリアウーマン, OL, and ビジネスウーマン, I seem to have a difficult time picturing what their position is or what they do. I'm wondering if anyone can elaborate on how they are different.Also, I know that there is a male counterpart to these, but are they the same in title and position I know that there are ビジネスマン and サラリーマン, but are these different as well
What is the difference between 詰まらない and 詰らない Are they both valid words Are they pronounced the same and do they have the same meaning
The wikipedia article on jinmeiyō kanji states:Before September 27, 2004, there were 2232 government-designated  jinmeiyō kanji used in personal and geographical names, with plans to  increase this list by 578 kanji in the near future. This was the  largest increase since World War II. The plan had not been without  controversy, however. For example, the Chinese characters for  "cancer", "hemorrhoids", "corpse" and "excrement", as well as parts of  compound words (words created from two or more Chinese characters)  meaning "curse", "prostitute", and "rape", are among the proposed  additions to the list. This is because no measures were taken to  determine the appropriateness of the kanji proposed, with the  committee deciding that parents could make such decisions themselves.  However, the government will seek input from the public before  approving the list. My first assumption was that maybe a kanji had more than one meaning, one which was bad, and one that wasn't, but that doesn't seem to be the case: looking up 癌  in jisho.org only gave cancer, and cancer related terminology.The article goes on to say:Some of these kanji have led to speculation that  the "odd" kanji being added to the names list are being done so in an  attempt to make a de-facto expansion of the Jōyō Kanji List, rather  than with the serious idea that anyone will use them in names.And alsoMany others were included not for their potential uses in names (as is  noted), but rather because of their frequent use and are easy to read  and write.But why would the Japanese government do a de-facto expansion of the Jōyō Kanji List, rather than just modify the actual Jōyō Kanji List
Is it possible to use 好き, and specify who is fond of it風呂は好きです。Would be interpreted as "[I am] fond of baths.", and 風呂は好きですかWould be interpreted as "Are [you] fond of baths".How would I specify that it was someone else who was fond of something, if that's possible
I had asked my friend what uses of 「ご無沙汰」exist and the situations people use them in. Among others, she had remarked that it could mean something along the lines of "not having sexual intercourse for a long time". Is this really the caseIf so, who uses it and in what way I have tried to find some source explaining this, but haven't as of yet.
I used to call black people くろじん, either because I mistakenly read 黒人{こくじん} as such or because I heard it somewhere (or both), until I was told by another Japanese learner that こくじん is more politically correct.Looking into it, I can't find the word in the dictionary.I actually used くろじん for a while and was never corrected on it. I learned こくじん by asking what it meant, after someone said it.Is this all my mistake, or is it actually a word If so, is it derogatory
When I see something like this:ﾍ(´∀｀ﾍ)ﾍ(´∀｀ﾍ)ﾖｲﾖｲ(ﾉ´∀｀)ﾉ(ﾉ´∀｀)ﾉﾖｲﾖｲ♪I think some voodoo demon wants to say something to me. o_OMy Japanese friends often use kaomoji.  But, when they add (´▽｀) or (ﾟ∀ﾟ) I can't tell if they are sad, confused, happy, or even angry.  I just can't see the emotion for an upside-down A.Maybe you can draw something based on the most popular kaomoji, so I can envision it in my mind like you do.I'm afraid of those demon smilies! Please help me understand how to interpret kaomoji.
I've just started, and everything says learn your hiragana and katakana first.The hiragana, very clear. I guess you can say an awful lot of things in Japanese with hiragana. But everything I've been reading all seems to say that katakana are mostly used to form loanwords from other languages. I don't see how a beginner would need to use loan words early on.So what is the importance of the katakana I have absolutely no doubt I'm badly underestimating them.
I was looking at a chart of hiragana and trying to find the characters to form the name of a song Inochi no Namae. I started with i, then no, but there's no chi. I then started wondering where chu and cho are, among others. I'm guessing it has to do with the diacritic marks. Then I got "na," and the "mae" threw me.Any help appreciated.
ネガティブ is an adjective that's based on the word "negative" (or maybe a word from another European language). But when describing a person, does it mean "negative", as in pessimistic, always complaining, or does it mean "bad" in generalApparently, in the news recently was a case where a school exam had 「学校でもっともネガティブな先生は？」and listed one of the teachers in the example answer.Saying "Who is the worst teacher" would make sense, but "Who is the most negative teacher" doesn't really make sense. Complaining about someone complaining seems a little odd, though maybe that's just me.
I'm working on some example questions from my grammar textbook. One of them I listed below:　税金はこの表（　　）計算されています。　ア）につれて　イ）に応じて　ウ）に比べて　エ）に基づいてI'm unsure why 「に基づいて」is the only correct answer. What is the reason that 「に応じて」is inappropriate
Consider the following:に here is used in its function of denoting the time where an event occurs (に1):◯　一時に1◯　一時半に1◯　月曜日に1◯　正月に1*　昨日に1/◯　昨日には*　今日に1/◯　今日には*　明日に1/◯　明日には*　去年に1/◯　去年には*　今年に1/◯　今年には*　来年に1/◯　来年には*　最近に1に becomes acceptable if dative(に2):◯　最近に2なってWhy is it that に may not be used for the instances marked with * Why is には acceptable If に1 is prohibited but には allowed, does this suggest that the に of には is distinct from に1I think に1 may not be used to mark deictic (words which meaning depends on contextual information) nouns. I think that is what they have in common. It is not possible to have useful information about "yesterday", "today", "tomorrow" or "next year" etc. unless we have more information about the current time.
João is a Portuguese name which has a peculiar pronunciation that is very difficult for foreign people. It is the Portuguese equivalent to the English John, but the pronunciations are very different. If you see that Wikipedia page, it might help get a grasp of the correct pronunciation. However, I have no idea how this name would be represented in kana...Does anyone know what might be the correct kana for this name
In the textbook Japanese for Busy People I, the order of the elements in a sentence is always the same (subject - when - with whom - by what means - to where - verb) at least as far as I have made it. Like so:スミスさんは　あした　かいしゃの　ひとと　おおさかししゃに　いきます。スミスさんは　きのう　ひとりで　おおさかししゃに　いきました。スミスさんは　きんようびに　チャンさんと　しんかんせんで　おおさかに　いきました。Is this order always the same in the Japanese language or is it is a specificity of my textbook in order to better synthesize each element that composes the sentenceFrom what I understand, the first sentence could be translated into English with variations in the order of the elements:Mr. Smith is going to the Osaka branch office with a colleague  tomorrow.Tomorrow, Mr. Smith is going to the Osaka branch office with a  colleague.Mr. Smith is going with a colleague to the Osaka branch office  tomorrow.Can these variations occur in Japanese as well Or does the sentence have to have the order displayed abovePlease reply in kana, as I do not know any kanji.
What is the etymology of the word プラスアルファ(+α)This is a neologism I believe, however I hear it quite often nowadays. I'm curious to what the origin would be
I suspect「根も葉も火種も」 is an allusion to something I do not recognize. To what does it refer Consider this couplet from an amusing song released in March by IOSYS called 「ステマの女」(CD and promotional Flash animation, that can be found on YouTube or NND): ウワサは揺らめく 霧の中  根も葉も火種も ありゃしない根も葉もない is an idiom that means "unfounded rumor".How did it come to have this meaning from 根 and 葉 What does the addition of 火種 and the change from ない to ありゃしない do to the idiom
Pretty sure you have to use 割 but I don't know which pronunciation to use and how to say "equals" in this context.

I know it's used for greetings in a restaurant or store. But what type of verb conjugation (ex: polite, plain, honorific, imperative, or something else) is it Is it used with other verbs Is it archaic Japanese or modern Japanese
In the following saying:時は金なり。What exactly is なり My dictionaries seem to give a number of different options that could all explain its use here.Is it 成る Is it 也, an archaic version of です or ある If so, does that mean that in the past, Japanese verbs did not all end in the う-sound
Is いらっしゃいませ only used by staff, or is it used in other circumstancesWhen I was at a dinner at a restaurant being held after a programmers' meetup, I thought that I heard it being used by one of the people eating (it could have been the organizer of the dinner for all I know) to welcome a late-comer. Or is it more likely I mis-heard them merely saying いらっしゃい or some other form of the verb
I read electronics/computing articles, and I find an incredible amount of terms are written either in kanji (almost similar to Chinese) or katakana. There are times when it's confusing as to know why. For example:フラッシュストレージメディアタブレットバックアップOn the other hand there are:記憶容量不揮発性半導体メモリ仮想アドレス空間What interests me is the mix of katakana and kanji in these last terms. Is there any reason for this Why not just stick with one method I'm sure there is a way to describe アドレス in kanji for the last term. Does mixing them make it easier to understand It seems like the more recent / well-understood terms by the general public get katakana. The others have kanji bases. EDIT: There is 不揮発性半導体記憶装置 but would 「不揮発性半導体記憶」 not carry the same meaning as 不揮発性半導体メモリ？ It just seems to be a random decision whether a word gets katakana or kanji.
In their comment to an answer on the question "Are foreign personal names usually written in katakana rather than Romaji", user sawa says:... Chinese names should be written in kanji rather than katakana and read by the Japanese pronunciation. For example, 金大中 is キムデジュン, not きんだいちゅう, but 毛沢東 is もうたくとう, not マオジードン. ...This got me wondering, since each Japanese character generally has at least two readings is there always one clear reading for pronouncing such namesI expect of course that the "on" readings would be used, but often there is more than one on reading for the same character.From the comments so far (no answers yet) this is indeed very interesting, and on Zhen Lin's prompting I would like to include Korean names as well despite their being discounted in the older linked question.
I've been seeing やつ used for "thing" reasonably frequently in Manga/online etc, for example:ほとんどは本とか食玩とか細かいやつかな。"It's virtually all stuff like books, those small toys sold with food and small things I suppose."富士を目指しましょう。地方富士というやつよ。"Let's set our sights on Fuji. The thing that's called 'the local Fuji.'"「正直がいちばん」というやつだ。"Honesty is the best policy"But what kind of a nuance does やつ have and when can it be used compared with 物 and こと (I'm guessing it might be colloquial, sometimes joking, and possibly sometimes derogatory but I'm not really sure).Is there any way to translate this usage of やつ into English without losing too much of the original nuance
I want to write an essay with the title “Difference between Hard Work and Smart Work”.By “hard work”, I mean continuing the work with old ideas without thinking up new ideas, and working all the time to solve a problem.By “smart work”, I mean innovating new ideas and trying to solve a problem within a short period of time.Would 「重労働とスマートな仕事の相違点」 be the correct way to express this in Japanese

Here are two examples:[電話]{でんわ}による[通報]{つうほう} // Fine電話により通報する // OkayI feel like using により is strange in my second example, but I'm not sure. Is the second example perfectly fine grammatically I feel like 電話で通報 or 電話から通報 would be better.
I have read the sentence    "12歳の小児の知力しかない".    In this sentence , I would like to know the usage of   知力  .In dictionary , it means "intelligence "Can I use 知恵 or 知能 instead of  知力.Is there any difference in usage between them.  With Regards,
Could someone please explain why someone would use hiragana instead of the regular kanjiFor instance, we have a character for nagai - 長い, but examples using ながい can also be found in dictionaries and on the internet. Is the hiragana used for emphasis, or is it just the author's tasteExample (Tanaka Corpus):このながい不況の結果、社会不安が起こるかもしれない。Social unrest may come about as a result of this long recession.Another example found: おさない instead of 幼い子供はおさないときに母をしゃぶり、大きくなって父親をしゃぶる。
I was told that the following uses of と and な after 色々 were the same.彼女のために色々と甘いものを買ってきた。I bought a bunch of sweets and brought them to my GF.  彼女のために色々な甘いものを買ってきた。If this is true, is this an added use of the generic particle と that is not listed in this definitionとparticle / conjunction :if;  whenこのシャンプーを買うと素敵なヘアブラシがついてきます。This shampoo comes with a nice hair brush.  彼女は、どうしてそんなことが可能なのかと尋ねている。She's asking how that's possible. ▾and１２と２４と７と１１の合計は５４です。The sum of 12, 24, 7 and 11 is 54.  いまやろうと思ったのに。I was just about to get started any-how. ▾with私はあなたとお話してよかった。I have enjoyed talking to you.  彼女は今忙しいので、あなたとお話できません。She is busy at present and can't speak to you. ▾particle used for quoting (with speech, thoughts, etc.)「美しい」とか「醜い」といった言葉は相対的な用語である。The words 'beautiful' and 'ugly' are relative terms.  そういう相手の前では、私の見せ掛けだけの怜悧な技術は、見抜かれた時に負けていたと思う。I think that against somebody like that, my seemingly clever techniques would be seen through and then I would be defeated. ▾How does the と in the first quote work
As we know, there is a class of adjectives that end in 〜らか:  滑【なめ】らか, 明【あき】らか, 清【きよ】らか, 安【やす】らか, etc.やわらか (柔らか or 軟らか) is also in this class of adjectives.  However, it can also be written as the イ-adjective やわらかい.  So when and how did this adjective pick up an い to become a separate イ-adjectiveCan this be done arbitrarily with any of the 〜らか class adjectives  Like 滑【なめ】らかい, 明【あき】らかい, 清【きよ】らかい, 安【やす】らかい.  My gut feeling is that it cannot, but only because those forms sound strange to me.  If it cannot arbitrarily be done, are there any other 〜らか class adjectives that can take on the extra い
What is the difference between 気{き}をつけて, お大事{だいじ}に and お元気{げんき}で.How and in which context(s) are they used
Here in Kansai I hear せや, せやねん, and せやな everywhere. I was wondering if anyone could clarify the meaning and usage of these, as well as their equivalent in more standard Japanese Additionally, are there any other variations based on せや that are used commonly
A father is talking to his kid about their plans tomorrow and says,けんしんくん、お父さんと一緒に買いに行きましょうか？Why not: けんしんくん、お父さんと買いに行きましょうか？(The sentence is supposed to say, "Kenshin, would you like to go to shopping with dad" Obviously, not a one-to-one translation)Aren't both sentences the same I can't see the second sentence not relaying the idea of "together". So what does the 一緒に do exactly It seems, to me, that the sentence doesn't really need it.
Consider the following:A, B and C came:AとBとCが来たAやBやCが来たAにBにCが来たWhat do I need to consider when deciding which of the three (と, や, に) to useI think a large portion is determined by the type of verb used. I shall generalise into two groups:Reciprocal type - marry; meet; be similarNon-reciprocal type - see; walk; be interestingAmbiguity may result from using listing particles with reciprocal type verbs:AとBが結婚した (Ambiguous)A and B got married (to each other)A and B got married (independent instances) AやBが結婚した (Not ambiguous)A and B got married (independent instances among others (example-giving nuance of や))But for these cases: AにBが結婚したAにBが会ったCan they receive listing interpretation similar to AにBにCが来たWill に be forced to be dativeHow about when the sentence is rearranged to:BがAに結婚したBがAに会ったCan this receive a listing interpretationWill に be forced to be dative
I was on the phone with NTT the other day and things were going well (or as good as they could), until I had to spell some email address for the customer rep, and fell upon the letter 'Z'.Instinctively, I went with 'zed' as a pronunciation, which seemed to stumble the NTT lady, so I tried a 'zee', which did not seem to elicit more comprehension...Eventually, after trying a few more variations, I had to give up and was told to send that piece of info by email (a rather silly situation, considering I had just been giving and receiving bits of information in Japanese for 15 minutes until that point).According to Wikipedia, pretty much any pronunciation goes:Z; Zetto, zeddo, or zī (ゼット, ゼッド, or ズィー, though sometimes pronounced jī, ジー)It is very possible that, while trying to figure which of the two common native pronunciations to use, I omitted to stress the second mora enough (saying 'zed' instead of a frank 'zeddo' or 'zetto'). But I'm still a bit surprised that she would stumble on this particular instance.In your experience, is there a more common/natural pronunciation of the letter 'Z' in Japanese Any circumstances that might dictate the choice of either
the definition for 一体【いったい】:Adverb :  ...the heck (e.g. "what the heck");  ...in the world (e.g. "why in the world");  ...on earth (e.g. "who on earth"); —Before an interrogative, forms an emphatic question.  一体どこで彼に会ったんだ。Where on earth did you meet him  いったいなぜ彼を駅に連れて行ったの？Why on earth did you take him to the station Noun :  one object;  one body;  unityone form;  one style  one Buddhist image (or carving, etc.)Adverbial noun :generally;  in general;  → 一体にGiven the definition of the noun, why does this word possess an implied incredulity when used before an interrogative
Or "I understand much better now." If someone helped me with a translation and I responded with: どうもありがとうございます。前より上手に分かっています。 Would that be the correct way to express that in Japanese
I usually see the 投入{とうにゅう} on labels on ATM or train station gate. Is this kanji applicable to all flat input devices, or does it also include coin slot I can only infer this means some sort of input because of the kanji 入. When I search this in the dictionary, it states investment or circuit. How do you define this word in general I also see 投入場, which seems to me to be describe receiving area.
It looks like にわたって has just one meaning, "over (a period of time)" whereas にかけて means "over (a period of time)" and also "until". Is that correct Can they be used almost interchangeably
As expected, the adverbial form (aka 連用形) of an i-adjective ...く can be used as an intensifying adverb to an adjectival predicate:すごく速い    But there are cases where the indicative non-past affirmative form (or attributive form, depending on the theoretical assumption) ...い is used in addition to or replacing the adverbial form:Young people's colloquial speech:すごい速いKansai dialect:えらいきつい性格Modern literature:恐ろしい沢山書いた　 (夏目漱石)  恐ろしい長い物を捲り上げる　 (樋口一葉)  恐しい利く唐辛子だ　 (泉鏡花)  可恐い光るのね、金剛石　 (尾崎紅葉)    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(饮水思源 - 主题文章阅读: 形容詞の副詞化)What is happening with this usage of i-adjectives
The first level of Japan's political division is called "prefecture" in English. However, in Japanese, there are four words for it: 都, 道, 府, and 県, and depending the particular prefecture, a certain one is used. Most use 県. Why is it complicated like this Why couldn't all be called 県 Some subquestions include (but are not limited to):Tokyo prefecture was changed from 東京府 to 東京都 when its political system was changed. Why couldn't the political system be changed without changing the name If there were needs to exclusively mention Tokyo prefecture in some law, why couldn't the term 東京府 be used instead of 東京都府 seems to have been used for prefectures that typically have been the political center of Japan (related to the Emperor). But does this naming have any political significance within the political system effective now Is there any political law that mentions something particular that applies to 府 And if 府 were indeed prefectures with special political status, then why weren't 京都府 and 大阪府 downgraded to 京都県 and 大阪県 when the exclusive prestigious political status was given to then 東京府, renaming it to 東京都Does 道 have any political significance Why couldn't 北海道 be 北海県  It is true that 北海道 has peculiar issues, and there used to be things like 北海道開発庁, but 沖縄県 also has peculiar political issues, and there is no problem with it being called 県 instead of some other thing.Isn't 京都府 a strange word If it is a 府, then it should be 京府; if it is a 都, then it should be nothing more than 京都. Similarly, isn't 京都市 a strange word why is it not 京市Is there any other country whose word for the first political division is as complicated as this
It seems strange to me that 負{ま}けず嫌{ぎら}い means "hate losing" and not "hate not losing". (食わず嫌い for example seems to mean "hate a food without trying it".)Providing credible sources if possible, what is the etymology of 負けず嫌い Is there any difference in meaning or strength between 負け嫌い and 負けず嫌い
There's a common abbreviation system in dictionaries and I'm wondering how they're read and used.Here's an example:I'm guessing it has something to do with how to fill in the blanks in the example sentences, but hoping you can save me the detective work.
What is the etymology of the word バレる, and why is it often written with katakanaばれる(P); バレる (v1,vi) to leak out (a secret); to be exposed (a lie, improper behaviour, etc.) (behavior)その秘密はついにばれた。 The secret came to light at last.
I'm trying to understand if there is a difference between the two words 直感 and 直観. After looking both words up in a dictionary, the entries both list "intuition / intuitive". I also tried looking up the words in a Japanese dictionary, but I was unable to see a notable difference. What are the correct ways to use these wordsCould this sentence be replaced with 直感的？：情報化が進んだ社会の若者は、かつての若者以上に、希望の実現が困難であることを直観的に知っているように思います。
My organization XYZ has been mentioned in a newspaper, and I would like to post a link to the online article, together with a short explanation like "XYZ mentioned in newspaper ABC!"How about 日本経済新聞にXYZ記載！ or 日本経済新聞にXYZの名が出る！What is the most natural way to say thisI don't want to appear excessively boastful either.
The four of ちゃんと, きちんと, きっちり and ぴったり all seem to mean something like "perfectly", "precisely" or "exactly", and there seems to be a lot of similarity between their definitions.Daijisen says that all three of ちゃんと, きちんと and きっちり can mean something like "without disorder and well arranged" and きっちり and ぴったり "without deviation", but I think they're used in different ways.I think just from the way I've seen them used that ちゃんと might often, though not always, be close to "(do something) the way you're supposed/expected to", きちんとした "spotless", きちんと "to the letter", きっちり "firmly" and ぴったり "(suits) perfectly"/"perfect (match for)", but I'm not really confident and I don't have sources to back it up.What is the difference between them and how do their usages differ
This question may be related to What does で分かる mean (Cf. Tsuyoshi Ito and my comments to my answer).(Regular) verbs can be turned into the potential form by attaching -((ra)r)e-:tabe-ru vs. tabe-(ra)re-ru  kak-u vs. kak-e-ruHowever, the verb 分かる cannot. Why is thatwakar-u  * wakar-e-ruThe verb 理解する, which has a same/similar meaning, can have the potential form. Suru verbs are known to be irregular and require -deki-, and 理解する does as well:suru vs. dekiru  benkyou-suru vs. benkyou-dekiru  rikai-suru vs. rikai-dekiru    知る also does not seem to allow the potential form.sir-u  * sir-e-ru (Okay under the spontaneous or the passive interpretations of -((ra)r)e-, but not under the potential interpretation).But for 知る, you can have a lengthier expression to turn it into a potential form. Nevertheless, 分かる even resist this form:知ることができる  理解することができる  * 分かることができるThis seems to be indicating that the problem is not morphological or phonological (for example along the lines of crash with homonymous/homophoneme expressions that Flaw suggests).
I have a hard time understanding the use of でわかる. I'm guessing that it doesn't just simply mean that "something is understood". Instead I wonder if it means that "something was realized" I read the following sentence:京都大学大学院薬学研究科の男性教授が、新薬の研究開発に絡む物品購入などで不正な会計処理をしていた疑いがあることが大学関係者の話で分かった。Would it be correct to say that "this situation was realized due to the person's story"
I'm just curious at the appearance of 「口」 that makes this word mean "population". Why should it be 「口」 as opposed to any other body part or anything else Is there a definitive reason or story associated with this word　If 「口」 is used as a counter then why couldn't 「個」 replace it If I'm not mistaken doesn't 「個」 refer to individuals more so than 「口」
水商売 【みずしょうばい】 (n) (1) chancy trade (business) with a high turnover rate and uncertain profitability; (2) the entertainment, eating, and drinking business; (3) the night entertainment (nightlife) businessThe implied meanings behind the use of 水 in 水商売 seems varied and colorful. Would anyone care to explain the usage I take it that 水 here both refers to liquor as well as the "flow" of the trade and the risk (such as the risk from wet weather) that comes with these types of businesses. Is the diverse set of meanings in 水 here used in other compound words or expressions
This is from the second episode of Noir. The two women are sitting quietly eating dinner. One of the women says to the other:ちょっとは美味しそうに食べたらどう？ For the life of me, I can't parse this sentence into something understandable in English. Here are my issues:How is ちょっと the topic (or is it subject) of the sentence What is its meaning here食べたら from what I know is "When you eat", but I don't know how to quite translate it with 美味しそうに.The whole phrase is in front of どう so it is some type of relative or dependent clause. So is the beginning of that sentence, "How about (that) when you eat ...." This is my guess. I'm not sure if I'm correct though.

I meant to gather more examples before posting this question, but here we go. These are some lines out of various Ghibli movies I saw last weekend.わからないは - when asked to take a guess about somethingいないは - after looking for someone in a specific placeI realize this is casual and may not be strictly grammatically correct. Still I wonder what's the reasoning behind these type of sentences. It's not difficult to understand what they mean, but why は How would a native speaker justify the particle And if someone can tie it to some formally correct version of the sentences that would be great!

The following was observed in sawa's answer to "Can ごとに be replaced by それぞれ in this question":　◯　正月はそれぞれの家が門松を立てる。　×　木村さんはそれぞれの会う人に挨拶している。　◯　木村さんは会う人それぞれに挨拶している。それぞれの会う人 is said to be an ungrammatical construction because it is modified from outside of the relative clause. What are the rules for modifying noun-phrasesI had perceived それぞれの会う人 as a XのY construction i.e. I perceived 会う人 as a noun-equivalent. Does this imply that a relative clause construction cannot act in all ways that a noun canAlso, are the following constructions valid[な-adjective] + [noun-phrase from relative clause construction][い-adjective] + [noun-phrase from relative clause construction]
正月は家ごとに門松を立てる。For example, could I say正月はそれぞれの家に門松をたてる。If so, the meaning remains the same, or are there any subtle nuances that comes with each word It seems to me, whenever i see sentences with either words, that sometimes they can be interchangeable and sometimes it just seems weird replacing one with the another. More specifically, some sentences with ごとに could be rewritten using the pattern それぞれの (which in this case acts as a pronoun), for example:木村さんは会う人ごとに挨拶している。 -&gt; 木村さんはそれぞれの会う人に挨拶している。Is the second sentence above by any chance correct
According to the WWWJDIC, the verbal suffix まい can mean:(1) probably isn't (doesn't, won't, etc.)  (2) don't (doesn't) intend to; intend not to  (3) must not; (when used in an imperative sentence) don'tbut I've found this sentence in my 日本語能力試験文法問題対策一級 text: 何であれ, 必要ならば買わなければなる まい 。Which is the right translation Or are there other possible translationsa) 'No matter what, if it's necessary, I'll probably have to buy it.'  b) 'No matter what, if it's necessary, I won't probably have to buy it.' If it's b), it doesn't make much sense, does it If it's a), it contradicts the meaning given by the dictionary.
I have learned (意味) and (意義）as "meaning". I am confused these two words. Are they same or is there any difference in usage
There are situations where transitives and intransitives are switched without any clear reason. For example, a transitive verb is usually used to describe a situation like this:タクシーが街を流す    rather than the logically more reasonable intransitive version:タクシーが街を流れるI am not particularly discussing the availability of the latter, and to compare the frequency of these forms is totally irrelevant to my question, but suppose you want to do an estimate. I know of a search engine called Google, which, at this moment, returns 35 hits for the string for the illogical "タクシーが流す", most of which are the relevant phrases, and 14 hits for the string for the logical "タクシーが流れる", of which 7 are the relevant phrases (excluding this very question), so that indicates that the illogical form is used almost five times the logical form (keeping aside the hits made by another "Google" that I am not aware of, which returns 16,700 results for the illogical "タクシーが流す" and 507,000 results for the logical "タクシーが流れる", leading to the opposite conclusion, according to a user of this site).Outside of this peculiar usage, the transitive 流す requires an animate and volitional agent as the subject, which is distinct from the theme that is the object, and cannot be used reflexively.* そうめんが流す  店員がそうめんを流す  そうめんが流れる    * 気球が空を流す  冒険家のチームが気球を空に流す  気球が空を流れる* ニュースが電光掲示板を流す  ディレクターがニュースを電光掲示板に流す  ニュースが電光掲示板を流れるSimilarly, in stock exchange contexts, transitive verbs are used instead of their intransitive counterpart:株が高値をつける  株に高値がつく株が引ける  株が引くOn the contrary, when directions are given in cooking, intransitives are used instead of the more logically appropriate transitives:酒とみりんが入ります  酒とみりんを入れますOutside of this peculiar context, the intransitive 入る either 1) requires an animate volitional agent 2) or the sentence has to describe the potential/ability rather than a single event.* 日曜日の晩に辞書がかばんに入ります  日曜日の晩に私が辞書をかばんに入れます  この小さな辞書はかばんに入るけど、この大きいのは入りませんWhy do these switching happen
What does it mean to put a な after an い-adjective For example, many Youtube videos are called begin "いいなCM", and a Japanese text book I have uses this sentence as an example:この通りを行くと 大きな 交差点がある。Go along this street, and you will find a large crossroads.What is the meaning of this な It is also unusual that the 大きい is missing the final い but the いいな is not. I cannot find it in my textbook or on using Google.

I'm learning vocabulary from 日本語総まとめN2. In one section they describe four words and group them together (I assume because they have slightly different meanings but somewhat similar). They group them with an example as follows:今に　：　そんなことをしていると、今に後悔しますよ。今にも：　今にも雨が降りそうだ。今更　：　今さらできないといわれても困る。未だに：　未だにその事件は解決していない。I was wondering why 「未」 is used. Why not 「今」 Possibly I'm misunderstanding why this kanji is used because I don't know any other words with 「未」 that hold the pronunciation 「いま」.

Consider the extracted original Japanese text from the translation attempt in "Why is 知りません the negative form of　知っています？" :これは「知る」という動詞の"意味特徴"と、私たちが「知る」に抱く"イメージ=認知の在り方"に原因があると考えるのが妥当だと思う｡Also consider this proposed translation:"Regarding this fact, I think it is appropriate to think that it is due to the 'semantic features' of the verb '知る' and the image (= the way we perceive) that we have against '知る'.Isn't "the way we ～" for する-nouns expressed using ～の仕方 How is it different from ～の在り方 Can the same difference be reflected in other verbs  I.e. if for する-nouns there is a "pair" like 認知の在り方/認知の仕方 then is there a similar "pair" concept for verbs like 書く If 書き方 is analogous to ～仕方, what form of 書く is analogous to ～在り方 What is ～在り方 used for

Wikipedia (Japanese Verb Conjugation):Negatives [verb negative-conjugations] are not normally made into causatives. Instead, a negative ending is added to the causative of the verb.

I have this sentence as an example for the grammar point をもって:I国が起こした戦争は、世界中に衝撃をもって伝えられた。をもって　can either refer to [1] the means through which something is done, or [2] a point in time where something ends/begins. I'm not really sure which usage this is. As far as I can figure out, it's either something like [1] "The world found out about the war in Country X with a shock/suddenly", or [2] "When the war broke out suddenly (with a crash/bang) in Country X, the world found out about it."Or, more likely, none of the above. Can someone shed some light on what I'm missing
I'm wondering what the reason for the mispronunciation of 円 in English came to be "yen". I can understand how some words like 東京 became "Tokyo", but "en" to "yen" seems strange. On a side note, why is this symbol 「￥」 used to denote currency And would you pronounce that the same as 円 as well

I was helping to translate this passage on the website Lang-8.com:Lang-8をやって良かった点は、どんな間違いをしても恥をかかないようになったという点と、ネイティブの人でも英語を話すときに同じような間違いをするんだということに気付いた点です。The great point about having used Lang-8 is that I don't have to feel ashamed about whatever mistakes I make, and I've realized that native English speakers make the same kind of mistakes when they speak english.I am a little confused as to how だということ is being used in the quoted sentence. The writer said that I could equate it to "that." While I get that much, should I disregard or stifle an urge to relate the いう to these verbs: 言う; 云う; 謂う Can anyone give an explantation as to how it is being used here If I translate it literally and get "the thing/point that is said," is that incorrect (I understand that this meaning is superfluous to the sentence)
I'd like to know if there is a phrase similar to the English phrase of "running around". To explain more clearly, it should mean to be able to go out freely and do whatever one like's without being restricted.For example:If you're going to own a dog, they need some space to run around and exercise.Have you been running around with those hooligans againMy wife makes me run around downtown doing all her errands.It doesn't necessarily mean "to run" all the time though it may. Just wondering if there is any phrase that resembles this. The only thing I can think of is 遊び回る and that may only apply to children, games, and such.
So Sawa in another thread says that こと cannot be used in the example below.

Recently, I wanted to express the sentence "Maybe they'd make good pets." in Japanese. I initially tried to say it as such:[多分]{たぶん}いいペットでしょうね！I was then corrected by a native speaker, and he told me that it would sound more natural if I expressed it this way:[多分]{たぶん}いいペットになるでしょうね！ Now, what exactly does this add to the sentence I believe that in this case, なる is being used to mean "to become" (It's hard to tell for sure since I don't have a kanji for reference.) Was it added simply to make the expression more idiomatic, or is there a more grammatical reason behind it

According to an answer to this question, the word [一杯]{いっぱい} can be used to expess fullness; especially in relation to the capacity of whatever is containing the quantity. This, however, tends to sound like whatever is being held must be physical (e.g. have matter and volume), and be countable. Can [一杯]{いっぱい} be used to express the fullness of quantities of things that don't necessarily have direct physical counterparts, or are singular For example:emotionsHe was full of anger.The knight was filled with courage.actionsA room full of applause.The party was filled with laughter.attributesHer garden is full of beauty.What are the most natural ways to express the fullness of these types of quantities
I found out that 古希 / こき can mean a 70 year old person, or the occasion of turning 70 years old. Apparently its etymology derives from an ancient song where this line occurs:七十古希 【しちじゅうこき】 which means "Men seldom live to be seventy" (Du Fu (c.712-c.770)); (Few people live to be seventy). Was 古希 a chinese word meaning rare or uncommon Is it used mainly to describe the special occasion of someone's seventieth birthday or is it used to describe one's seventieth year in the same way as はたち
I have seen a few sentences or exclamations that end a sentence with 「っ」. Specifically, I read the example below:ちなみに純文学について語れなんて言われても私には、無理・・・っ！The following sentence is listed below (However I'm not sure it is a "new sentence"):ですので基本的に私が紹介する小説作法は大衆小説についてのものであり、特に得意分野であるライトノベルに通用する話が多いと思います。Is the 「っ」necessary at the end of this sentence Does it have any meaning The only instance where I am familiar with the use of 「っ」is to indicate a pause when pronouncing something. However, since 「・・・」signifies a pause (I think), and an exclamation follows after the 「っ」, what does this actually mean Does 「・・・っ」　indicate that the last vowel is carried on for sometime, and then abruptly stopsWould it be any different if the sentence looked like the followingちなみに純文学について語れなんて言われても私には、無理・・・!
Of course I can use these but sometimes I am corrected by Japanese people when I use them in the wrong circumstance.

Spawned from What is the difference in terms of grammar between きり　and　っぱなし; I started thinking about ～かける.  Don't these essentially mean the same thing  I'm failing to see any difference except that maybe ～かける doesn't necessarily have a negative nuance to it.食べかけたリンゴ　→　An apple I started eating食べっぱなしのリンゴ　→　 (is it even grammatical; or used)やりかけた　→　Started but not finished ()やりっぱなし　→　Unfinished, incomplete
I want to know if there is any difference between に and を when used with 配慮する.Example sentences:[環境]{かんきょう}に配慮した家環境を配慮した家[相手]{あいて}の[立場]{たちば}に配慮する相手の立場を配慮するAre they interchangeable Does the meaning change at all(Googling gives many hits for both, but I feel like を should be not used in these situations).
I'm pretty sure there is a difference between the use of these two words. I came across the example sentences:息子は、自分の部屋に入ったきり出てこない。母は入院している父をつきっきりで看病している。電車が混んでいて、東京まで立ちっぱなしだった。I read from a textbook that きり　means 「〜ままずっと」 and that っぱなし　means 「ずっと+verb」. However, I'm thinking that the difference is that with きり, a negative situation exists that does not change (or does not hint at changing in the future). I also guess that っぱなし would indicate that a situation (negative) continued for a long time but then changed in the end. Does this seem correctI put the second example sentence because I was told by a native that when using　きり　it is usually followed by 〜ない. Though, the second example doesn't. Are there two possible meanings when using this grammatical form

In this context what does it mean Is it simply a short-hand listing for する verbs (similar to an &amp; sign) or perhaps something used to build some special type of compound verbs Also, how would that be read (e.g. pronounced) Considering that this is an encyclopedia article, is this convention formal or informal
だが is often attached to the subject/topic of a sentence as follows, with my supposed translation.近くに住む叔父だが, 最近具合が悪いと聞いている.  'Speaking of my uncle who lives close-by, I've heard lately he's isn't doing fine.'Does such だが give the subject a special meaning Is the translation correct
I know that, in Japanese, you can say X達【たち】 or Xら (where X is a first person pronoun) to say we.However, what rules should be followed for choosing that "X". Can I use whatever I would use to refer to myself and then add 達 / ら, or should I use a pronoun that would be acceptable for both myself and the other people included.Here's a specific example: Could a female say あたし達 to refer to herself and some males, or would あたし達 imply that everyone in the group is female (as it would in Spanish and probably similar languages)

Or other cases when a single word/particle is rendered in romaji within a sentence otherwise written in normal Japanese. This is something I first came across on cooking websites, for example:ルクエde白パン (where ルクエ refers to the cookware used)塩麴{しおこうじ}deあさりのパスタ (where 塩麴 is a notable ingredient)I've also seen it in advertising materials, for example a range of children's toys that you can use in the bath, made by トミカ is called 「おふろDEトミカ」The interesting part is that this seems to be much more common with "de" than with other particles, as far as I can tell (examples with "ni"/"no"/"to" exist but they seem to be less frequent - please correct me if I'm wrong on that).Actual questions:Is this usage influenced by the existence of "de" as a preposition in Spanish and FrenchIn cases like の, when the romaji version could be read as the English word "no"/shorthand for "number"/etc, is this avoided Used for punsIs this a very recent phenomenon Was there a particular source that popularised it (For example a popular cookbook or restaurant used it and the people I see on the internet doing the same are just copying that).Are there cases where this happens for other parts of a sentence, e.g. just one particular noun or verb rendered in romajiExamples of really good/bad puns using romaji in this manner also very welcome.

I was studying the expression 抱えて生きている (literally "living while holding"), and have found the best English equivalent to be "having to live with." In the English expression, the "thing" that one has to live with is almost always negative, unless you use the expression in an ironic way (ex., I have to live with all these hot co-eds staying at my place). In the Japanese examples I found, this negative implication seems to exist as well, but I was told that it is not necessarily so.Here are some examples that clearly illustrate the negative meaning:私はそのことを抱えて生きなければならない。  I have to live with that.私は持病を抱えて生きていくすべを身につけました。  I learned to live with my chronic disease.１０年間、家に病人を抱えて生きてきました。I've had to live in the same house as a sick person for 10 years.彼はいつも、何か問題を抱えて生きている。He is always living with some kind of problem.私は、あなたがいつか離れていくのでは、という不安を抱えながら生きていくのに、疲れました。I have become so tired from having to live with the anxiety that you will someday leave me. In the following example, my first translation gives the implication that the situation has a negative quality. In my second translation I attempt to more explicitly leave out this quality (the feeling of obligation that I imply may be wrong as well but that was my best shot). Does this expression always  contain a negative nuance (except in ironic statements) or is my assumption wrong If it is not always negative, could you provide an example where it is used to the contrary毎日、僕達は人に伝えたいことをいっぱい抱えて生きている。Everyday, we live with (the problem/difficulty of) having to express things to other people.Everyday, we live with having to express things to other people.Addendum: Most of these translations are mine, so feel free to point out any flaws.
In a Japanese English grammar textbook, "seems" is translated as ～のように見える, for example:He seemed to have been ill.  病気であったように見えた。I've also seen "seems" written as ～（の）ように思える in various example sentences on Space ALC:何の効果もないように思える。  It doesn't seem to have an effect.What's the difference in meaning and usage between ～（の）ようだ, ～（の）ように見える, ～（の）ように思える and ～みたい
If, for example, I wanted to say "I like the book that my sister gave me", would it be 姉がくれた本が好きですI'm using Genki to study, but they don't seem to have any examples of this particular structure that ends in "が好きです".
I ran across this example sentence in a basic dictionary, but I can't figure out what particular meaning まいります has in this context. 雨が降ってまいりました。Generally speaking, it's used as the humble verb for motion. In this case, [参]{まい}る replaces [来]{く}る. Why would this be attached to rain Is there another meaning or would this simply be a slightly formal way of talking
So I looked up つける and saw it can be written as:付ける着ける附けるAnd they all seem to have the exact same definition: to attach, to join, to add, to append, etc. So are these "spellings" interchangeable or is there some difference
Often, names are abbreviated using the initial letter in romanization, or some random letter, like "A". However, when the name has an affixal 子, that part is often left, like "A子". I have not seen any other character been treated like this. For example, I have not seen "A果", "A史", "A美", "A明", "A郎". Why is "子" treated speciallySomeone might answer that it is to indicate that the person is female. For that kind of answers, it means that the custom (not the answer) is based on prejudice and sexual discrimination for thinking that people's gender can be identified by the name and that "子" means female, and I would have further questions:Why don't they write the gender normally (explicitly) instead of trying to tuck that information into the abbreviated nameWhy is it necessary to indicate that the person is female just when the name ends with "子"Why is it not necessary to indicate that a person is maleWhat happens for males whose name end with "子"And of course, I appreciate other kinds of answers as well.
I wonder how exactly Japanese children learn to write. It may help a foreigner to know what is important to memorize or not. The only thing I know is that first of all, hiragana are learnt, and then in primary school they learn a set of kanjis each year.However, more exactly:at which age are hiragana and katakana learntare hiragana and katakana learnt at the same time Or first hiragana, and then katakanaat which age do they start learning kanjishow are kanjis learnt Do they have to memorize five by weekare all the on'yomi readings of a kanji memorized, or not at allwhen in secondary school, do they still have to learn other kanjis... and any other things about how Japanese children learn how to read and write Japanese
In English, if I want to talk about my Irish heritage, I would say "I'm Irish". I have an American passport, and I've never set foot in Ireland, but I still consider myself Irish. Both sides of my family have ancestors who came from Ireland, my name is Irish, etc. In Japanese, could I use アイルランド人 to the same effect On a related note, how could I talk about partial bloodlines For example, I'm mostly Irish, but I have some Native American and French blood, (and who knows what else) etc. PS I suppose technically the "correct" English term would be "Irish-American", but we don't always say that.
Take these words for example:木{もく}造{ぞう}: made of wood; woodenand金{きん}製{せい}: made of goldI have been under the impression that -製 is used for where an item has been manufactured (i.e. Made in Japan; Made in America), or the manufacturing of a certain product (i.e. iron manufacturing, etc.). I also thought that -造 was for what material something is made out of. Flipping through my dictionary it seems -製 is more common than -造 for referring to the material used (e.g. 鋼製: made of steel).Is there a rule about which materials use -造 and which use -製 Is it just something one has to learn
I came across [話]{はな}せます in the Japanese WOTD chat room.あなたは英語が話せますか？ Can you speak EnglishWhat's the difference between it and [話]{はな}します(Googling got some hits, but they were from user generated content, which isn't always reliable)
What's the best way to say "to miss" in the sense of feeling a longing for something, or that something pleasant is missing I understand there's [懐]{なつ}かしむ, but it seems to me that, like 懐かしい, is more appropriate for recalling your childhood home or a great vacation or something like that, not a "smaller" context like "I miss having lunch with you on the weekends" or something like that. Am I wrong
Sort of hinted by a recent question How would one express an opinion from the perspective of an inclusive group .Japanese titles in books, songs, shows, etc. are accompanied with a title (status) or an apposition when there is a name. It happens so often, as if it is a rule.三年B組金八先生  おじゃまんが山田くん  機動戦士ガンダム  超時空要塞マクロス  宇宙戦艦ヤマト  キャプテンハーロック  電子戦隊デンジマン  太陽戦隊サンバルカン  科学忍者隊ガッチャマン  元祖天才バカボン  プロゴルファー猿  オバケのQ太郎  忍者ハットリくん  Dr.スランプアラレちゃん  めぞん一刻  釣りキチ三平  男あばれはっちゃく    Sometimes, it is accompanied with an onomatopoeia, an interjection, or some short word.ハローサンディーベル  ゲゲゲの鬼太郎  こちら葛飾区亀有公園前派出所    Why did it happen to be like this
I've noticed that sometimes the hiragana の can be shortened to ん.For example, 部屋のなか → 部屋んなか (inside of the room)俺のうち → 俺んち (my house)俺のところ → 俺んとこ (my place)(More examples can be found in Derek's post.)Is there some explanation or rules that we have to observe when substituting の to ん Or can we arbitrarily substitute any の with ん as such: 「俺ん母さん」「俺んいえ」「俺んせんせい」「俺ん犬」「俺んテーブル」「NんN」

I have two words that I think mean the same thing:切手 - きって - stamp (postage)/merchandise certificate郵券 - ゆうけん - postage stampWhen I look at some sample sentences, the first one is used for both stamp and check. While the second one has no sample sentences but the Kanji makes a lot more sense. 郵券 - "Mail Ticket"; 切手 - "cut hand"So how would I use both I feel that 切手 would be used to describe stamps of any kind while 郵券 can only be used for postage stamps. Am I on the right track
I noticed that 煙 in the phrase 茶煙永日香{ちゃえんえいじつかんばし} sometimes appears as 烟. For example, here is a teapot with 茶煙永日香 and a scroll with 茶烟永日香. Is there a difference in meaning between 煙 and 烟煙 and 烟 obviously have similarities. Both mean "smoke" or "fumes", and both have the 火 radical on the left. Both appear appropriate for decorative uses.However, the right part of 烟, 因, means "cause" or "association", while the right part of 煙, 垔, appears to mean "block" or "dam". These radicals seem pretty different.This same question was asked in 知恵袋. The answer was simply that they mean the same thing, but that 烟 is not standard and thus less common.Perhaps I am over-thinking things, but are the meanings of 煙 and 烟 truly identical, or do the right radicals suggest some subtle difference in meaning
Often times, it is common for a speaker to make an assertion or opinion based upon a (ethnic or social) group to which they belong. In English it is common to use prefixes like "we" or "us" to indicate this. For example:We Americans love hamburgers.We Trekkies believe that Klingon is a better alternative to English.Is there an equivalent to this in Japanese Using the first example as a baseline, a possible translation could be to use の as a modifier, and could be rendered as:[私達]{わたしたち}のアメリカ[人]{じん}はハンバーガーが[大好]{だいす}きだよ！But I have no idea how this would be interpreted by native speakers.Also, since idea of making statements based upon an inclusive group may be seen differently depending on the culture, if someone could tie in some tidbits as to how common it is to use expressions like this, how they reflect upon social status, or any other important things to note, that'd be great.

I was taught that [私]{わた(く)し}, [僕]{ぼく}, and 俺{おれ} are the most common first-person pronouns.Recently, I stumbled upon the word [我]{われ}, which supposedly means the same thing. An online dictionary lists all of them as common. Since I haven't heard about 我 until now, I wonder how common it is. What is 我, and how does it differ from the other common first-person pronounsWhich is the right plural form: [我々]{われわれ} or 我ら{われら}
ブチャイクAll I know is it's referring to someone's "looks" or appearance, and is not flattering. I suspect this is simply one of those "modern" Japanese slang phrases popular among young people that's just a result of an intentional abuse/twisting of the original language. I'd like to know what it means, where it comes from, etc.I still have some questions.I know of "不細工", but what is the connection between "ぶちゃいく" and "ぶさいく"Also, while I can guess the meaning of "ブスカワ", please explain it anyway. If I'm not mistaken, this is also slang, and it's not a good idea to answer a question about slang with slang. Please use standardized language to answer. I don't have problem reading Japanese up to a level of the standard news article, so linking to a pure Japanese page for reference is fine, so long as the explanation that pertains to this question is not filled with slang or somesuch. (Although for the benefit of anyone else reading this question, it might be best to also provide a brief English explanation to accompany it.)
From Noir, Episode 2 (anime).I don't get what the って is doing in this sentence. For context, the father came home early from work. He quickly answers his wife in the first sentence then in the second sentence is asking his son this:そうか。そうだアンリ、欲しがってたゲーム、明日パパと買いに行こうか？

I came across this phrase in a Haruki Murakami short story, and I was wondering if this is just a literal translation of the English phraseI tried googling the Japanese phrase, but I could only find it as a Japanese translation for the English phrase (such as here: http://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/leaf/ej3/7427/m0u/%A5%BC%A5%C3%A5%AD%A1%BC%A5/). If it is in a 国語辞典, then I couldn't find it, but I'm also not really sure where to look for phrases instead of single words...If this is just a literal use of the English phrase, would a typical native Japanese speaker know what it means, where it came from, etc.Also, while I'm asking, is this something that Murakami does often I've often read that Murakami writes "American Japanese" but I've never really understood what is meant by that.
Writing Japanese requires a mix of Kanji and Hiragana, usually some Katakana as well.I have read that some Kanji characters can be replaced with Hiragana characters for easier writing.My question is: can all Kanji characters be replaced Can I write Japanese only with Hiragana or only in Katakana and be fully understood
I'm not understanding the subtleties of [視点]{してん} vs 観点{かんてん}.I know that they both mean something like "point of view", and given the existence of two of them, one of them probably implies more consideration than the other, but I'm not sure which one is which.
Is there a reference that lists words whose honorific and/or humble forms are suppletiveFor nouns, I am supposing that 父親, 父, and お父さん are different forms of a single noun differing only with respect to honorification.For verbs, there are rules to create the honorific form, but some verbs are irregular. For example, the honorific and the humble forms of 食べる are 召し上がる and いただく, respectively. Another example is 知ります with ご存知です as the honorific and 存じております as the humble form.How can I know whether a verb or noun is regular or it uses suppletion

In the pattern ～よう　～まい, I've found from several sources that you can use が and と (i.e ～ようが　～まいが), and using one over the other doesn't change the meaning or have a particular nuance. What's confusing me is that I've found one instance of this pattern using か, and I can't find if there is anything in particular that distinguishes it from the が / と version or not, or if it's a typo, or what. Can anyone shed some light on this

The sentence: ほかにも先勝{せんしょう}は午後{ごご}は良{よ}くない日{ひ}とされ、反対{はんたい}に、先負{せんぶ}は午後{ごご}が良{よ}い日{ひ}とされ、また赤口{しゃっこう}は昼{ひる}だけが良{よ}い日{ひ}だとされています。No matter how much I progress in Japanese, the 「は」and「が」 distinction still gets the better of me. I can't justify why 「は」 was used to many times, especially. Is this kind of sentence pattern unusual It's in my Japanese textbook.I was under the impression that in sentences that have a passive voice (e.g. される, right), then 「は」 would normally become 「に」. E.g., 食器洗いが誰かにされた → The washing up was done by somebody.

I can't understand the difference between うち and よそ. I learned that they are used in polite speech, for example:╔════════╦═════════╦═════════════╗║        ║  うち    ║   よそ      ║╠════════╬═════════╬═════════════╣║ 言います║ 申します ║ おっしゃいます║╚════════╩═════════╩═════════════╝
Why are different words 算数 and 数学 used for mathematics at and after elementary school I understand that the quality is different in that, in the former, the method of solving an equation is usually not allowed, and special calculation methods that developed within the 和算 tradition are used, but is that different enough to be considered as different academic fields I don't see any more difference between these two methods than the difference between number theory, algebra, geometry, calculus, combinatorics, etc. which are all subsumed under 数学.
I'm studying grammar, and one of the new forms that I'm learning uses the word まだしも. I looked it up and I found:類語：まだいいが　/ まだ何とかなるがBased on how the word is used in the following examples:1人や2人ならまだしも，10人も事務所へ押し掛けて来て参ったI could have handled [coped with] one or two of them, but I was flabbergasted when ten people pushed their way into my office.寒いだけならまだしも，おなかがすいてきたI was not only cold but also hungry.／I would not have minded the cold so much, but I also began to feel hungry.I'm wondering if まだしも can be broken into multiple parts まだ, し, and も. Where まだ would indicate "as yet; hitherto; still; not yet". If this is possible, what role does しand も play in the context of this word I'm wondering why し and も constitute to the "いいが" or "何とかなるが" portion. Specifically が.
I have seen the words 売春 and 買春 pronounced　"ばいしゅん". From my understanding 売春 is taken from the perspective of the "seller" whereas 買春 is taken from the perspective of the "buyer". However, when I pronounced the later as "ばいしゅん" in front of a native, I was told that it is pronounced "かいしゅん" (買春). Is this reading valid and does it carry a different context when pronounced this way than the former reading

I think that ～たり～たりする generally means "do things like (among other things)", but in dictionary definitions, can the pattern ～たり～たりする mean "and", "or" or "and/or"In e.g. XたりYたりする would it imply that both X and Y occur or can X occur without Y occurring (or vice versa)In the Daijisen definition for よく for example, it's used in the following way:困難なことをしたり、考えられないような喜ばしい結果を得たりして感じ入るさま。Being impressed by something which takes difficulty (or and and/or) the achievement of an unthinkably delightful outcome.How would it differ from dictionary form verb+ことや (if "or") and ～て/～で (if "and") etc

It looks like Japanese text don't use spaces between words, not even in informal messages (yes perhaps in textbooks, but I digress). This page claims that a sentence with spaces inbetween just looks weird, example:私の名前は ゆかです。But it seems like Japanese subtitles in Jdramas / animes etc use spaces, not just once or twice, but all the time. On the contrary, the comma 、 is almost non-existent. It's almost as if each comma in a subtitle is replaced with a space instead. I'm using the subtitles posted on d-addicts as an example. Out of over 2000 Japanese sub files, only roughly ~5%* contain the 、 character. In some files, the comma actually only appeared once or twice.Some threads like 東野圭吾 and 秘密諜報員 エリカ did not state the original source of the subtitles, but others like 医龍 3 and ちりとてちん do claim to have the subtitles extracted from the TV broadcast:These subtitles were extracted from the corresponding TV broadcast. Text wasn’t edited in any way. Due to some technical reasons there might be several missing characters and/or lines. Timing is not perfect but still good (at least not worse than original timing for TV).D-addicts' examples of using spaces instead of comma:Anime mkv files also have "built-in" subs using spaces instead of comma, for example the movie Mugiwara Chase:Why is it that instead of using commas, Japanese subtitles use spaces insteadWhat is the reason for this oddity==*List of d-addict files with comma:１リットルの涙 # 1-21 Litre of Tears # 8Aishiteru # 1Ashita no Kita Yoshio # 11Atami no Sousakan # 3Bara no nai Hanaya # 1-4BOSS # 4-8Buzzer Beat # 11Cat Street # 1-5Celeb to Binbo Taro # 7Fuyu no Sakura # 9Gakko ja Oshierarenai! #2GM Odore Doctor # 9Gokusen 3rd ep06, # 8Haken no Hinkaku # 1Hanayome no Chichi # SPHayami san to Yobareru Hi # 2Honboshi ~ Shinri Tokuso Jikenbo # 2Innocent Love # 3Isshun no Kaze ni Nare # SP part 3Kaeru no Ojou sama # 4, 5Kamen Rider Double # 1-17Kansahojin # 5Keibuho Yabe Kenzo # 4, 5Kimi Hannin Janai yo ne # 8Koukousei Restaurant # 5Kurumi no Heya # 1-6Last Friends # 8Last Money ~Ai no Nedan~ # 1Lost Time Life # 1Lotto 6 de 3 oku 2 senman En Ateta Otoko # 5Maou # 5, 11Marumo no Okite # 4Monster Parent # 1Nanase Futatabi # 8Nihongo de Kurasou # 1Nihonjin no Shiranai Nihongo # 1-2Nemureru Mori # 1-12Ohitorisama # 7Ohsama_no_resutoran # 1-3Orthros no Inu # 1-3, 5, 8-9Piece Vote # 6Ryoukiteki Na Kanojo # 4-5Saigo no KizunaShanghai Typhoon # 4Shikaotoko Aoniyoshi # 1-2Soredemo, Ikite Yuku # 6Stand Up!! # 7Sunao ni Narenakute # 4Tenshi no Wakemae # 1-3Tomorrow # 8-10Umareru # 10Unfair the special ~Double Meaning Nijuu TeigiZettai Kareshi # 5-6デカ黒川鈴木 # 4MR.

What is the connotation when using 〜ものだから　and 〜もの in a sentence In my text, they state these examples:The first set is 〜ものだから：上着を脱いでもいいですか。　暑いものですから。Can I take my jacket off I'm feeling a bit hot.遅くなってごめん。　道路が混んでいたもんだから。I'm sorry I'm late. I got caught in a traffic jam.The second set is 〜もの:パーティーには行かなかったよ。　知らなかったんだもの。I didn't go to the party, because I didn't know it was on.しょうがないよ。　子供なんだもん。It can't be helped. He's just a kid.I was told that one is used more often to assert a reason or excuse for something being done, and the other for expressing feeling. Is this trueOther than that, is there any defining line between the two examplesEDIT: I removed the question about whether a form was meant for subjectivity or objectivity.
When expressing "to leave," as in "I left the store," or "I can leave the country," is there a difference in nuance or meaning between the verbs 出る and 去るまあ、少なくとも、この国を出ることはできるな。   Well, at least I can leave this country.まあ、少なくとも、この国を去ることはできるな。   Well, at least I can leave this country.　（？）店を出ると、犬を連れた二人の中年女性が通りかかりました。  When I left the shop, two middle-aged women with dogs were passing by.店を去ると、犬を連れた二人の中年女性が通りかかりました。  When I left the shop, two middle-aged women with dogs were passing by.()私は、そこを去って別の電気製品を1時間近く見たところで、また「肩モミ椅子」の辺りにやってきました。  I moved on and after looking at other things for about an hour came by the chair display again.私は、そこを出て別の電気製品を1時間近く見たところで、また「肩モミ椅子」の辺りにやってきました。  I moved on and after looking at other things for about an hour came by the chair display again.()

I often see the alphabet W being transcribed or pronounced as "ダブル" rather than "ダブリュー" in Japanese, and I think that in most cases, that was not what was meant. Indeed, there seems to be a practice of abbreviating  "ダブリュー" as W, most often seen in a menu in a fast food restaurant, (whose meaning intentionally or unintentionally goes along with the origin of W being "double 'U' "), but even out of that context, I observe it being transcribed/pronounced as "ダブル", and I don't know if people are doing it because of the origin of the alphabet character W. Why do you think that happens
From what I understand, すら is commonly used with the negative conjugation (~ない, ~なかった) of verbs.For example:「ひらがなすら書けない。」 I expected (him) to be able to write hiragana. But even hiragana, (he) can't write.「涙すら出なかった。」 I expected tears to fall. But even tears, didn't fall. (I expect him to cry but he didn't even wept a tear.)Basically I was wondering is it grammatical to use すら with the positive conjugation of a verbFor example, can 「涙すら出た。」 be considered grammatical, assuming the context is that the speaker expected "no tears to fall", but indeed "tears did fall"

I wanted to know the correct way to spell a compound word in Japanese, and was wondering if there is a verb that correlates to "to spell" in the Japanese language. I found 綴る, but was told this is used only for foreign languages; as I was told, it may be used in a linguistic context to speak of spelling in Japanese, but in common usage it is used mainly to refer to the spelling of foreign words.To sum it up, if I want to know the kana spelling of a word or compound word (for instance １件）what would be a few ways to ask this  Is the word 綴る used primarily in linguistic contexts If I want to ask friends or acquaintances, are there other terms besides 書く, スペル or 読む to use Would 仮名遣い be okay to use in this context(I wanted to avoid saying something like そのスペルを教えてください。／そのスペルは？ as this seemed too easy)
My understanding is that a subtitle is expressed with the symbol 〜 in Japanese like this:Main Title ~ Subtitle  Main Title ~Subtitle~I am not sure about whether there is supposed to be a space on either side of the ~ symbol, or whether the symbol should be on both sides or one side. Is there a clear mentioning of this usageIn other languages I know, colon : is used for this purpose, and it looks very peculiar of Japanese to use this symbol for this purpose. Is this only in Japanese How did the usage arise

I am still in a very early stage in learning Japanese, and just I have just learnt some numbers and my first counter words, such as the ones for telling time and まい.Do you ever use "regular" numbers (いち, に, さん, etc.) for anything or are they always modified (ひとつ, ふたつ, みっつ, etc.) or followed by some counterI still don't know any kanji; that is why I use kana, and I hope you can provide kana in your replies as well.
I was a little confused by the following sentence because 条件 is a regular noun, but looking at examples I see that it means "on the condition of [object]": 財政危機におちいっているギリシャは、 緊縮を条件に、ヨーロッパのほかの国から支援を受けていますI'm wondering, was there a verb that just isn't said anymoreAnd I'm trying to think of other example constructs like it, but haven't come up with anything.

Does V~たりする include the mentioned verb in a "perfect" (specific) sense or "varying" senseFor example, in the sentence 「映画を見たりした。」, is (1) or (2) a more accurate depiction of the meaning of the sentence :I did stuff such as watching movie/s etc. (I watched movie/s, and besides that, I did other stuff.)I did stuff like watching movie/s etc. (I did stuff comparable to watching movie/s, and besides that, I did other stuff.)As another example, does 「歌ったり、踊ったりした。」 mean (1) or (2) :I did stuff such as singing, dancing, etc. (I sang, I danced, and besides that, I did other stuff.)I did stuff like singing, dancing etc. (I did stuff comparable to singing, I did stuff comparable to dancing, and besides that, I did other stuff.)

Sometimes, for stylistic or rhetorical effect, one wants to delay mentioning a word/concept until the end of a sentence. For example, it's often best to save the punchline for the very end:I was happy to discover that my ex was sentenced to life in prison for arson, murder, and jaywalking.If we directly translate into a Japanese-style word order—((My ex)-NOM (Arson, murder, and jaywalking)-for ((life in prison)-to sentenced) was) that I discover happy was.—the utterance hemorrhages much of "jaywalking"'s comic effect into the bog of unnecessary background and framing information.Whereas English word order naturally places the word where we want it, if we instead wanted to place it somewhere else, English makes available alternative or periphrastic phrasings, such as "x did y." → "It was y that x did."So likewise: what techniques or periphrastic constructions are available in Japanese to move words or clauses
I am going over the cases when に and で are used with location. According to the "Dictionary of Basic Japanese Grammar", に is used when something exists in a specific location (page 299) and で is used for events taking place at specific locations (page 105.)The difference is rather clear, however there are two exceptions: 住む and 勤める. While I can understand that 住む might mean "to exist", the meaning of 勤める is less clear (I exist working at the office). Are there other examples/exceptions to this
What is the meaning of and difference between ～を中心に and ～をめぐってSpace ALC defines ～を中心に as "with a focus on" and ～をめぐって as "centering on", but I'm having trouble figuring out the meaning and difference in usage of the two.I saw the following example sentence for ～を中心に in the (old) JLPT2 完全マスター, which JGram interpreted slightly differently to me:駅を中心に沢山の商店が集まっている。My first interpretation: "In the station there are lots of stores grouped together."JGram's interpretation (which I now think is more accurate): "Centered around the station there are many stores."The way I now understand it is that ～を中心に means more "([focused/centered/revolving]) around" rather than "in the center of something". Would this explanation be accurateI've also encountered ～をめぐって a couple of times. The following example I read today in the April 2012 edition of 中央公論:政党というものは、単に選挙をめぐって候補者をリクルートし、有権者へ働きかけて動員するための組織ではない。  My attempted translation: "A political party isn't an organization which is simply about recruiting candidates focusing on elections and encouraging mobilization of voters."If I switched をめぐって with を中心に, would it have the same or similar meaning What would the differences in nuance be between the two
I had the impression that 何 is pretty common kanji and that it is used in situations as above (after all, 今 is there, so it is not that it wanted to be hiragana-only). Do I understand it right that it could be written as 今何してる and if yes, what is the reason it is written 今なにしてる instead

Note: I know they might not strictly be interchangeable, but I might end up using "Furigana" and "Ruby text" in an interchangeable manner in this question.Hi all,I'm in the process of writing a short essay in Japanese. I'm going to be preparing two versions: one with Ruby text on all Kanji that are new to me (for further self-study purposes), and one with Ruby text on a subset of the more complex Kanji used.When I craft a Japanese sentence and decide to place Furigana by a specific Kanji, do I need to use Hiragana each timeI've noticed, in the dictionaries I use at the very least, that Onyomi readings are listed in Katakana and Kunyomi readings in Hiragana. Does this style carry across to essays and similar types of documentsFor instance, if I want t to use the kanji 上 in a sentence and explicitly mark the reading as うえ I would use Hiragana in my ruby text. But what if I wanted to use 日 in a sentence and explicitly mark the reading as ニチ Would I still use Hiragana thenI know that these are stupid examples, but I think that they still illustrate my question enough.

I would like to understand this Zen calligraphy:                                                   I gather that it says "hōgejaku" and that this means something like "let it go", "throw it away", "throw it down". According to this page, the kanji are 放下著, but I find it hard to see the similarity, especially for the last one. The first two do have on readings of "hō" and "ge", respectively, and the New Nelson character dictionary has the compound 放下 with reading "hōka" and meaning "throwing down; juggling". The last one, however, appears to have neither a reading "jaku", nor a meaning indicating an imperative.The page offering the calligraphy for sale says:The three characters of this print express the Zen principle of releasing all negative, selfish thoughts and emotions [...].This book says:In Japan's traditional interpretation of Zen, either grammatical markers appearing in Baihua were accepted in the form of Chinese or individual characters as grammatical markers were read in Japanese as follows: [...] -zhuo2 (Imperative): -jaku-seyo. This is ascribed to the fact that bilingualism was practiced at the Zen temples in Kamakura Gozan when Zen was imported to Japan.A translation of Shobogenzo Zuimonki relates the Zen connection as follows:Hoge in Japanese means to let go, throw away, give up, abandon, lay down, etc. Someone asked Joshu, “I have nothing. How is that”  Joshu replied, “Throw it away (hoge-jaku).”However, this book gives a different meaning:There is a Japanese Zen expression "Hogejaku". This expression is often interpreted as "to throw away or give up everything," implying from now on. But this isn't what it means. Rather, the meaning is that "everything has already fallen away or been thrown away," and it points to your condition right now.I'd appreciate any information related to the expression, the calligraphy and/or the Zen background; in particular:How would you translate this phrase into EnglishWhich kanji are being usedIs it an imperative, and if so, how is it being formedIs this something a present-day native Japanese speaker would readily understandIs there a "canonical" version of the associated Zen story
So far I don't see any logic to it. It seems like it's just something you have to memorize, or is there a trick that I'm missing.UpdateTo clarify, I'm not so much questioning the existence of the counter words, simply wondering how you determine which ones to use and when. Having followed the advice of reading the wikipedia article I see that they are in fact words with their own meaning and not just simple suffixes. It was much more confusing to think of them as suffixes because it was baffling to imagine why a concise language like japanese would need so many different counting suffixes.
Particularly in the following phrases, what's the difference between どうしたらいい and どうしていい The following both seem to mean something like "I don't know what to do":どうしたらいいか分かりませんどうしていいか分かりませんIs there some difference between どうして and どうしたら which changes the nuance or meaning somehowIs どうしたらいいか分かりません stronger in meaning than どうしていいか分かりません
もったいない (勿体無い)(勿体ない) can mean "what a waste!" / "too good".Apparently it is originally () a buddhist term meaning “The essence or quality of the thing does not exist,” and supposedly has been popularized in recent years by environmentalists.I saw it used in this context:24時間365日、どこにいてもこれからは、もうずーっと素直でいる。じゃないと今日の興味にも失敗にも向き合えないまま。もったいないから素直でいる！Wherever I find myself, I want to live honestly, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.If not, I wouldn't be able to face the joy or failure that each day brings  .I don't want to waste time (on that) so I will stay true to myself!My friend told me the most common usage of もったいない is when receiving a gift, as in "too good. i don't deserve it" . She says it is also used, for example, when one leaves food uneaten, to be thrown away, as in "what a waste."What is the connection of the buddhist term to both of these meanings and what is the most common use and meaning of this phrase(I am interested most in its colloquial manifestations)The very loose translation of this passage was mine, so any corrections of mistakes or misinterpretations is appreciated. (In particular, I don't understand how the Japanese writer is using this word here)reference:http://www.seattlebetsuin.com/EcoSangha/glossary.htm
My understanding --admittedly limited-- is that in Japanese, people say as much as they can with as little words as possible. So I wondered why ないだろう　would be used in everyday speaking instead of まい The latter seems shorter and easier to use than the former.
Today I noticed this article about eating disorders in Japan, which I got to via the News on Japan site.The first line jumps out at me. Supposedly, in an interview, a 25 year old Japanese woman named "Hachiko" says:In Japanese there are no words for “I’m suffering” or “I’m sad”. I  can’t share my feelings with anyone. Needing help is seen as failure,  something to be ashamed of.Maybe needing help is seen as failure, but I can think of a few ways to say "I'm suffering" or "I'm sad". Just off the top of my head:私{わたし}は悲{かな}しいあたしは苦{くる}しんでいます自分{じぶん}の置{お}かれた状態{じょうたい}はきついSo I'm wondering, is this just a reporter's ham-fisted attempt to inflate the human drama by painting a picture of a cruel and uncaring Japanese culture that exacerbates eating disordersOr is there any logical justification at all for claiming that the nuances of the Japanese language don't accurately convey the suffering someone with an eating disorder might feel

Here is one definition for より:より (adv,prt) (1) from; out of; since; at; (2) than; (3) other than; except; but; (4) more; I see that one of the definitions of this word is "more". Is より一層 a different word altogether, or does it derive its より from the one defined aboveより一層 (よりいっそう) (exp,adv) (1) still more; even more; much more; all the more; further; (exp,adj-no) (2) increased; greaterAre all these examples of より  the same word How are they different from one another1.Ａのほうが、Ｂより大きい夢ですA is a bigger dream than B.2.Ａは、より大きい夢です A is a bigger dream.3.Ａは、より一層大きい夢ですA is an even bigger dream.()4.Ａより大きい夢ですA bigger dream than A. ()Are these translations correct In reference to how I translated number 4, see this example:外国人ですから顔のつくりも体も日本人より大きいですが、だからといって私の雰囲気が怖いとは、とても思えません。Because I'm a foreigner, my facial structure and my body are relatively big as compared to a Japanese, but I don't think I have a scary aura about me at all.
Earlier today I saw this sign:煙{けむり}の行方{ゆくえ}。本人{ほんにん}だけが、他人{たにん}事{ごと}だった。The English is different enough that I think we can mostly ignore it for the purposes of this question. It helpfully conveys the message, but I'm wondering about the grammar of the Japanese, from which the provided English is quite different.In particular, I'm wondering about the use of だけが. だけ is "just" or "only", and が is "but", so my reading of this is "Other people's problem, but only/just the person themselves." That's not merely deliberately ungrammatical English to convey my confusion, it also seems to convey the opposite message than intended. It seems to be saying that the smoke is only just the smoker's problem, no one elses.From the context and the English provided, I know it's supposed to say, "not just the smoker, it's other people's issue as well."But I just don't see how だけが means "not just", instead of "but only."What am I not understanding about だけが
I was pretty sure that 切{き}った meant something was cut from something else. So ケーキから一人分{ひっとりぶん}を切{き}った would mean, "one piece was cut from the cake."However, I came across a usage which, at least at first, doesn't seem to conform to that understanding. In my JLPT textbook, there is this graph showing the number of people in the farming industry (ignore the red line, it's just a pen mark):One question asked which of four sentences best describes the change from the beginning to the end of the graph. This is the correct answer:一千{いっせん}万人{まんにん}を上回{うわまわ}っていたものが、300万{まん}人{にん}を切{き}った。My erroneous interpretation was that the sentence meant something like "There were over 10 million people, but 3 million were cut." Or, in other words, 3 million cut from 10 million leaves 7 million remaining. But the graph shows it's 3 million remaining, not 7 million, so I didn't think this was the right answer.Instead, after checking the answers and seeing that this sentence is indeed the correct description, I'm now guessing the sentence is supposed to mean "There were over 10 million people, but it was cut down to 3 million."However, I can't see how in this sentence 切{き}った means "cut down to", and not "cut from".What is it that I am not seeing in this sentence, or what am I not understanding about 切{き}る

As explained in this question, a dash character is used in katakana as an extension of a sound.First, what exactly is this character called A "nobasu mark"Anyway, I saw this sign in Shibuya the other day:It's not a remarkable advertisement. It simply says 「ケータイ代{だい}に悩{なや}まない３年間{ねんかん}を。」, which means something like "Get a three year worry free mobile phone service plan." (Very loose translation.)What struck me though is that in this case, they are using katakana for a word for which there is kanji: 携帯{けいたい}, and in that kanji, the first character is read けい. Not けえ.I always thought that the purpose of ー was to extend the same sound from the previous character. Or, in other words, use the same 段{だん}, or "vowel row", in the hiragana syllabry. So the ー in ラーメン represents あ because it follows ら, both in the あ段{だん}.Intuitively, of couse I recognize that ケー is probably more of a phonetic representation than anything rule based.So, more out of curiousity than anything else, is there any set of rules which determine what exact sound a ー should be I feel that as someone who has gained a familiarity with Japanese, I just unquestioningly intuit the reading for ー when I come across it, but if one were to try and explain it to someone completely new to Japanese, how would you do it

I'm confused whether it is normally appropriate to use On-readings or Kun-readings when dealing with people's names; I'm fine when its just two character names; I just make a logical deduction in my head to how to say their name; but when I try to pronounce names with 3 kanji together, I'm completely lost.I'll bring in examples at a later time, this computer can't easily type kanji.

I remember hearing that the Japanese government planned on abolishing the use of Chinese characters entirely after World War II. I also remember hearing that there was a movement by the American government to change the Japanese writing system to use an English-based alphabet system (maybe similar to romanization of Japanese).

I read an article that had the sentence1.9GHz帯を使うため、ZigBeeやWi-Fiで使われている2.4GHz帯の機器と干渉しないことが特徴。I previously learned that 混信 means "interference" or "jamming". I saw this word used often.

However, I'm not able to derive the meaning of 干渉.

Can someone please explain the fine nuances of these two  Things such as:Are there conditions/restrictions of when you can use one or the otherWhat are the "approximate" time periods that each coversAnything else relevant...Here's an example I saw on a particular website.最近Xの機能を使ってきたみたい、ね！　→　What it actually said最近Xの機能を使うようになったみたい、ね！　→　What I thought it should have said
I've often heard this pattern, particularly in things likeメッセージ／メール　を　ありがとうございます。Since ありがとうございます is an adjective, why is it acceptable to use を in this situation  That seems about as grammatically correct as saying something like 雪を寒いです.Is there some kind of underlying grammatical-correctness to this, or is this just something that was misused and then became acceptable over time
I've seen this a couple of times in newspapers. For example:....は山口、広島両県の....I can't find it in any dictionary. My gut feeling is that it indicates a sort of union between the two prefectures, in this case between Yamaguchi and Hiroshima. Can someone confirm or clarify this

朝の6時 seems to be consistent with using の　to have one noun modify another, while 朝6時 appears to be just two successive nouns (which I wouldn't think would be a grammatically valid construction).
I usually see the word 連載 pertaining to articles or books in a series. However, when I read 順次 I was confused (I saw this is a technical article). They seem to both hold the meaning "serial" or "consecutive" or "in series". Is 連載 exclusively used when referring to books, articles, novels, etc.

I'm trying to translate a company name ("puddle") in to Japanese. I put it into Google Translate, but when you translate words, you're translating their meaning rather than the word itself, which is usually what you're looking for. But when translating a company name, essentially you want to find the letter for letter equivalent of that name. What's the best way to approach this Also, how can you check that you haven't accidentally translated your company name into an obscenity

I was reading through " How do I say "I am the best"  の,は or が and 私 or 俺 ", and I was wondering what's the difference between "俺が一番" and "俺が最高"From what I know, both roughly equates to "I am the best".However is there any difference in nuance between "俺が一番" and "俺が最高"
Both come up with the same reading and definition in Jisho.org (round/circular), and both are listed as common words. Is there any preference between the two or should I simply learn both as interchangeable
I've seen this in a few texts now and since it's appeared with some frequency I thought to post the question here.

onsenjapan.net claims that タオル is used for "towel", presumably the large one. When I asked a staff member at Odeo onsen "これ は 何 ですか" while indicating the large towel I was holding, the staff member said "タオル".I'm not 100% convinced, though. I half suspect that the glossary (and the staff member) may have chosen a gairaigo term over more traditional terms since it'd be easier for foreigners to remember. Also, in English the terms "large towel" and "small towel" feel very clumsy to me, so I would have thought that Japanese would have kept its existing words for the large towel and small towel.I tried seeing if towel was mentioned in http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/温泉 , but unlike the English-language version it didn't (obviously only foreigners need to google how to use an onsen!). Other pages I tried looking at were this, this, this, and this - the fact that towels don't appear in those glossaries would be consistent with it being plain old boring gairaigo, and that Japanese doesn't have special onsen-related terminology for towels.Is タオル used for the towels used at onsen, both the large towel and the small one, or are other words used as well
I'm pretty sure ～れに～れて is a grammar form that I have studied in my JLPT textbooks, but I came across it again in a text and I can't for the life of me find it again in my grammar dictionaries. I also looked on JGram, but couldn't find it there.The particular case I came across was:人間{にんげん}は昔{むかし}、遅{おく}れに遅{おく}れて自{みずか}らの年{とし}を自覚{じかく}する。Without knowing what 遅{おく}れに遅{おく}れて is doing, I feel I'm missing an important nuance.I think it's something like, "From long ago, people have been slow to be conscious of their own age." But how is the above sentence different from this one:人間{にんげん}は昔{むかし}、遅{おそ}くて自{みずか}らの年{とし}を自覚{じかく}する。...
There are people in Japan who seem to think nothing of sniffling their nose indefinitely as they sit in a coffee shop, in an office, on a train, or anywhere with other people around. Sometimes surprisingly loudly. I've heard some guys who sound like their grinding espresso in their noses.Sometimes it can be really grating. Just a few moments ago, a person was sitting near me, sniffling away, and this was one of the loud ones. So I decided to take action. I had a pack of tissues on me that someone had handed to me last night, so I offered it to the sniffler. My hope was that handing over tissues alone would communicate the whole message of "Please use these to blow your nose because your sniffling is annoying."However, the sniffler took it, and thanked me, and then set it on the table as if it were just some gift. A few more sniffles later, I turned and asked if they understood why I gave it to them. It seemed they didn't grasp it, so I tried to explain. Here's where things got a little murky.It seemed I couldn't find the right word for "sniffle" to express what I was talking about. I tried:鼻{はな}をすする... and:グスグスする... both of which I found in a dictionary. Neither seemed to convey the point. The sniffler looked at me like I was from Mars.Now, there may be a bit of a cultural miss here. I've been in Japan so long I honestly don't remember if people sniffling without ever just blowing their nose once to just get it over with is a common occurrence elsewhere or not. It seems in any case that in Japan, it's just not something that is given any particular thought. I've been through this a few times and it seems people are genuinely surprised that I notice, or that I can hear it, or whatever.So it might be possible that I'm using the right words, but assuming a context that can not be assumed, in which case I need to find the right words to convey the situation, not just to convey the single sniffling element.Bottom line, though, what words should I use to describe sniffling What words would I use to suggest someone blow their nose, both polite and impolite
I think from looking up ありき that it means "based on", but it's usage is unclear to me.I've come across it in these two examples:まずは結論{けつろん}ありきWhich I think means "the conclusion is based on the premise." Or, in other words, that the question is begged.初{はじ}めに言葉{ことば}ありき"In the beginning, there was the word." I believe that's a more or less standard translation of the phrase from the Bible. But it doesn't say "based on," so would it be accurate to say a more literal translation is "the beginning is based on the word"Assuming I'm right about the meaning, then are the phrases above complete sentences Does ありき acts in the same way です or だ does It's not a verb, so what is itNote that my goal is not so much to classify it and give it a name, as it is to understand how to use it so I can make my own sentences with it. So an answer that gets marked as correct would contain instructions for usage.Here's my attempt to create a sentence using ありき:合格{ごうかく}は動力{どうりょく}ありき。Does that mean "success is based on effort," like I think it should Is it a complete sentence
It seems from my JLPT study books, and also my computer's IME, that 気{き}を遣{つか}う is the preferred kanji for "paying attention to, having concern for".However, I noticed that on Space ALC if you look up 気{き}を遣{つか}う, it redirects you to 気{き}を使{つか}う, which, according to both it and Rikaichan, means the exact same thing.Is there any difference It seems 気{き}を遣{つか}う is more common, but can that be confirmed
A friend posted this in a comment on Facebook:これは深{ふか}い意味{いみ}があるような気{き}がしなくもないI think I get the general meaning, which is "This seems to have a deep meaning." But I'm fuzzy on the implications of しなくもない.Is it a contraction of かも知{し}れない Something else

I have a sentence that starts with それに伴い which I'm trying to translate. I'm assuming that it's a more polite version of それに伴って.

I heard this sentence pattern watching an anime (where A and B have similar meanings, but B is much stronger):．．．．[description A] いや、もはや [description B]と言っていい。I looked up もはや expecting a definition like "rather", as in "it was [A], or rather, it was [B]". Instead I found "already, now", as in "He is no longer a child" もはや子供ではない。I looked around and that's the only definition I've found...however, I did see that on goo it did say まさに was a word for it, which means "exactly". I'm guessing that would make this mean "[A], or more exactly [B]". Can someone confirm this This wasn't a secondary entry in the definition, just a line in the first, "already" definition, but it seems to me a very different usage. Can someone clarify this for me
I think that this verb is the only one I've seen in Japanese that has so many definitions.　とる　and つく have multiple definitions as well (quite a bit IIRC). But not as many as 掛ける. In any case, I am just wondering if anyone knew the reason. Secondary question, do people tend to use an alternative more often than the 掛ける version For example: でんわをする instead of でんわを掛ける.
ご面倒をお掛けして申し訳ございません。 means "We are sorry for the inconvenience." but what is the meaning of 掛ける in this context
I was just sitting in a coffee shop, sheltering myself from the cloudburst over Tokyo a few minutes ago, and I couldn't help but overhear the conversation between to girls beside me.They were talking about mobile phones, apps, and were showing each other pictures on their phones.One of the girls said:SDカードに映{うつ}す映{うつ}す means to reflect, or project, and I'm only familiar with it in the sense of a film projector projecting an image on a screen. However, it seemed they were talking about copying pictures to their SD card.Is 映{うつ}す extended in use to mean copying data to a disk As in, the bits are reflected on the disk What are the nuances of 映{うつ}す that make it applicable hereIs this a recent usage of 映{うつ}す
"このテレビの直し方わかりますか。" means "Do you know how to fix this TV" but I can't figure out the purpose of の (after テレビ) in this sentence.
Near Shibuya, they're finishing up some construction on a subway system that has been going on for years. It seems they're at the stage of finishing up some road work above where they had been making subway.In the middle of Meiji Dori, where some of this construction remains, they had this sign:I understand all the words, and I think I understand the grammar, but I have no idea what it's trying to say. My translation is roughly:Work that remains on the map.What map And how can the work they are doing remain on it Why is this something you say on a sign for everyone to seeWhat does this sign mean

Good afternoon all,After a discussion, I was wondering is "今の" in "今のは誰？" considered a synthetic nounMy analysis of the sentence "今のは誰？" is:noun 今: just nowgenitive particle の (converts the noun 今 into an adjective to describe 人)noun 人: person (optional due to ellipsis)topic-marker は (optional due to ellipsis)(pro)noun だれ: whoFlaw's analysis of the same sentence "今のは誰？" is:noun 今の: just now that onetopic-marker は (optional due to ellipsis)(pro)noun だれ: whoFlaw's argument is that "今の" is a synthetic noun (it can be used anywhere where a noun can be used). Assuming that that holds true, it must mean that we can say "今のの[noun]" because "[noun]の[noun]" is surely grammatical.So basically, I was wondering Is 今のの[noun] considered grammaticalFor example, is "今のの状態" (phrase found here) considered grammatical
According to jmdict 曲がる is intransitive, therefore it should be used with が or は. However it always seems to be used with を - for example:この道を行って二つ目の角を右に曲がります。
In my JLPT textbook, it defines ～もさることながら as saying that the speaker feels one thing is true, and in addition another thing is true.One example they give which makes sense to me is:美{うつく}しさもさることながら、彼女{かのじょ}の魅力{みりょく}は何{なん}と言{い}ってもその人柄{ひとがら}にある。Here the speaker is saying that while the woman is beautiful, it goes without saying her personality is part of her charm. Note I'm not trying to make a perfect translation, just focusing on the essence of ～もさることながら.But there is this sentence in a test question in the book:舞台{ぶたい}のセットもさることながら、俳優陣{はいゆうじん}もこの上{うえ}なく豪華{ごうか}だ。I'm a little fuzzy on what this is trying to say, partly because 舞台{ぶたい}のセット is just a neutral thing. There's nothing inherently good or bad about it. Unlike, for example, 美{うつく}しさ, which is presumeably a good thing.To me, the sentence seems to be saying something like, "While it's true that's a stage set, the acting group is no more superior." I might be wrong about what 上{うえ}なく豪華{ごうか}だ means too, but partly that's because my confusion over ～もさることながら is giving me little context to build on.The point is, I don't see how a stage set can be said to be true or not true in any way that one can attach ～もさることながら to it.So I'm probably wroing about what ～もさることながら does. Does it imply a judgement Is the sentence in the question saying that the stage set is good
Recently, I forgot whether 鍵【かぎ】 meant lock or key, so I looked it up quickly on my phone's dictionary... And then I found out that it actually means both.What are the best ways to figure out if someone who is saying 鍵【かぎ】 is talking about a lock or talking about a key Is the intonation maybe different for each meaning Is there a way to ask which they are talking about Is there a common alternative word for one or both of themDefinitely not as important as the main question, but I'm also wondering if Japanese people sometimes get confused by this or if they just process it naturally since they're used to 鍵【かぎ】
Why is the あ-series in demonstratives irregular like the following:ここ　　そこ　　あ そこ　　　　　　どこ  　　　　　　　(expected あこ)  こう　　そう　　あ あ　　　　　　　どう  　　　　　　　(expected あう)Is it related to the fact that こ, そ, ど all end with the vowel "o", and あ ends with the vowel "a"
This sentence ending has started to creep up more and more in my current Japanese classes, and I'm still a bit unsure what all it can mean, how to use it, or even when I should think to use it. My Japanese teacher in a previous class mentioned that it can be used to "give emotion" to a statement or to inform the listener of new knowledge. Something along those lines. But I'd love a more formal explanation.What does it meanIs there a particular usage pattern to followWhat are some good examples of the various uses of this pattern, and how would they compare to the same sentences, only without んです
My JLPT textbook has a section about the use of んがため, which they define as "making an effort in order to realize the intended purpose."Which to me sounds like plain ol' ために.For example, they have this example sentence:祖父{そふ}は１００歳{さい}まで生{い}きんがために、食生活{しょくせいかつ}にはとても気{き}をつける。Isn't that the same as saying:祖父{そふ}は１００歳{さい}まで生{い}きるために、食生活{しょくせいかつ}にはとても気{き}をつける。...
My JLPT textbook has a section on the use of ～とばかりに. It explains that the term means to do something with such a strong implication that the meaning is obvious, even though one isn't directly stating the intended meaning.For one of the examples, it says:親子{おやこ}げんかをした時{とき}、父{ちち}は出{で}て行{い}けとばかりに玄関{げんかん}を指差{ゆびさ}した。This makes sense to me. The father is not actually saying, "get out,", but his action of pointing to the door so obviously implies it that his meaning is clear.However, there is this other example which confuses me:注文{ちゅうもん}した料理{りょうり}が来{く}ると、子どもたちは待{ま}ってましたとばかりに食{た}べ始{はじ}めた。This I don't get, because presumably the kids have actually waited for the food to arrive (unless the restaurant has quantum based instantaneous service...). So what purpose is とばかりに serving hereWhat exactly does とばかりに mean

Good afternoon all,From what I understand, there are two types of は-particle:The thematic-は (topic-marker) which is used to introduce things into the universe of discourse.The contrastive-は.jkerian states that:There can be only one thematic は in a sentence. If you see a second one, the second is certainly contrastive, and the first might be. (source)But Derek states that:The [non-first] は often adds a hint of comparison or contrast. (source)These two sentences are contradictory.Assuming that jkerian is right, that there is only one thematic は in a sentence, so the non-first は will always add a hint of comparison / contrast, which contradicts what Derek said.Assuming that Derek is right, that it is possible for the non-first は not to add any hints of contrast / comparison, then it suggests that we can now have more than one thematic は in a sentence, which contradicts what jkerian said.So basically I was wondering who is right Is it possible to have two は-particles in a sentence, both of them not having any comparative / contrastive hints
I see this all the time, but I don't know that I've heard it spoken.For example: インストール中Is it simply "なか"
Some languages, but not English, have regulators such as the Académie française (French Academy). Amongst other things, it decides whether or not English words such as email, software and ウォークマン ought to be in the French language, or should be replaced with French-derived terms like courriel, logiciel and baladeur.Wikipedia says the Agency for Cultural Affairs (文化庁) at the Ministry of Education of Japan (文部科学省) plays a role in language regulation. Previous questions have mentioned that the government has deprecated hentaigana and certain kanji. Does any other form of language regulation occur, either by the Japanese government, or organizations theoretically independent of it

I've recently been noticing some patterns which look like two repeated past-tense verbs, but I think which indicate a command rather than the past tense. For example:さあ、行った行った。  "Get along with you!"I also noticed in the Baseball manga "Major" the following, which was called over a loudspeaker:入った！入った！But I'm not sure what it means, or indeed if it is a command or baseball/sport-specific (it was at the start of the chapter and I'm missing the previous volume so I'm not 100% sure what the context is.)If both of the above are commands, are they roughly equivalent to さあ、行け and 入れ！ Is 行け！ more assertive than 行った行った！Can this pattern work with any verb, e.g. さあ、食べた食べた！ or is does it only work for a few
When I was playing a video game a few months ago, I noticed that some of the characters (mostly young teen females, in case it matters) kept saying ～すぎ instead of ～すぎる.For example, when one of the characters was being kind of rude, another character said to them:言いすぎ！ (You're saying too much!)I think I heard the exact same line from a young adult male in an anime too.Why was すぎ used instead of just すぎる When would it be better to use one or the other

I was asking a Japanese person for some help and noticed that I kept saying ありがとうございます over and over as they helped me more. Culturally, is it OK to keep saying it multiple times in Japanese Would it be better to switch to another word to express my gratefulnessI'm not trying to be English-centric, but I feel like continuously thanking someone might be a little odd or distant in English. I don't feel exactly the same way about it in Japanese, but I want to know what the Japanese perspective is on this.

I keep seeing examples of words where 物 is tacked on the end to mean "things." 食べ物, 飲み物, つまらない物, etc. Are there any restrictions as to what can precede 物 Can I, for example, say something like 青い物, 幸せ物, or even 死に物I guess 食べ物 is often translated into English as the noun "food", not "edible things." Is this merely a more natural translation or does 食べ物 literally imply "anything that can be eaten" (as opposed to "things that should be/are typically eaten")In French, there are seemingly highly-specific verbs like jaunir (to turn yellow) and bleuir (to turn blue). They act like they follow a similar pattern whereby any color can be transformed into a verb of this sort. (My French is very rusty, so please excuse me if this is an inaccurate assumption.) Does 物 perhaps have a similar flexibility whereby 「Ｘ物」 can always mean something like "things to Ｘ"

This question already has answers here:                                            How to say regrets [I should not have X]                                (2 answers)                            Closed 2 years ago.The following sentence was translated in the following ways:窓を開けたままで寝るんじゃなかった。  I shouldn't have slept with the window open.  I regret (that) I was sleeping with the window open.But why does ～んじゃなかった make the meaning "I shouldn't have slept" rather than "I hadn't been sleeping"
In Japanese, there is a potential form to express that it's possible for something to be done.My own examples of potential form:辛【から】い食【た】べ物【もの】が食【た】べられる。 (I can eat spicy foods.)ギターが弾【ひ】ける。　(I can play the guitar.)But I also know of 見【み】える and 聞【き】こえる. I've heard them used as also meaning it's possible for something to be done (seeing for 見【み】える and hearing for 聞【き】こえる). But this isn't the potential conjugation of the original words, 見【み】る and 聞【き】く. The potential form would be 見【み】られる and 聞【き】ける.What is the difference between the normal potential form and their "special" forms
I love katakana, mostly because of how the characters look. But I am constantly baffled by why certain loan words from English are constructed using certain katakana sounds.For example, if someone asked me to say "energy" in Japanese, I would have guessed エナジー or maybe エネルジー...but definitely not エネルギー. Same with "cake": ケーク sounds more natural than ケーキ. I understand that there are clearly many cases where there isn't an obvious "best fit" for certain words, but often it feels like some loan words pick the worst or least-likely sounds.Who or what decides what loan words will sound like Is there a governmental office that takes part in this Seemingly, since a lot of loan words are from English, a Japanese-English speaker would be able to best form a loan word.Am I reading too much into this :)EDIT: To be clear, I don't want to come across as, "How dare Japanese not try to perfectly pronounce loan words from my language!" It's more like, "Hm. I wonder why they say it this way when it's pretty easy to make a more accurate-sounding word."
I've seen some kanji whose furigana is actually katakana. For example, see the following manga cover for 桜蘭高校ホスト部. When would a kanji character ever be pronounced as a loan word
A certain character in an anime series I watch would literally end each sentence with なのね. What does this imply He was a pretty flamboyant character who was supposed to be Italian, if that offers any additional insight.
What is the most complex kanji (in terms of number of strokes), whether or not it's actually used often
I came across 婦 from this English-language Wikipedia article.Jisho.org says that 婦 (which contains 女 in it) can mean married woman, but it can mean woman or lady, and it then lists words such as 婦警 for policewoman and 婦長 for head nurse, ie roles where I assume her marital status isn't relevant.What differences, if any, exist between 婦 and 女, outside of the context of someone being married
I was listening to lastfm.jp the other day, and happened across this line in an artist bio:14歳の頃にギターを、17歳で作曲を始める。I've often read here on JLU that a phrase particle should only appear once per sentence for a given particle meaning. (Presumably this is more specific, and tied to the predicate verb)Is this substandard/casual Japanese more appropriate to mixi than a biographical snippetIs this an exception to that general rule/theme Are there any rules for how to put together a multiple を sentenceIs this simply an elliptical phrase joined to a complete sentence
In "何かしてみましょう。" meaning "Let's try/do something.", what is the literal translation of "してみましょう" I've got "して" means "doing" and "みましょう" means "let's watch or let's". How is "してみましょう" different from using "しましょう" Would using "してましょう" be grammatically correct and mean the same thing
In the book ロボット学論集 by 瀬名 秀明, I saw this sentence (not exact since I'm solely depending on my memory)2004 年公開の映画 "I, Robot" は，Isaac Asimov の同名の小説を換骨奪胎した別物である．I looked at several online dictionaries, all of which didn't seem to me that the expression doesn't have negative sense by definition. However this book makes me feel like the author implies negative sense. Can anyone show references that define the term more clearly regarding this aspect
It seems to me that より has virtually no meaning when used as shown below.Consider these:Please come before five O'clock:五時前に来てください五時より前に来てくださいPlease come after five O'clock:五時後に来てください (*ungrammatical as observed by sawa)五時より後に来てください(Question) What does より add to the sentence What additional nuance is there And why is omission of より acceptable for 五時前 but not 五時後
Just to add some context to this question: I graduated with a B.A. last June, and am currently taking a two-year break from education to work off some of the inordinate amount of debt I accumulated in my first four years.What's the best way to describe this type of situation in Japanese 休【やす】む 休憩【きゅうけい】 Something else entirelyYour help is much appreciated.Related: Is this the correct way of saying attending a school
The sentence トムは私より身長が高いです。 means "Tom is taller than I me." but I'm trying to find  the meaning of each word in order to understand the japanese sentence better. Here is what I have so far:トムは(Tom is topic), 私(I, me), より(less than or greater than), 身長が(height of body),  高いです(is tall).So I am having trouble making sense of how the words and particles relate to the sentence.
What is the etymology of the suffix()たがい in 仲たがい and how is it used to express discord If this is a suffix as such, is it used in combination with any other words
A fair while ago someone said something like 嘘だぴょーん！ in a comment.But what kind of a connotation and usage does ～だぴょん have Can it be used in a kind of humorous sort of wayEdit: Realized it was actually 嘘だぴょーん！.
Forgive me if this is a bit anecdotal, but I often hear a sentence pattern in speech which basically is of the form "[statement]...is what I would/want to say, but..." I usually hear this when the speaker is trying to lead the listener on as a joke or to be sarcastic. It sort of sounds like 「...て何と...」, but I can't be sure. There's a definite pause between the first expression and the て何-whatever I hear afterwards.EDIT: An example might be helpful. "You're really funny...is what I'd like to say." Possibly followed with an explanation: "You're really funny...is what I'd like to say, but I just can't lie."
I have the basic understanding that ね is generally more formal/feminine and な is generally more informal/masculine. I was told that you tend to use ね as an emphasis if you are a) a female yourself or b) are addressing a female, regardless of your gender.But say you were a male addressing a group of friends of both genders. Something like: ひさしぶり！Would you use な or ね at the end of the sentence for emphasis
I've often seen and heard the expression 〜と知る（知っている）.  When I think about it, it makes sense in the context of the quoatation-と, like with 〜と言う or 〜と思う.  It seems like it means "Know that 〜".ミユキちゃんが結婚したと知ってる？　→　Did you know that Mikyuki got marriedHowever, the few times I've tried to use it, I was told I was using it incorrectly, and that I should instead use 〜こと／のを知る.ミユキちゃんが結婚したこと／のを知ってる？So what are the rules for using 〜と知る  Do 〜と知る and 〜こと／のを知る have different meanings and rules (they seem the same to me)Update:  I've found quite a few examples from my Bible.  It's the 新共同訳 version, and I was able to search it here.  I searched for ～と知る, ～と知って, and ～と知った.  Here are a couple examples:「群衆は、イエスも弟子たちもそこにいないと知ると、自分たちもそれらの小舟に乗り、イエスを捜し求めてカファルナウムに来た。」　－　ヨハネによる福音書 / 6章 24節「けれども、人は律法【りっぽう】の実行ではなく、ただイエス・キリストへの信仰によって義とされると知って、わたしたちもキリスト・イエスを信じました」　－　ガラテヤの信徒への手紙 / 2章 16節「ヨナタンは言った。『そのような事は決してない。父があなたに危害を加える決心をしていると知ったら、必ずあなたに教えよう。』」　－　サムエル記上 / 20章 9節
I know that within an informal/familiar setting, people often leave out particles.  Whether or not this is grammatically correct I'm not positive, but for the sake of this question, I'll say that it's not.What I'm talking about are modified nouns without particles that seem to be grammatically correct.  Furthermore, I've never seen them with particles, and the particle-less form seems to be the only one.  Here are a few that seem to be accepted as particle-less ("accepted" meaning I've found these exact forms in at least one dictionary).父なる：　父なる神様　→　Father God / God the Father  聖なる：　聖なる人々　→　(a) holy people  単なる：　単なる過失　→　a simple/mere mistakeHere are some others that I've seen/heard before, but not sure if these forms are accepted as particle-less, or if they are just informally left out (could not find any of these exact forms in the dictionaries I have).息ある：　息あるもの　→　living things ("thing that are breathing")  影響ある：　影響ある政治家　→　an influential politician  力ある：　力ある人　→　a powerful/strong personMy question is, why are certain expressions like this accepted as not having particles  How did they become this way  Are there many expressions like these in additions to the ones I put  Is there some type of rule that governs when an expression can acceptably leave out the particleOr am I wrong about the whole thingUpdate:  some other examples I remembered:内なる：　内なる人　→　Our inner-self; the person we are on the inside  大【おお】いなる：　大いなる功績　→　a great achievement
What's the difference between 一応{いちおう} and とりあえずWhile I think they can both mean "tentatively" or "for the time being", there seems to be a difference in their usage. How do the two translate differently into EnglishAfter reading this Space ALC Japanese Q&amp;A page, I'm interpreting it as that 一応 has a negative nuance of something being "unsatisfactory" but temporally doing it anyway, and that とりあえず has a positive (or possibly neutral) nuance of "doing what you can do for the time being". Can the previous explanations work for all, or a majority of casesIt also states that in the following sentences there isn't a lot of difference between the two:お話は一応伺っておきましょう。とりあえずお話は伺っておきましょう。But I didn't understand why the two have a different position in the sentence. Would 一応お話は伺っておきましょう and お話はとりあえず伺っておきましょう also be possible
Good afternoon all,I was wondering is it true that "看護師" is a gender-neutral way of referring to a "nurse",Whereas "看護婦" implies that it is a girl,And "看護士" implies that it is a guyInitially that's what I'd thought, but WWWJDIC lists "看護士" as:看護士 【かんごし】 (n) nurse (may be male nurse)Hence I was abit confused with the actual usage of the words "看護師" and "看護士".What is the difference between "看護師" and "看護士"
Kana iteration marks are are rarely used today, and hence there is not much online information on it besides this Wikipedia article, which leaves me with a couple questions.Is there any kana that cannot be expressed with an iteration mark What about digraphs used in yōon, long vowels, or ん and ンCan a kana with handakuten such as ぷ be expressed with iteration marks Presumably, ぷゝ with an unvoiced mark would be equivalent to ぷふ, but what about ぷゞ with a voiced one Would it mean ぷぷ with handakuten or ぷぶ with dakutenHoping someone will be able to help me better understand these unique symbols!
Is [verb stem] + たかない different than [verb stem] + たくない What does it mean
I'm having trouble expressing the concept of "not often enough".  The most basic way to say "often" is よく, but I think there's a problem in putting qualifiers on this word.  For instance, expressing "more often" with もっとよく would be unnatural and/or wrong.Here are two examples from The Jim Breen dictionary for the word [頻]{ひん}[繁]{ぱん} that answer part of my question. This expresses a "more often" concept:メアリーは、もっと頻繁に母親を手伝うと約束した。  Mary promised her mother that she would help her more often. This is almost to the point of expressing a degree of frequency, but I feel like it comes up short for what I'm grasping for:できるだけ頻繁に辞書を引きなさい。  Refer to the dictionary as often as possible. How would you say "not often enough"  I'm tempted to try something like 頻繁さが足りない, but that has no Google results so it's probably wrong.  Would it be acceptable to use 頻度 instead  Let's say I wanted to say "I don't get updates often enough" or something like that.  What are the best ways to express this type of thought
Good afternoon all,From what I understand, "~ておく" basically has 4 meanings:to do something for a purpose / reasonused as a softener (source)to do.. for now or for the time being (source, source), in other words to leave a situation as it is for now or for some time (source)used as a request / command (source)I was wondering which of the above meaning is the implied meaning of "~ておく" when we use the word "任せておく" in the sentence "任せておけ！" Is it the first meaning: "Leave it to me! (and your reason being that I will get the job done for you)",Or is it the third meaning: "(For the time being,) Leave it to me!" PS: Btw just to confirm, is it true that the "~ておく" of "放っておく" implies the third meaning
In English we have a saying "window of opportunity" which means that there is specific time period where a certain event can occur. Based on that expression we talk about a "launch window" when it comes to rockets going into space and what-not. Due to weather or whatever other factors beyond human control, it is only possible to launch a rocket on certain days, or the "launch window". I was reading a Japanese news article on the "scientific rocket" that North Korea plans on launching (who's launch window opens today), and they use the phrase 「発射通報期間」. According to dictionaries this means "Firing/launching report period", but I imagine from the (very clear) context that this would be "launch window" in English. Now, while from the context of the article, I know the meaning, but my qeustion is if it is specific to talking about rockets and the like, or if something can be substituted to talk about, for example, a job offer (i.e. 求人通報期間). Is there a phrase, idiomatic or otherwise, to convey a "window of opportunity" As a secondary question, what exactly does 通{つう}報{ほう} mean in this context I mean, does it have a meaning other than "report; tip; bulletin; message"
I have just come across the phrase 知っての通り〜 (as you know...)I have never noticed this usage of て-form before and can't find an explanation.What is the difference (if any) between this and 知っている通りI have also seen 見ての通り used in a similar way.If possible please provide a more generalised explanation of the grammar at work here, and examples of other ways it may be used.
I've heard people say "So! So! So! So! So!" (or possibly "Sou! Sou! Sou!" or maybe using "z" instead of "s" - I'm bad at hearing) when laughing in agreement.When middle-aged women speak Japanese gives an example of this:Oishii! (Or any other word from the options supplied below.)So desu ne!So so so so so!So ka!NeNe![continues on - too long for this question]How is is spelt Is it the same as the そう that's used in そう です I tried searching for 然う然う然う然う然う (apparently 然う is a rarer, kanji form according to jisho.org) but couldn't find anything.
How does one write P.S. (post scriptum) in JapaneseDictionary translates postscript as 追伸, but is that the compound one would use at the end of a Japanese letter or e-mail
When people's names are listed with both sides aligned (either in horizontal or vertical writing), for example, in the ending scroll of a movie, there is a seemingly complicated rule (to me).When the length of the name (family plus given) is not three characters, the positioning is such that the characters are distributed evenly, without particular segmentation between the family and the given name parts:X* = family name, Y* = given nameX　　　　　　　　　　YX　　　Y　　　Y　　　YX　　　X　　　Y　　　YX　　　X　　　X　　　YX　　Y　　Y　　Y　　YX　　X　　Y　　Y　　YX　　X　　X　　Y　　YX　　X　　X　　X　　YHowever, when the length is three, it seems as if a space character is inserted between the family and the given parts and the positioning is done counting in the space character, like this:X　　　　　　　Y　　　YX　　　X　　　　　　　YConsidering the rules for the other cases, I would rather expect:X　　　　　Y　　　　　YX　　　　　X　　　　　YWhy is it like as is Is there a rule behind that makes the length-3 cases non-exceptional, or is there a reason why length-3 is exceptional, or, is it just due to inconsistency/stupidity of whomever started itEditOr to see it from the other side, it is natural that a space be inserted in between the family and the given names (as Dave points out in the comment). Then, why are the cases other than length-3 (except the length-2 case, which can be interpreted in either way) not having a space I would rather expect:X　　 　　Y　　Y　　YX　　X　　 　　Y　　YX　　X　　X　　 　　Yand so on.EditThese are links to some pictures that describe the situation (with some variations):picturepicturepicturepicturepicture
I would like to know if there are other ways to say "at least~" (context below), along with the relevant nuances of each way.This is for a piece of writing I'm doing where for the sake of style I want to avoid using the same phrase too many times. That said, please do include answers that may only be suitable for speech or conversation.I am referring to "at least~" as used in the following context:It looks like I won't be able to return to Japan for at least 6 months少なくとも６ヶ月の間日本に帰れないみたいです。(in other words I'm not looking for answers referring to phrases like せめて〜, which translates to a different meaning of the English phrase "at least")
Is there a Japanese idiom equivalent to "take with a grain of salt"In other words, an idiom which means "don't accept this information as completely true or the complete truth".
Good afternoon all,Sometimes I see that people like to "curl" the last mora of a verb, for example:瑞生: ああそれから、亜湖にも特別ボーナスだ。亜湖: えっ。瑞生: ジャーン！亜湖: 何それ？瑞生: かわいいだろう？瑞生: おいおいおい、ほら、ちょっと、当ててみろよ。亜湖: 何？瑞生: ほらほらほら…。瑞生: わあ、似合ってるぅ！(Youtube link)I was wondering what exactly does it mean to curl the "る" sound of the verb, and in what situations do we do that
Is it possible to refer to the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami and nuclear incident in everyday conversation, preferably without using the words earthquake or tsunami or nuclear incidentFor example, when I was told a museum in Sendai wasn't open, and I wasn't sure whether it was because of the earthquake or just because it's closed on a Tuesday, should I have said "大震災 / 東日本大震災 から"※, or could I have used something that doesn't directly mention 震災The reason I'm trying to do so is that even in English, people often avoid referring to the type of disaster when referring to it (eg "Bali", "seven seven"), and I've heard that the Japanese language tends to be more indirect than English.※ This may not be a correct use of the word から, but that's not relevant to the question.
I find it difficult to translate short software GUI instructional pieces like:Tap to enter commentPress here to talkSign in to continueShould I put it like:タップしてコメントを入力or must it be: ボタンをタップして、コメントを入力しますor コメントを入力するをタップします（してください）or something else
How do I learn which particles go with which transitive verbs since it is not always を。For example:ラップをかけるラップを被せる...is no problem, but...ラップで包む役に立てるJDICT says these are all transitive verbs but the last two examples don't take を so do you just learn them as exceptions or set phrases
I have two questions:What's the meaning of a phrase: 御用の向きとは Is it a set expression I found a few examples where it was ended with a question mark, in some cases preceded by addressing an interlocutor by his/her name. Is it always used that way Originally I found the phrase in a manga, it's said at the beginning of a new scene, so it's hard to provide the exact context. The situation looks like an audience, the speaker is saying the words to his host (and probably superior):「小太郎様、御用の向きとは、」After which the host speaks, offering him some wine. 2.What's the usage of うぬ in the meaning of "you" Is it an obsolete form Does it imply some difference of status between interlocutors
Is "flyjin" a Japanese wordIf so, does it have an antonymAnd what is the correct way to write it in Japanese Is it フライジン or フライ人{じん}For those who might be unfamiliar with the term, "flyjin" is a word derived from "gaijin" to describe foreigners who "flew away" from Japan after the earthquke, tsunami, and nuclear incident on March 11, 2011.
How to say X, let alone Y in JapaneseFor example, how would one translate:I don't know hiragana, let alone kanji.He couldn't boil water, let alone prepare a dinner for eight.I haven't enough time to look in the mirror, let alone go to see you.Would one use も どころか From Yahoo!辞書:赤ん坊は走るどころか歩くこともまだできない。The baby cannot walk yet, much less run.野鳥観察に出掛けたが，つぐみどころかすずめも見えなかった。I went bird watching, but I could not find even a sparrow, to say nothing of a thrush.Is that the appropriate grammar pattern
What is the difference between 悪い and だめThey're not really the same, but in English they both can be translated to "bad".あの人が悪い。In my limited experience, this is bad in the sense of evil.あの人がだめだ。This sounds more like hopeless, untrustworthy or unsuccessful. Like someone who will never succeed in life. Like a deadbeat.So, the question is can the above nuances be generalized to all uses of 悪い and だめ
I think that 知るかよ！ means "like I would know!"/"hell, if I know!" and that マジかよ！ means something like "[are you/is this] for real"/"seriously", but is there an underlying rule behind the ～かよ pattern seen at the end of sentencesIf I was to, for example, say （それを）食べるかよ, what kind of a meaning would it have Can ～かよ also be used as an ordinary question Does it make a rhetorical question
I've always been curious about the pronunciation of the す in です and at the end of 〜ます verbs. Most commonly the "u" sound is inaudible, but sometimes by some people it's more pronounced, and some people really go for it.Does it vary by age group, audience, gender, region etc in a way that I haven't picked up on Can anyone offer any particular guidance for people speaking Japanese as a foreign language
is there a difference in nuance or formality between ほとんど～ない, めったに～ない and まれ
This question came to me because I am writing a personal thank-you letter to a friend's family who hosted me in their home over the holidays.  What is the proper way to address the entire family  For example, in English, I would use "To the Ito Family".  Beyond this, it would be good to compile a list of typical Japanese openings and closings (salutations and valedictions) used in written correspondence.
I came across this example sentence for the grammar point ~にあって, which indicates that something is under a particular circumstance.彼女は戦争中、思想統制下にあってなお、自由な精神を持ち続けた。I understand the first and the last bits, but I cannot figure out the middle fragment 思想統制下にあってなお思{し}想{そう}統{とう}制{せい} means "thought censorship" according to my dictionary, but other than that I'm not sure what that exactly means. All I can think of is the Thought Police from Orwell's 1984...and I don't think that's it. (I hope so anyway.) I imagine that the 下 is read か, and I gather it means "under thought censorship", but that doesn't really help me understand the meaning. Is this something that is done particularly during wartime Does this refer to a specific practice or policy, and if so is it enforced, either by the government or some other group, or an individual  Is this more like political censorshipIf this is an internal circumstance (as in in one's mind), how can one have this censorship and retain a 自由な精神, or a "free mind" My last (and least pressing) question has to do with the use of なお with にあって...am I right in thinking that it means something more like "even under the circumstances (of thought censorship)..."All in all, this example sentence raised more questions then it answered...
I didn't find anywhere why is the minute's kanji there in 自分 Is it because a meaning of 分 is "part". Please clarify.
I often hear 春風【はるかぜ】(or, much less often, 春風【しゅんぷう】) used to describe the characteristically windy weather of early Spring.I was also certain I had heard it used on occasions as a figurative expression, to mean something akin to "Spring cleaning" or "Spring renewal".However, when I look in both bilingual or Japanese dictionaries, I cannot find any such additional definition.EDICT gives:春風 [はるかぜ]  (n) spring breeze春風 [しゅんぷう]  (n) spring breezeAnd Wikipedia:春風（はるかぜ）は、春に吹く風のこと。Did I dream this figurative meaning Is it merely understood and self-explanatory, but not widely accepted as part of the definition Has anybody ran into a non-meteorological use of the expression
I was watching the movie Mr. Baseball the other day.  Several times during the movie they talk about しゅうと which they describe as "the great equalizer".  (Could possibly be しゅうとう, but their dialog does not sound like they're elongating the last syllable).I've tried very unsuccessfully in finding this word in any of my multiple dictionaries.  Is this a common, known Japanese word  Is it some kind of 野球用語  Is it just 外来語 of "shoot", or some word from another language  If it's Japanese, does it have associated kanji
I've always been little fuzzy on transitive verbs, something which I was reminded of when looking at this answer.The answer says that 終{お}わらせる, 終{お}える, 済{す}ませる, and 済{す}ます are all transitive. They all mean "to finish" something, as in something doesn't finish by itself (intransitive), someone makes it finish (transitive).I get the nuance of difference between the kanji 終, 済 as explained in the answer.But what is the difference between 終{お}わらせる and 終{お}える And what is the difference between 済{す}ませる, and 済{す}ますI'm really asking more generally about the transitive verb form. Both versions of each verb are transitive, but I'm not clear on how they differentiate.(My knowledge of grammatical and linguistic terms is very limited, so a minimum of technical terms would be much appreciated. よろしく!)
I am working on the grammar pattern ～にはあたらない, which is used to indicate that something is not necessary. I.e, "No need to ask"　==&gt; 聞くにはあたらない.What I'm caught on is this example sentence:彼女が試験に合格したからといって驚くにはあたらない。It may be a subtle difference, but is this meaning closer to the English "There is no need to be surprised (that she passed the test)" or "It's not surprising (that she passed the test)"I ask because the former sounds almost condescending, while the latter seems praising.I'm sorry if this is too nit-picky, or it's simply a matter of poorly worded study material.
Good afternoon all,I was wondering when someone gives someone a ride (bicycle, car, etc), what's the difference in nuance between using the verb "乗せる" and the verb "乗っける"For example, I was wondering what's the difference in nuance/usage between these two sentences:でもその、自転車に乗せてくれた子に感謝しなくちゃね。でもその、自転車に乗っけてくれた子に感謝しなくちゃね。And these two sentences:入試の日に自転車に乗せてくれた子。入試の日に自転車に乗っけてくれた子。
Do viruses あります or いますCurrently, I'm under the impression that animals and humans use います (though see this question), while plants and inanimate objects use あります. Do viruses fall under the latter category
In "Japanese for Busy People I" page 2 (kana or romaji edition) it says that いいえ is 'virtually the same as "no"'.It sounds like there are some differences, but they want to omit mentioning them for the time being. What differences are there
雨が降りそうです雨が降るみたいですIs there any difference between the two Which one would be the most common way to say thisこのセーターは家で洗えそうですこのセーターは家で洗えるみたいですBoth these also seem valid, but imo the second one sounds a bit more awkward. Can I take away from this that ~そう is used for general impression and ~みたい for more visual impression
Good afternoon all,I was wondering when we chain particles, should "から" come before "だけ", or should it be the other way roundFor example, I'm expecting a mail from 健一, a mail from 健二, and a mail from 健三 (total 3 mails). However only the mail from 健二 arrived. Which sentence below should be used to describe the situation :健二からだけ(が)きた。健二だけから(が)きた。
According to Chocolate's comment to a question, some suru-nouns can be followed by the purposive に directly, but others require (the stem of) する in between.　面会しに行く  　面会に行く  　料理しに行く  × 料理に行く  Other examples that Chocolate gives are:　{観光/謝罪/調査/返却/回収/撮影/報告/面会}に{行く/来る}  × {雑談/読書/料理}に{行く/来る}When can a suru-noun be used directly before the purpose-に without (the stem of) する
Is there a name to describe the situation where a particular character is shown on a computer screen in a particular font, but this font does not have a glyph for this particular characterUsually, the result looks like this: □A kind of empty rectangle. Sometimes it shows the code for that character within the rectangle.How do yo call this phenomenon in JapaneseIf there is no name, is there a common term referring to this "missing glyph square" in Japanese(It is not 文字化け. 文字化け happens when character encoding meta-information is lost. It is not the problem here. Using a better font solves this phenomenon, but does not solve 文字化け. Selecting a character encoding solves 文字化け, but does not solve this phenomenon.)
おばあさん は 川（かわ） へ せんたく に でかけます。Why is there both へ and に When can they be used together Can someone break down the sentence for me to understand
むかし、 むかし、 ある ところ に おじいさん と おばあさん が いました。Here's what I got so far:(adv. time), (adv. time), (to be - infinitive) (somewhere) (ni particle), (old man) (to - conjunction) (old woman) (ga subject marker) (iru - polite past)Does the subject marker が always have to be there before a conjugated verb
I'm having a lot of trouble working out the difference between なんと and どう。 どう is "How" e.g. これはどう書きますか "How do you write this" and is easy for me to understand. The problem is なんと、the dictionaries translate it as "how" and "what".If I want to say "how" when do I use どう and when do I use なんと and What's the difference between これはなんと書きますか and これはどう書きますか。To put it in context, if it helps, I'm studying JLPT2 but still have problems with this.
I was asking if something is possible or not, and received the "ありじゃないかなぁ" answer below.I had never heard this expression, is my translation correctQ: 独習×ゲーム的なソーシャルウェブサイトは可能ですか？A: 聞いてみないとわからないけど、ありじゃないかなぁ。My translation of the answer: We have to ask to be sure, but I guess it is not possible.
Good afternoon all,From what I understand, special "suru" verbs only have one potential form which is formed using the syntax:[verb-stem] + [せる]For example, 愛す・愛する → 愛せる and 訳す・訳する → 訳せる. However, A Dictionary of Advanced Japanese Grammar claims that "熱する (ねっする)" and "察する (さっする)" conjugates in the same way as "する". Snippet:By that claim, it seems to mean that the potential form of "熱する" would be "熱できる (uh, ねっできる)" and the potential form of "訳する" would be "訳できる".WWWJDIC also has a chart which shows that the potential form of "訳する" is "訳しえる" and/or "訳しうる" (link).So now we have these potential forms:[verb-stem] + [せる] (e.g. 愛せる, 訳せる, 熱せる, 察せる)[verb-stem] + [しえる] (e.g. 愛しえる, 訳しえる, 熱しえる, 察しえる)[verb-stem] + [しうる] (e.g. 愛しうる, 訳しうる, 熱しうる, 察しうる)[verb-stem] + [できる] (e.g. 愛できる, 訳できる, 熱できる, 察できる)Are all of these 4 conjugations grammatically valid potential forms of special "suru" verbs
Good afternoon all,I understand that "X倍の" means "X times of", however sometimes I see the phrase "X倍もの" and I was wondering what it means.For example, in the sentence: 人間の脳には、約140億の神経細胞と、その10倍もの、神経細胞を支持する細胞があります。I was wondering what's the function of the "も" in "10倍もの" Or rather, what's the difference between the above sentence and this sentence (same sentence but omitting the "も"):人間の脳には、約140億の神経細胞と、その10倍の、神経細胞を支持する細胞があります。
I'm reading a manga and have run into a tricky phrase, so I am asking for help and some explanations:...遊ばにゃ損なってなもんだろうがおう！遊ばにゃ (or にや) - can't understand what the verb form is used here...損なって - "failing", that seems clearなもん - have no idea how to decipher this one...だろうがおう！"can do it" or "let's do it" and exclamation おう, depends on the previous context, as I understand
I hear often in anime and is translated as "but". And normally, it's at the beginning of the sentence. But I wonder if it used outside of the TV/movie world. For instance, きみ, I hear very often in anime, but I've been told it's not used in everyday speaking.
This question already has an answer here:                                            What does ～たまえ mean exactly and how do you use it                                (1 answer)                            Closed 5 years ago.While playing Final Fantasy 7, I came across the following text, which I think translates to something like:このせいせきでは、減給もありうると思ってくれたまえ  With these results, you can expect it likely there will also be a paycut!But I'm wondering, what does the ～たまえ mean in ～くれたまえ, ～与えたまえ and similar Does it add emphasis or change the meaning in any wayI looked in Daijirin and Daijisen's entry for まえ, but I don't think I saw anything there (unless I'm missing something.)
Our customer uses 箇所 but my manager uses 個所 when emailing project status. Are both kanji interchangeable The context of usage in a sentence is:一箇所変更しました。 A portion (of the code/software) was changed.
What does チャラ mean It was explained here that チャラ男 means light image. Does that mean cool image of a person A cool personチャラ男とは言動が軽いさまを表す「チャラチャラ」またはこれが形容詞化された「チャラい」を男性名っぽくしたものである（単に「チャラチャラした男」「チャラい男」の略ともいわれる）。Note: I was actually trying to understand an interview by いきものがかり here.
I've seen お疲れさま and ご[苦労]{くろう}さま used to say "Thank you" after some had done work of some type. After reading the お疲れさま thread, I realize that the two are not interchangeable. So when do you use ご[苦労]{くろう}さまWhen is it appropriate to use otsukaresama

I keep having するため（には） corrected to するには when writing sentences, but how interchangeable are they and when should each be usedTaking some Japanese sentences from Space ALC with my own English translations, is there some reason why one or the other is more natural/correct than the other in these examples for instance仕事で成功するには、家で、喜んで私を助けてくれる夫が必要なのです。In order to succeed at my job, at home, it's essential for there to be a husband who happily helps me out.花粉症を予防するために、眼鏡やマスクをして花粉から目や鼻を守ることが重要です。In order to prevent hay fever, it's essential to wear glasses and a mask, and protect one's eyes and nose from pollen.EDIT: Here's one example:日本語の言葉の背景色を灰色にするために、二つのグレイヴ・アクセント（``）を使う:Which was corrected to:日本語の単語の背景色を灰色にするには、二つのバッククォート（``）を使う:
I usually hear 早速ですが used as a phrase in the office. After looking on examples in the net,  it somehow mean "Well then" in English. Is the phrase just the same as "じゃ" or "では"For example:早速ですが始めましょう。じゃ、始めましょう。では、始めましょ。When do you use さっそくですが Are there certain instance when you use this phrase
I want to say I did something because of more than one reason. For example:I stayed home so I could study AND feed the dog.I'm not sure how to name the reasons in Japanese. How I'm trying to say it:Benkyoushite inu ni esa o yate kara ie ni imashita.Is it right Is there a better way to say it
Firstly, I apologise if this has been asked before or if I have asked this in the wrong place (should I have asked on the meta site).I've studied Japanese for (going on) 5 years, now. It's been mostly classroom based, but I gained a lot of experience and confidence when I travelled out to Japan (Fukuoka, Hirado, Sasebo and Nagasaki for those interested) that I don't think I'd ever have gotten in the classroom. But I've never studied the linguistic side of language study. By that, I mean terms like those found in the example provided in this question (over on meta).I really want to study Japanese and take it to the next level, and I'm left wondering whether it would be worth studying linguistics in an effort to further my knowledge or whether it would just be worth studying more vocabulary, grammar and such.I am very serious about my study of Japanese and it would definitely help in my current job, and I'm planning on visiting my Japanese friends again, soon. So, in the opinion of the fellow users/learners, would it be worth my time studying the field of linguistics What are the advantages and disadvantages of studying linguistics
When I go window shopping, the sales clerk would usually come near me asking what I like. How should I politely shoo them away Can I simply sayいいえ、けっこうですor something like 自分で見るI know I can just ignore them and they get the body language that I just want to look by my own. What is the common way to say itI usually feel awkward especially in electronic shops like yodobashi or yamada. For bookshops, they just leave you alone. I guess electronic shops' clerks are agressive.By the way, as a side question. Is there a word for "shoo" in Japanese I know Japanese are polite but do they have it
When using the phrase ほんの一瞬, I somehow feel compelled to insert だけ afterwards. This seems to be somewhat common (over one million hits for "ほんの一瞬だけ" on Google), but does it seem silly in terms of redundancy Since ほんの and だけ seem to have the same meaning, I'm not sure if I should actually say ほんの一瞬だけ, despite the Google results.
I sometimes see that English ka and ca are rendered キャ (kya) instead of カ (ka). Why is thisDo English ka and ca really sound more like kya than ka, at least to Japanese listeners (I know it doesn't to me.)
On Are 終わる and 済ませる synonyms, there were some questions whether 終わる is used as a transitive verb. Space ALC seems to have a few results for を終わる, but far more for を終わらせる and を終える. Looking at sense 4 of the Daijisen definition, it does seem 終わる can be used as a transitive verb:しまいにする。終える。「会議を―・ります」My question: How often is 終わる used as a transitive verb and when is it used in such a way compared to 終わらせる and 終える
I know that they both mean "finish". But I wonder if there are situations or contexts where you can use one but not the other.
Both mean 'various, all sorts of', but is there some subtle difference or not
[真]{ま}[逆]{ぎゃく} (not [真]{ま}[逆]{さか}, which is an interjection standardly used) is another 若者言葉, or an expression that is used mainly by young generation (with low education level) that makes me feel uncomfortable.逆 is a polarity notion; Something can be either the original (元), or the opposite (逆). There is no intermediate values like "half-way opposite", hence no room for quantitative/qualitative notions like genuine (真) or fake/quasi (偽) to come into play. I have no idea what meaning 真 is adding to 逆. How is 真逆 different from 逆 How would you justify the addition of 真 to 逆
Will someone please explain what this word いざ means  I've found several definitions, but I'm very unclear on what it really means and its usage.  I've heard it mostly in the following ways:～（は・なら）いざ知らず　→　"I don't know about ～, but ..."　→　This pattern makes sense to me, but it's about the only one.いざ尋常【じんじょう】に　→　I've heard this in the video game series Samurai Shodown (さむらいスピリツ).  The announcer says it before the fight, and it means something like "Fair and square".  EDIT:  The full pre-round announcement in the game is いざ尋常に...（一・二・三）本目...勝負【しょうぶ】！EDIT:  I also saw this on a Japanese friend's Facebook picture.  The caption said いざ新天地へ and the picture is of their child inside a cardboard moving box.  This seems to correspond to "After all this time, finally (we're moving!)" that @sawa posted below.Even though I understand the pattern ～（は・なら）いざ知らず, it would seem to still make sense even without the いざ in it.  It seems that いざ is some type of emphasis word or interjection.How do you use it  When can you use it  What types of words can you use it with
Is there any difference between the meanings or connotations of 記憶 and 思い出I started thinking about this after listening to the song 「タイムマシーン」 or "Time Machine" by 少女時代, where these two lines occur near the end of the song:儚【はかな】くて遠【とお】い記憶【きおく】になる前【まえ】に…二人【ふたり】の思【おも】い出【で】を忘【わす】れてしまう前【まえ】に…Is there any meaning behind using both of these instead of just being consistent and using one
On a specification about a data. The valid value must be multiples of 10 (10, 20, 30, ...) How do you state that in Japanese. I saw on a document that it is written asXは10,20,30・・のように10飛で付番するIs there other way to state this in Japanese

I'm lacking a range of vocabulary that allows me to express different kinds of pain. And since I'm on this theme I might as well included injuries in this question. It seems that everything can be contained in 痛み and きず but I would like to be more specific. I shall list down the different types of injury and its corresponding pain (Not the instantaneous pain felt at the moment of injury, but the pain that persists afterwards) that I think deserve a different description because they just feel too different from each other:Bruise; aching, tender(pain upon pressure)Cut/Gash; sharp pain, prickly sensationAbrasion; tingling/prickly sensationMuscle strain; dull and sore aching (Like after rigorous exercise the muscle feels sore)(For various injuries); Throbbing painWhat are their Japanese counterparts
How can one say "I am going to", express intention to do something in the future.

Please bear with me as I reveal my tenuous grasp on advanced grammar...While studying for the Grammar section of the JLPT (N1) I came across this grammar point to study: たるI came across a lot of confusion trying to sort out exactly what it means. Dispite the lack of solid explanations at my favorite haunts, I found out that for all intents and purposes there are two kinds of たる, one that is related to adjectives like what is discussed in this JLU question, and another that is appended to "a regular noun and modifying another noun", like how Akibare describes in this thread. It's the latter that will be tested on the JLPT.From tanos.co.uk:~たる意味：　Be~ ; As a~ ; is~接続：　[名]＋たる＋[名]例文：　教師たる者、学生に対して常に公平であるべきだ。My grammar study books says that it is used with 身分や職業を表す｢名詞｣.I thought I had it figured out, then I came across this sentence from a past test (1998):相手を十分納得させるにたるデータを示す必要がある。I believe it means "It is necessary that we have data that will sufficiently convince the other party." What I can't understand is how たる fits into it. Does ...納得させるに function as a noun If so, it doesn't seem to be referring to a noun that shows social position or occupation.Is this an example of the first usage of たる (which to be honest I don't really understand)
When wishing a woman a happy White Day, would I say ハッピーホワイトデー, or ホワイトデーおめでとう, or are both ok If both forms are used, do they have a slightly different nuance, such as "have fun on White Day today [said to a platonic friend]" versus "I in particular am wishing you a happy White Day [said to someone special]"
I know that there is no "The" particle in Japanese. But I am curious if there is a proper way to emphasize a topic the same way you do with "The" in English.For example:He's "the man".So you meet the "president"!!"The 2011" world championWould translate to "だ!" as in "です" How do you emphasize it in JapaneseOn the other hand how about translating book titles with "The" would be a different question too.
I just finished reading this paper, which describes the situations in which Japanese allows a dative subject and a nominative object. For example, the verb 分かる can be used like this:彼に英語が分かる"彼" is the subject but is marked with "に" instead of "が", and similarly "英語", the object, is marked irregularly with the nominative particle "が" instead of the usual "を". According to the paper, this happens in Japanese when a verb 1) licenses this case marking and 2) the verb is transitive (there is an object). There are two parts to my questions:1)The 可能形 licences dative subjects:「彼に英語が話せる」but not ｢彼に英語が話す」This is still ruled out for intransitives, so 5a in the paper shows that you cannot say 「*赤ちゃんにもう歩ける」. Does this change if we add another argument such as a location Can I say 「人間にはその道が歩けない」 (let's say it's covered in lava or something).2) The paper also mentions that there are exceptions to this rule, one of them being certain kinds of questions. Can anyone think of a Japanese question with a transitive verb or a verb that doesn't normally allow a dative subject, but which has a dative subject anyway
Is there a general meaning for 切る on the end of verbs I think it might have to do with "completely doing" something. If that's the case, how does ～切る on the end of verbs differ from ～てしまう, for example how do 成り切った and なってしまった "turned completely into" differ in meaningAdditionally:How does the meaning of 支え切れなくなる differ from 支えられなくなる "become unable to support" Can 支え切れなくなる mean "will go past the point of being able to support"How does 疲れ切った differ from 疲れた "exhausted" Does 完全に疲れた "completely exhausted" have a similar meaning to 疲れ切ったWhat is the relationship between 割り切る and 割る
I'm looking for a good way to tell someone that I want to inform them of something, but I don't actually need them to do anything for me. Something like "Just so you know, the printer is broken." As in, I'm not personally affected, but I thought the person in charge would want to be told. If I just say that it's broken, it sounds like a request to fix it so I can use it. I'm looking for the part that tells them not to worry about me personally.Some searching turned up "言っとくけど" but based on the example sentences　here, I'm not sure it means quite the same thing. Can anyone suggest an expression Thanks.
Recently I was introduced to the 四字熟語【よじじゅくご】:三寒四温【さんかんしおん】... to describe the type of changing weather one often experiences around late Winter/early Spring.As to the literal meaning of this expression (and where it came from):The 寒 and 温 in this expression are fairly obvious. For the 三 and 四, I automatically assumed a construction similar to the famous idiom: 七転び八起き【ななころびやおき】, where the "8" merely means "one more time than 7" and therefore something like "for every time you fall you get up, and then one".With that perspective, 三寒四温 would be (very roughly) something like: "for every time it gets cold, it gets warm again". At any rate: some idea of a back-and-forth (ending on warm).However, Wikipedia gives a completely different explanation:三寒四温（さんかんしおん）とは冬季に寒い日が三日ほど続くと、そのあと四日ほど温暖な日が続き、また寒くなるというように7日周期で寒暖が繰り返される現象。In their definition, the "3" and "4" correspond to somewhat specific durations, and together make a "one-week cycle" of cold and warm characteristic of the season.As much as I hate to question a Japanese Wikipedia page, this seems surprisingly specific and does not sound particularly grounded in any scientific or folk theory I have ever heard of. The reference links on the Wikipedia page are more illustrations than explanations and not helpful there.Has anybody ever heard of this expression and its possible origins Is there any substance to this "one-week cycle" of late Winter in older Japanese folklore
I sometimes have difficulty differentiating friend levels when explaining something to a Japanese person. For example, when I am telling a story about a friend, I want to specify the level of friendship we have based on the context of the story.So there are 4 commonly known levels of friendship (click here for those who are not familiar):AcquaintanceCasual friendClose friendIntimate friendOthers:Best friend (a little bit different from intimate friend)There are several terms I do hear when Japanese refer to friends like 友達, 友人, 親友, and 仲間{なかま} (translates as 'comrade' but commonly used to mean 'friend' in anime). How do I differentiate them in Japanese Or do Japanese not differentiate between them
I watch an animation called Detective Conan, which is about a detective. I read translations, but try to listen in Japanese. Sometimes, when he is asked "who are you", the main character answers by saying "探偵さ" (or is it "探偵さあ").In this case, what does さ meansThank you for your explanations.

I've read that The Tale of Genji, and similar Heian-era novels such as The Pillow Book, and The Gossamer Years were predominantly or exclusively hiragana, which is also called "women's writing" (女手).Was this because women weren't given the same level of education as men (as claimed by the English Wikipedia's hiragana article), and that Chinese characters (and possibly Chinese words) were seen as a masculine pursuit (as claimed by its article on The Tale of Genji)
When Japanese incorporates a Western word, especially English, often the spelling rather than the pronunciation is respected in the transcription, thus, ending up with a transcription that is not the closest possible within the limitation of Japanese phonology. And then, later on, on some occasions, (often young) people start to use a form that is closer to the original pronunciation, and there arise two forms. What examples can you think of for such casesExamplesMichaelマイケル (traditional)  マイコー(recent slang, especially referring to Michael Jackson)Volley ball  バレーボール (traditional)  バリボー (recent slang)  Peopleピープル (traditional)  ピーポー (recent slang, as in 一般ピーポー)Appleアップル (traditional)  アポー (recent slang, especially referring to Apple computer Inc.)  The following are examples of different forms both respecting the original pronunciation, and are not examples of what I am asking:Benjaminベンジャミン (as with the American president)  ベンヤミン (as with the German philosopher)
For example:人間の顔は左右対称ではないA person's face is asymmetrical.The above is simple, but how about:漢字の形が左右対称である。"The shape of the Kanji character is symmetrical."The problem I have with the above sentence is "symmetrical" and "左右対称" have different meanings, "symmetrical" is similar to "proportional" whereas "左右対称" has the meaning that if you "flip it over" the shape doesn't change (i.e.金、田、山, etc.). I was thinking "mirror-image", but usually you are contrasting one thing to another.Any suggestions on how to express the meaning 左右対称 in English correctly in the above sentence
Okay, so I'm confused about passive verbs. From how I understand it, the verb is performed on the subject.but how come you can say something like明日の会議に行かれるんですか？Are you going to tomorrow's meetingwhy not something along the lines of:明日の会議に行きませんか？so as far as I can tell, "go" (行かれる) is not performed on the subject, you (implied). Could someone explain how this works in this sentence
I am working on Japanese texts describing Buddhist temples in South-East Asia and there is quite a number of words I can't really translate in English. Here is a list with my tentative translations (I wrote a ~ next to the words whose meaning I am really unsure of):結界石{けっかいせき} (~): rules tablet/barrier stones布薩堂{ふさつどう}　(~): confession hall講堂{こうどう}: auditoriumサーラー さぁらぁ(~): open pavillion僧坊{そうぼう}: monk cell鼓楼{ころう}: drum tower三蔵庫{さんぞうく}: library仏教{さんぞう}教育{きょういく}学校{がっこう}: buddhist school普通{ふつう}教育{きょういく}学校{がっこう}: regular school火葬場{かそうば}: funeral hall仏塔{ぶっとう}式納{しきのう}骨塔{こつとう}: bone keep in pagoda壁式{かべしき}納骨所{のうこつば}: bone keep in wall瞑想場{めいそうば}: meditation hall洞窟{どうくつない}内仏{ぶつ}像祭壇{ぞうさいだん}: altar in cave精霊祠{しょうりょうし}: guardian spirit house碑文{ひぶん}: epitaph/scripturesDoes this look fine
I was trying to think of a way to say "I'm trying hard to read a news article every day" (in the sense that I'm trying to find the time to sit down and pay attention long enough to read, not necessarily that the material is very difficult).What I came up with off the top of my head was an awkward-sounding construction of 毎日、ニュース記事ひとつを読んで頑張っている, but that sounds both a little strange to me, and also like it's difficult for me to read the material. (Of course, I'm not a native speaker so I can't say 100%...maybe it just sounds wrong, full stop.)  I'm not proficient at reasoning out how grammar works (or should work) in my head, but as far as I can tell, in the phrase 勉強頑張る 「勉強」 is a noun, so I was wondering if it wasn't something like 読むの頑張る, but that sounds odd and received no Google hits.I feel like 頑張る should be used, because it's such a great word, but I could be wrong.My searches have turned up vague results and cultural essays.Please note! I am much less interested in translating the phrase I mentioned above and much more interested in learning how to say things like:"I'm working hard at doing X every day."or"I'm really trying to do X regularly."
How are sentences like 日本がピンチだ (Japan is in a pinch) and 明日は雨だ (tomorrow it will rain) analyzedTranslating them trivially, as日本がピンチだ Japan is a pinch  明日は雨だ Tomorrow is raindoesn't make sense. So something must be going on. Is it日本 and 明日are topics, not subjectsThis would only make sense if が is interpreted as a topic marker, which would be an expansion from its usual interpretation: a subject marker. "This wouldn't be a problem for the second example" you might say, but e.g. subordinate clause 明日が雨だったら is valid, and has the same problem.ピンチ and 雨 are の-adjectivesピンチの国　→　日本がピンチだ  雨の日　→　明日は雨だLoose/alternate interpretation of copulaYou might argue that the Japanese copula doesn't equate things to the same degree as the English one, but merely associates them. This might seem the most straightforward explanation, but looking at the wikipedia article on copula, such interpretations are not mentioned.Something else

I noticed that in various works of Japanese art, the artists sign their work with a seal whose contents range from fairly regular kanji to very abstract variations of kanji. I have also seen it used in calligraphy, as shown in the example below.I heard that this is called "seal script", but no one has been able to point me to any more information on it beyond Wikipedia. Is there a name for this form of writing and better resources for learning about it
In Happy Feet 2, I noticed that the penguins used the hitori, futari, ... counter words for themselves, rather than 羽.In fiction involving talking animals where the humans are regarded as somewhat "outsider", what counter word do they use for humans Do they still use hitori, futari, ..., or would they use something else such as 頭 (if a penguin were speaking) or 匹 (if a shark was)
が早{はや}いか and や否{いな}や both seem to mean "as soon as". They describe a relation between two actions, where one action occurs when another does.I'm a little fuzzy on the difference, though. I think, from reading examples in my N1 practise book that が早{はや}いか is more momentary. Action A is something that is more or less instantaneous, triggering B to happen in a mere moment.や否{いな}や, on the other hand, can be a little more overlapping. While action A is in the process of completing, B happens.Here are some example sentences which seem to support that difference:時計{とけい}が10時{じ}を告{つ}げるが早いか、いっせいに問{と}い合{あ}わせの電話{でんわ}が鳴{な}り出{だ}した。The clock hitting ten is an instantaneous occurrence.母{はは}の足音{あしおと}が聞{き}こえるや否{いな}や、愛犬{いあけん}のチロは玄関{げんかん}までダッシュした。Footsteps continue over a small amount of time, so there is a bit of overlap between them being heard by the dog, and it running toward the front door.However, this example sentence doesn't fit the mould:電車{でんしゃ}のドアが開{ひら}くや否{いな}や、どっと乗客{じょうかきゃく}が降{お}りてきた。A train door opening, to me, seems more of an instantaneous occurrence than not. Though maybe that's just my take on it. I could see how some might argue that it is a point in time more than a section of time.Am I correct in that they a differentiated by how instantaneous event A is Is there anything else that differentiates them
I know that その通り can mean "Exactly" or "That's right". But I was watching an anime (Samurai 7) and heard one of the characters say "この通り" and something else right afterwards which I didn't catch.For context, the scene was the governor of the city asking for forgiveness from some samurai who had been wronged by his predecessor. After he admitted that the samurai had been wronged. He prostrated himself and said, "この通り (and something else)". The subtitles translated to: "I beg of you. Please forgive me."
It's from the Japanese saying, 読書百遍意自ずから通ず(Repeated reading makes the meaning clear). In this case, the ず ending doesn't make the verb negative. What is the function and nuance of this usage Is this a verb form from the old days reserved for use in Japanese proverbs and perhaps some other specific and narrowly defined instances Another example where this is used in the same way is 窮すれば通ず [きゅうすればつうず] (Necessity is the mother of invention). Is there another example with another verb that uses the ず ending in the same way
I had my sentence of 今日は友達の車で警告を読んで、和英翻訳してみることにします ("Today I will read the warning in my friend's car and try to do a Japanese to English translation of it")  corrected to become:今日は友達の車の中で読んだ警告というところを和英翻訳してみることにします.Specifically, I am unable to understand this portion: というところ.These are the only forms I know:Verbところ - is just about to do [verb]Verbているところ - in the midst of doing [verb]Verb-Pastところ - had just done [verb]Verbていたところ - has been doing [verb]Eventところを - in the midst of [Event]読んだ警告という does not fall within the above analyses. It is a noun modified by a relative clause. What does ところ do in this case
Warning! This question contains at least one, possibly, derogatory word. I appologise if readers are offended.A friend of mine asked me to translate a passage from a poem in British English into Japanese, and I'm having a little trouble with slang and phrases used in it, particularly the words Dyke and Femme. I asked the friend I'm translating it for, and she confirmed that these words are used in the following contextual meaning:Dyke "masculine lesbian"  Femme "feminine lesbian"Are there any specific words or phrases that I can use to convey the contextual meaning of these words in my translation I'm aiming for informal Japanese in my translation. I figured that it would be easier to translate from informal English into informal Japanese. Plus, I doubt that there are any formal derogatory terms for the words I'm stuck on.I'm using Oxford Japanese-English Dictionary and the dictionary built into JWP-ce. I realise that some words and phrases are difficult to translate from one language to another, and I also realise that some things aren't going to translate at all.
I read a sentence in Naruto that challenged some of my ideas about how Japanese works, and I'd like to try and clear this up. I can only assume that アナタがピンチの時 means "when you're in a pinch".First of all, it looks like a relative clause modifying 時, but why isn't there a verb Usually, when something is marked with が, that thing is the subject (or something) of a particular verb. Here, there's a verbless subject. Is the copula impliedSecondly, could you say アナタがピンチな時 instead How is な used in relative clauses
I am trying to name a library on a group of forms. The specification names the group 諸元管理画面.I tried to search and the dictionary says it means "various factors or elements".But on other examples is says 諸元表 means specification sheet. Any ideas what 諸元 means

I came across this phrase in a book:緑なす半島Obviously (and also confirmed by Weblio) it is describing a quality of the peninsula, but I'm curious as to what exactly it means, and how/when it can be used.I found a forum discussion on its use as compared to なる, but it doesn't seem to me to be used in the same way as where I found it. (It generally concluded that is was a transitive version of なる...which I can't say is wrong, but I don't think I really understood what they were trying to say, and I think it requires a particle {を} in order to be used like that.)
This recent question brought to mind a question of my own.The Japanese name for the Twenty-One Demands made by Japan in 1915 to the Republic of China is romanised on the wikipedia page as 対華二十一ヵ条要求 (Taika Nijūichikkajō Yōkyū).How is the combination 一ヵ条 meant to be pronounced If the wikipedia page is correct, what explains the gemination between 一 and 条
I encountered the following on our daily reading.どのような企業{きぎょう}も、創業期{そうぎょうき}には全社員が昼食をとること さえ 忘れてしまうほど、忙しくフル回転していたものです。In a business, a person was so busy that he forgot to eat lunch even lunch. (Not sure if translation is correct.)From what my friend explained, the さえ means "even" or similar to ほど. Using a similar sentence he explained that さえ was only.私はお酒 さえ あれば、幸せです。Even if I have I only have sake, I am happy.How is さえ used I think it is synonymous to ほど.
What is the correct pronunciation for 1カ所 It means: 1 placeContext:ユーティリティ関数として定義されているわりには1カ所からしか呼ばれていない。It is defined as a utility function, but only called in one place.
たたき台 means a springboard for discussion.According to my dictionary, this word's first meaning is "chopping block".On Google Images, it does not look like the plastic/wood board I use to cut meat/vegetables:So what is the non-abstract meaning of たたき台ALC does not have it.
Where did とんでもない (meaning "not at all" or "outrageous!") come from Could it be 飛んでもない ("will not even jump/fly" in a similar way how "When pigs fly" is considered a remark for something outrageous) Or is there a more complete sentence from which とんでもない was taken out
I ocasionally hear sentences such as髪が長くなりたい I want long hair  心が美しくありたい I want to have a beautiful heartAlthough I might use similar constructions myself, I do not consider them fully correct because they sound like "(My/the) hair wants to become long" and "(My/the) heart wants to become beautiful". I am aware of Japanese "double-subject" sentences (although I don't agree with this term) and understand that these can be considered ～たい forms of them:(私は)髪が長くなる　→　髪が長くなりたい  (私は)心が美しい　→　心が美しくありたいbut would prefer to rewrite to other forms:長い髪が欲しい  美しい心の持ち主でありたいNow my question is:Are the first sentences I posted considered fully correct forms, or do others consider them slightly marked as well I tried to google for some grammatic prescription related to this, but found it hard to know what to google for.Edit after seeing answers:So if 私は鼻が高くなりたい is grammatical, what is the common way to analyze this sentence Obviously, translating 高くなりたい as "want(s) to become high" doesn't work, since "I" is not the one wanting to become tall, and "nose" doesn't have a will of its own.Is it that ～くなりたい operates on a phrase level, i.e.私は(鼻が高)い I am tall-nosed  私は(鼻が高)くなりたい I want to be tall-nosed,or is there another way to analyze this
心がいつも美しくありたいです    I want my heart to always be beautiful.心がいつも美しくして欲しいです (Incorrect)心がいつも美しくなりたいですI want my heart to always be beautiful.()My Japanese friend wrote the first sentence, while I wrote it over attempting to use 欲しい instead. I am unfamiliar with this use of ある, and have a few questions about it. Is it derived from the same "existence" verb, ある -- 在る   My other question is how personal is the nuance when expressing a wish or desire, compared to 欲しい If the second version that I wrote with 欲しい is acceptable, how do the two sentences differ in tone, politeness, meaning and expression I am wondering if ありたい expresses a more, or less personal desire than 欲しい. Furthermore, can one rewrite the original sentence using another verb, while retaining the same meaning Lastly, is my translation correct Or should it read "I want my heart to always be beautiful." I had thought that the original sentence corresponded to something like "I always want the person on the inside to be beautiful (just like how I am on the outside)," but maybe I am wrong.Thank you.
For example, やらなければならない can modify 時 to form やらなければならない時 and I know that the adjective い ending can simply have a noun appended after it. However when it's contracted to やらなきゃ can I simply add a noun after it and pretend that the ない ending still exists even though it has been contracted and elided Will it still maintain the meaning of "(The) time where you must act" or will なきゃ be forced to take on the meaning of "unless" as in a similar manner reflected in the answer to Difference between ~なきゃ　and ~なくちゃ

I'm familiar with the て and てください forms of a verb to give a command/request and request, respectively. However, I've run across these other forms and really don't know which to use in what situation. I'll just list all the ones I've run across.止めて下さい 　　　止めてくれ         止めて 　　　止めなさい              止めとけ                止めろI believe the first is the most polite and last is the most rude. The others in the middle are a guess. However, when and where to use these forms are a mystery to me. Note: I'm focused on the endings not the verb itself. Also, if I've missed any, please feel free to add to my list.
Why was "wani" (crocodile or alligator) chosen as a term for a gawker at a konyoku (mixed gender onsen)Was it because of the animal's ability to stare, the fact that it is a predator, or was it named after a similarly named onsen
In one song (lyrics link) the line "Watashitachi no kore ga precious heartbeat" ("It's our precious heartbeat") appears, and I'm not sure how best to analyze it due to one particular grammatical structure. "kore ga precious heartbeat" is clearly a straightforward verbless copula - "it's our precious heartbeat". What I'm unsure of is how to syntactically interpret "watashitachi no" ("our"). Thus far my best guess is that it's a wa-less topic. A more straightforward interpretation would be "this of ours". But is this even plausible I tried searching on WWWJDIC for "no kore" and found only 3 examples, and all three of them could plausibly be explained as something other than that. So at this point I don't have any evidence that that's possible. Is there some structure in Japanese where "watashitachi no kore" could be a phrase - and if so, what is the structure in question
日本人には、見知らぬ人と会話を始めてまだくつろいだ気分にならないうちに、相手の、年齢や地位、既婚か未婚かなどの個人的な事柄を知りたがる傾向がある。There is a tendency for Japanese to want to know a certain amount of personal information about someone such as age, position and whether they are married or not, before they feel comfortable talking with a stranger.In this example, what does the うち in ならないうちに mean On a side note, I sometimes notice that Japanese punctuation differs from English usage. Why would the writer put a comma after 相手の
While chatting with a friend about meeting up in eastern Tokyo, I typed in ひがしとうきょう and my Mac dutifully sent 東東京 out the wire. I quickly clarified with ひがし東京 just so she wouldn't think I had made a weird typo or something.But is 東東京 actually the correct way to write "eastern Tokyo," or is there a less ambiguous way to do so Is there a uniform way to refer to directions inside of place names which feature directional kanji - could the same rule apply to "northern Hokkaido" and so on
Why is the あ-series in demonstratives irregular like the following:ここ　　そこ　　あ そこ　　　　　　どこ  　　　　　　　(expected あこ)  こう　　そう　　あ あ　　　　　　　どう  　　　　　　　(expected あう)Is it related to the fact that こ, そ, ど all end with the vowel "o", and あ ends with the vowel "a"
It means "as one would expect" when referring to others, and it's sort of a compliment.But you're not supposed to compliment yourself in Japanese.So does さすが have a different meaning when referring to oneselfExample: さすがに眠い
In pool/billiards, "to rack" means to set up the game by placing the balls into the triangle frame. What is the corresponding (technical) term in Japanese if any I came up (via circumlocution) with:ビリヤードの球を三角形の枠に並べるIs there a better way to express this Alternatively I suppose 準備 and its synonyms would work to describe "preparing the game for play". But it's not specific to pool/billiards.

Why is 味わわせる often pronounced as 味あわせる What makes the former form unnatural, and what is the mechanism that changes it to the latter form In the first place, what it the -waw- attached to aji (besides the obvious answer that it is an affix that derives a verb) Are there other words (inside or outside of Japanese) that follow the same phonological pattern

I just read a sentence in an answer key as follows:雨が降ったら、買い物をしたり、おいしい物を食べるつもりです。I would have thought that the sentence should be:雨が降ったら、買い物をしたり、おいしい物を食べたりするつもりです。Is there any difference between the two Is it alway ok to not finish off with たりする Although it changes the meaning of the sentence, would it also have been ok to finish off with just 食べます
This question already has answers here:                                            Closed 8 years ago.Possible Duplicate:Is じゃないです equally correct as じゃありません Both have the same meaning ("did not come") and according to my Japanese co-workers both are acceptable while they can't define the difference.What is the (possibly obscure) difference in meaning between these two sentences
I want to say "it's different enough to make a difference," but I'm struggling a bit to get there. Partly because the two uses of "different" in this sentence are doing two different jobs. The first one refers to the relative difference between two things being compared, the second one refers to an absolute amount of difference that would be appreciated by anyone looking at the given situation.So, for example, I might want to say "the pronunciation of bun and ban are different enough to make a difference." Here I'm saying that the relative difference between the way the two words are said is small, especially to Japanese who pronounce both as バン. However, the absolute difference is significant in that they mean completely different things.The key concept is that there is a threshold of difference, "just enough", that has been achieved which causes the significance to just barely pass over from something that doesn't matter to something that does.How would I say this in Japanese Here are my (probably wrong) guesses:bunとbanの発音{はつおん}違{ちが}いは十分{じゅうぶん}違{ちが}う？bunとbanの発音{はつおん}の違{ちが}いは違{ちが}う過{す}ぎる？(I'm not sure if there should be a の in there after 発音{はつおん}, so I'm trying it both ways.)

Does anybody know of a standard term to describe Japanese and Western name orders (for example, when filling a form):John Somelastname ← "Western name order"Somelastname John ← "Japanese name order"Short of an exact term for each form, what construct would you use if you had to tell somebody to use one instead of the other or tell someone which one is which, in a document where both would be present.To clarify: I am not asking how to say "write first name, followed by last name" or some such step-by-step instruction, but a self-contained descriptive term for the forms themselves.

「自慢げに話す」「得意げに話す」「誇らしげに話す」Is this げ a simple way to turn adjectives and nouns into adverbs(are the first two examples nouns turned into adverbs, or were they adjectives as well to begin with)
From what I understand, they both mean "is not". But from what I've been able to gather from the few times I've heard it, it seems that あるまい may not be as strong or definitive as ありません. Am I on the right track here Also, can まい be used with any verb ex: 飲むまい or just with ある
I found these two sentences which seem to me to be quite similar in the translation but are constructed in a different way:魚を食べる ぐらいなら 飢えたほうがましだ  'I rather starve than eat fish.'恥 よりも 死ぬほうがましだ。  'To die is better than to be in shame.'Can anybody explain about the difference Sorry, my English isn't that good; maybe the translation of the sentences is bit poor.
I was conversing with my Japanese colleague:Me: Do you know how much a melon costs in my home country     Colleague: I do not know.     Me: Take a guess.  I asked him how to say take a guess. He first told me to use 推測{すいそく}してみる, but later retracted and told me to use あててみる. Which one is more natural in day to day conversation
I'm about halfway through Genki II, and the particles are starting to mess with me like never before. In particular を, が and に.I know the general principles like が and に making a subject or indirect object, を making a direct object, に being used for "direction" etc. But this somehow doesn't seem to help me a lot of the time. I mean I often make the right guess, but that's just what it is, a guess. And I suppose that's what's bothering me.For one, with some verbs it's simply unclear to me what to use. 飲む is obvious, but 卒業する I'm not going to fetch my book, but I'm guessing に since I believe it means "to graduate from". Is this the best way to think of it It's all a bit of a pain when words like 働く/務める comes into play, but I guess no one said it should be easy..Secondly, it gets very confusing when different constructs change the particles. In particular は/が. I never thought you'd use は in a quote, but apparently that's entirely OK. And then there's the act of doing something for someone else, or getting something done for yourself, which does mess with these particles.Long story short, is there an easy way to learn when to use what particles Right now, it only seems to get more confusing the deeper into the language I get.
I am usually confused if I am going to use 入れます or 付けます when specifying that I attached something to the email.For example:最新の帳票サンプルを添付して入れます。or最新の帳票サンプルを添付して付けます。I would usually say that I am usually trying to say that the assigned task is finished the finished output is attached to the mail. Is it more natural to say 付け (attached) or 入れ (in the mail)
I don't think us getting together tonight is such a good idea.やっぱり今夜、よりを戻すのは止めておこう。I would like to understand this sentence better, specifically the (idiomatic) expression, "よりを戻す." I will parse the parts I am not sure of below to see if I grasp it correctly:"やっぱり"  "after all.""よりを戻す" is an idiom() meaning "get back together.""止めておこう"  "Should let pass/should let the matter drop/let's quit"If these are acceptable, how does "よりを戻す" express "get back together"And does the おこう in "止めておこう" derive from 置く
I was reading the wikipedia page on "predicate," where it mentioned that in Japanese,  the negative form of a verb is an adjective. I thought that this was too expansive a statement to be true, but what does the writer mean Does the writer mean that only verbs in the ない form of the negative are adjectives Is this still too broad in meaning to be true
I saw this as a comment on this question, Why does そう in 「美味しいそう」 not mean "seem" the way I think it should「美味しいそう」-not-mean-seem-the-way-i-think-it-should,and would love to understand the differences.I am sure I will mangle the translation, so forgive me.食べたそうだ  Looks like he ate it. 食べそうだ  Looks like he will eat it.静かだそうだ I heard that it's quiet.静かそうだ  Seems quiet.If anyone would be kind enough to explain the differences in meaning and usage, I would greatly appreciate it. I didn't learn how to embed the quoted question, so sorry again for that.
What does the sentencing ending particle ですよ become in Kansai-ben
I was listening to a song Disney's Hunchback of Notre Dame in Japanese (the intro, The Bells of Notre Dame or ノートルダムの鐘), and I noticed that they referred to the cathedral as a 「てら」. I thought that was odd since as far as I know お寺 is used to refer to a (specifically) Buddhist temple and the Notre Dame is a Catholic building. The Wikipedia page on the Notre Dame refers to it as both a 大聖堂{たいせいどう}and a 寺院{じいん}. (Of course, the latter uses the kanji 寺, but it doesn't seem to me to carry the implication of a specifically Buddhist temple, and at any rate does not share a reading with it.)Is there any precedence for calling a cathedral a 寺, or was this used for a certain effect (perhaps to make the imposing look of the building a little more familiar to a Japanese audience...to be honest, it can be kind of scary looking) Is it possible it was used because it's a shorter word and fit into the song better　I'd love to watch the movie entirely in Japanese to see if they continued calling it such, but alas I don't have it.
For instance, you can ask someone: Did you go to the store todayor You went to the store todayWould those both be translated as: 今日、乾物屋{かんぶつや}に行ったか？Or is there another way to express did + VerbNote: how do you do furigana + kanji on this board
これが私の手紙に対する彼の返事だ。  This is his answer to my letter.自分の中の彼に対する気持ちをどう表現していいのか分からないの。I don’t know how to express how I really feel to him.彼に対して、彼を好きという私の気持ちを、どう表せばいいか、わからない。 I don't know how to express to him that I like him.Often when I run into  対する in colloquial sentences like these, its meaning appears somewhat extraneous. It seems to emphasize the direction of the action in an obvious way. I am tempted (mistakenly) to think that in these kind of sentences, the meaning expressed could be sufficiently communicated with just に. Is  対する just adding extra emphasis, or I am I misunderstanding some of its meaning or grammatical purpose How does it add to what is being communicated Does it add a measure of gravity to the statementFor instance, if I was to remove the 対する, would these sentences become grammatically incorrect, or would the meaning drastically change Perhaps they just start to sound unnatural or poorly constructed...If you see any mistakes in translation feel free to point them out. Thank you.これが私の手紙に彼の返事だ。自分の中の彼に気持ちをどう表現していいのか分からないの。彼に、彼を好きという私の気持ちを、どう表せばいいか、わからない。
I heard that it means something like "to get stuck with something."Can you explain what this means and give some examples
When stating two things e.g. A and B , and not counting the possibility of "neither", there exists A, B and A and B. To express all of them at once, "and/or" is commonly used. What are the ways to express this in Japanese I came up with 両方またはどちらか一方 but I feel it's a little bit unwieldy. Is there a shorter or better way to express this
When referring to the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear incident, is "3.11" pronounced "San gatsu ju ichi nichi", or is there a shortened version, like "nine one one" or "September eleven" for the terrorist attacks on September the eleventh
I learned from Nihongoresources that:An interesting note is on the "number of problems" I mentioned; while in English you would list problems (or rules, or whatever) as "First, ....., second, ......, third, ....." - Not so in Japanese. Instead, you list each individual problem, rule, or whateveryagots [sic] with ひとつ. The reasoning here is that you are not listing them in an ordered fashion, ticking them off, but you're listing them one by one, and each thing you list is only one thing, therefore you count them as one thing, not two or three or more.But I encountered this description on a box of おせんべい:一つ、一口に海老コク広がる姫ゆかり。 (Bite-sized shrimp (コク広がる姫ゆかり   stretched princess-ness))二つ、磯の香りをくるりと黒のり。 (Wrapped with black seaweed and flavor of the sea)三つ、目にも美味しい桜えび青のり。 (Sakura shrimp in green seaweed that's delicious even to the eyes)四つ、パリッと姿焼きかわいい小えび。 (Crispy grilled cute small shrimp)五つ、香りと風味はじける黒ごま。 (Black sesame that's bursting with flavor and fragrance)六つ、上品な甘さとけ合う抹茶。 (Green tea infused with exquisite sweetness)七つ、やさしく自然な甘みの紫いも。 (Gently(delightfully), naturally sweet purple potato)八つ、香ばしく味わい素朴な黒豆。　(Sweetly flavored simple black bean) The main question is what does this form of number listing do When I opened one packet there was one of each of the items indicated above instead of 1 of the first item, 2 of the second, 3 of the third etc. (Also as an aside I would be grateful if my translations receive verification and correction as well as some help for things that I was unable to translate.)
I found a list of Japanese idioms (without translations) that I wanted to study, so I sat down and looked up the meanings. Most of them I found in my trusty denshi jishyo, and a couple of them I had to resort to some internet resources (goo, Google Translate etc.), but I couldn't find the meaning of 体が余る anywhere. (Full disclosure: I found a couple of typos on the list, this one was listed as 体に余る, but Google points at it using が instead.)A direct translation would be something like "A surplus of body"...perhaps it means overweight
What's the difference between 両方 and 双方 I am definitely more acquainted with 両方, so I guess it is used for a wider variety of things, but could anyone tell me the specifics of what they can or cannot pertain to
Are there words written with "ei" or "ou" that are pronounced with both vowels instead of as a long vowel I think this is true in cases like 拾う and している, but are there cases of it happening where you'd expect to find a long vowelI ask because I thought I heard 姪 pronounced this way.
I was looking in A Dictionary of Basic Japanese Grammar when I saw something on page 329 which truly shocked me:"node cannot be used and kara must be used [... when ...] the main clause is a command, request, suggestion or invitation"×　この映画はためになるので行きなさい  ○　この映画はためになるから行きなさい×　あしたのショーはおもしろいのでぜひ見に来て下さい  ○　あしたのショーはおもしろいからぜひ見に来て下さい×　この本はとてもおもしろいのでみんなも読んだほうがいいよ  ○　この本はとてもおもしろいからみんなも読んだほうがいいよ×　いい酒をもらったので一緒に飲みましょうか  ○　いい酒をもらったから一緒に飲みましょうかI do not consider the × sentences ungrammatical at all!I, on the other hand, consider ので more polite than から, and would hesitate to use から in 丁寧語 sentences (except where only から is an option, e.g. からです, でしょうから). So I actually prefer the × sentences in the second and fourth examples.What is going on Is the dictionary wrong, am I wrong, or has the distinction between the two particles shifted in nuance (The dictionary was written in 1986).
I want to ask for a refund For example, if I want to refund a train ticket. How do I ask the train master I think it is not a 返品。Do you need certain politeness
So 運 is spelled うん, but I seem to hear most of my friends pronounce it as　あん. My friends and family are 20-60 years of age and come from mostly Tokyo and Ibaraki area. I am living in the US now and so am not speaking much Japanese, but I remember trying to pronounce it as  うん and being misunderstood till I pronounced it as あん (or maybe more like a nasal ahn).  Is this a regional dialect Does anyone pronounce it as うん Which way should I pronounce it to be understood by most Japanese
I have heard words such as shigoto, sugata, sugu (ni) and they end up sounding like shimoto, sunata, and sunu ni. Even in sentence such as Haru ga kimasu. I've heard sound like: Haru na kimasu. So why is that Do the Japanese not like the g sound (g as in gorilla) This seems to be a everyday spoken, I daresay colloquial, thing. I don't know, so obviously I'm asking.Here is a good example of what I mean. If you skip to the 4:00 mark and listen up to the 4:30 mark, you'll hear (hopefully what I hear) the "different" pronunciations of shigoto.
In particular, of the 小法師 part.I this article, we have 小法師 as こぼうし in the title, which makes sense to me given the kanji.  However, upon looking up 起き上がり小法師, I find the reading おきあがりこぼし(without the う) (found in multiple dictionaries and it's the first suggested reading on Wikipedia).Why is there this discrepancy Presumably it's just a change in sound from ぼうし to ぼし, but are there many words where a long vowel is shortened in this way
The pronunciation of intervocalic ん is a topic by itself, with the surrounding vowels tending to become nasalized, and ん itself maybe being pronounced as a nasal vowel. But that's not what I'm asking about here.In 千円{せんえん}, I sometimes hear a "y"-sound inserted after the first ん, although I believe I don't pronounce it that way myself. On the other hand, in the city name 田園調布{でんえんちょうふ}, I don't hear this "y". (I hear this word less often, though).At first, I thought it had something to do with whether the え came from ゑ or not, but it seems both 円 and 園 used to be with ゑ. Am I just imagining things, or are the cases where this "y"-sound is and is not inserted If so, what determines this
While having Ghengis Khan with some dou-min, one of them asked for "biiru hitotsu". While I could understand the biiru, I was surprised that ippai wasn't used.I understand that (number)-tsu is valid Japanese, but not why it was used in this particular case. Is using a more vague counter word more casual and relaxed, akin to saying "a beer, please" rather than "one glass of beer, please" Or would "ippai" be confusing because of the phrase "o-naka wa ippai (desu)" being used to indicate you're full
I'm aware the two kanji are often pronounced the same, but why does one contain the other in it
It's from twitter.hetusa: 福岡県筑後、羽犬塚から行方不明になっていた叔母(73才)が発見された、と知らせがありました。itoi_shigesato: よかった。hetusa: ありがとうございましたMy feeling is that it says something like 'just so'. Also, it common to respond to よかった with gratitude
昔は違っていた。昔は違った。It was different a long time ago.Do these two Japanese sentences mean the same thingHere is the sentence in the original context. The translations are not mine, but are supplied by the Japanese writer. If I replaced 昔は違っていた。with 昔は違った。, how would the meaning changeFebruary is the coldest in Japan.  日本は2月が一番寒い。It was different a long time ago.  昔は違っていた。There were ages where it was the coldest in December or January.  12月や1月が一番寒い時期もあった。But now, you can say February is the coldest month.  しかし、今はやっぱり2月が最も寒い。The seasons are getting shifted little by little according to global warming.  地球の温暖化にともない、季節もだんだんずれ始めている。
I understand that キモい comes from 気持ち悪い and I have only heard it used by women. I am wondering if it is exclusively used by women like how ending sentences with わ or かしら is only used by women.
Today I was getting help from someone behind a counter and when I had handed in my form and shown my ID, I wasn't sure if I needed to do anything else, or if I was free to go. Usually in that situation I say something like "いいですか？" and the employee quickly lets me know if I'm still needed.But this time the employee asked me "いいですか？" before I had the chance. I took that to mean that we were finished and he wanted to know if I needed anything else, which was fine, except that I wasn't sure how to respond. I wanted to say that if the form was in order, then I didn't need anything else. I guess I'm looking for a way to politely ask "Are we done" in Japanese.
I came across this sentence about a traditional festival in Japan:阿月の神明祭は、阿月地区を東西二つに分けて行われる災厄除けや病気除け、豊作を祈願して行われる。(link)The general meaning is clear, but what I don't fully understand is this part: 東西二つに分けてIts seems to me that 東西二つ is idiomatic for "all over" (judging from what I saw of a Google search of the phrase...I couldn't find a definition of them together), but the I couldn't figure out what に分けて means in this context I know could mean "separated" (分かる, to separate), but apparently in the て-form it can also mean "particularly" or "above all", which makes even less sense to me..."particularly East and West"
率直に言って彼女が苦手なのは、彼女はまず最初に他人の助けを求めるからです。Frankly speaking, I dislike her, because the first thing she does is to ask other people for help.I would like to better understand the quality of dislike expressed here with 苦手.Is it related to the other meaning of 苦手, perhaps as in "I am not good at handling her," and thus maybe less severe than 彼女が好きじゃない　How does this 苦手 compare to 好きじゃない in severity, nuance and politeness
馬鹿だからって知らないわけじゃない I translated this sentence as "It's not like I don't know that I'm stupid," while my friend who wrote it translated it as "I'm stupid, but I know that." So I feel I understand the meaning adequately, but on closer inspection, I am confused by だからって. Is it two words, だから and って, or one word, or a set phraseWJD provides this definition: だからって (exp) even so; all the same; nevertheless; yes, but ...So I suppose a better translation would be, "I'm stupid, but it's not like I don't know it," where だからって is equivalent to "but." However, does it mean more than "but" here Is it also acting as a copula What is the etymology of this expression and, if it is made up of two words, how do they act upon each other
If I see someone struggling to pick up a box, I'd say: "Do you need help with that"Or I have to run an errand very soon, I could say: "I need to buy this gift by 4 pm."Or if someone's car has stopped working, I could say: "Do you need a lift"Do the Japanese use the word "need" in this way Or is there a special word/particle/ending that provides the same usage/function
Consider these adjectives:赤い近いThe い-declension works for sentence ending as well as directly modifying a noun:Now if I want to express the adjective as a noun, for example I'm talking about "red(noun)" instead of "a red(adjective) thing":Remove い from 赤い to obtain the noun 赤.Note that く can be appended to form 赤く which exists as an adverb.赤になる and 赤くなる are both possible with similar meaning. This leads me to conclude that 赤 is independent from the 赤い which 赤く can be derived from.But if I try the same thing for 近い I find that I have to add く for it to mean a noun.Step 1. Remove い from 近い to obtain the fragment(for lack of a better word) 近. 近 does not seem to be able to stand alone (or can it).Step 2. Append  く to 近 to obtain 近く1But 近く also exists as 近く2 - the adverb that can be derived from 近い.What is Step 2 It is different from the く-declension for adverbial usage.　Why doesn't 赤い get a 赤く noun that is derived from Step 2
I read the answer to this questionHow different is 冷やかす from 冷やす And 散らかす from 散らすbut somehow wasn't satisfied.What's the difference between the 2 causative forms ～す and ～せる, e.g. 待たす and 待たせるUsually the せる form seems more common to me, but for some verbs, they both seem equally common, e.g. 聞かす and 聞かせる. Is that because the 聞かす I'm thinking of is not really a causative, but a transitive partner-word of 聞くThe linked question lists a similar, but un-productive form,  ～かす. Not the k from the stem, as in 聞かす, but a k in the suffix. 冷える→冷やかす, 散る→散らかす, やる→やらかす, おびえる→おびやかす. Are these fossilized instances of an archaic productive form, and does it have anything to do with causative
I am studying some nōgaku. In particular, the play 卒都婆小町, which I find has some interesting, beautiful lines.At the start of the play, a priest says:これは[高野山]{こうやさん}より[出]{い}でたる[僧]{そう}にて[候]{そうろう}。[我]{われ}このたび都にのぼらばやと思ひ[候]{そうろう}。which Waley translates as:I am a priest of the Koyasan. I am minded to go up to the Capital to  visit the shrines and sanctuaries there.But what is [候]{そうろう} doing Its meaning does not seem clear at all.

私に命令するな。何様だこのハゲ。Don't tell me what to do! Who the fuck does this idiot think he isBesides meaning bald, or a bald/balding person, when cursing, does ハゲ also just become a generic curse word such as "douchebag" or "asshole" In this sense, does it stay mostly male-restricted What would be the nuances of this usage of ハゲ (ie perhaps still implying an older man)My 21 year old friend said this:日本ではたとえ禿げてなくても「ハゲ」と罵ることが多々あります。
In discussing the marriage of Jin Akanishi and Meisa Kuroki, and why many young celebrities in Japan seem to fall into shotgun marriages, I wanted to use an equivalent for the term "withdrawal method", a phrase in english that is pretty innocuous. I found 膣外射精, and I was wondering if it was a decent equivalent, or if it was too racy for average conversations I've seen it translated as withdrawal method and coitus interruptus, which are pretty safe, but translated literally I guess it means  "extra-vaginal ejaculation", which besides being a mouthful to say in English, could be somewhat inappropriate in certain situations. Forgive any unintended puns in the question. Any alternative euphemisms or suggestions are appreciated if warranted.

Some years ago, I read that Japanese has a word (or idiomatic expression) that means roughly:The action of voluntary interposing a pause between themoment you desire something and the moment you start to do something to acquire it.I was never able to find it again. Does it really exist If yes, what is it Is it some jargon word (e.g. religion, philosophy)As @Sawa suggested, I'll try to better define my request. Imagine this sequence:I see a beautiful thing in a shop window.I desire it.I decide to sit down and wait.After  some minute, I get up and, in case, I go inside the shop to buy the thing.I am searching for a word that describe the 3rd step of this sequence.

I do not understand the meaning of のを:a. 彼は家を買った。 しかも大きい庭付きのを(だ)。 (だ is indicated as optional)Is it different from:b. 彼は家を買った。 しかも大きい庭付きだ。 (I'm not sure if this is grammatical)c. 彼は家を買った。 しかも大きい庭付きのだ。What does it mean when the copula takes on a direct object I have so far only encountered AはBだ,　AがBだ, Bだ but I have not seen を directly preceding the copula before.
What can be said when I need to dismiss an expectationHere are some examples of what I mean by "expectation":I ask someone what time it is, then I remembered that I'm actually wearing a watch. The person expects to tell me what time it is but I no longer require help. (Expectation created by me)I suspect I do not have enough coins to buy a drink from a coin-only vending machine. I ask someone for change. However I discover that I indeed have enough coins with me. The person still carries an expectation to help me although I no longer require help. (Expectation created by me)A waiter offers to refill a glass. He is expected to serve me because of the nature of the job. I do not wish to have a refill. (Expectation not created by me)I came up with もう要らない but I think saying that is unnecessarily direct in conveying "I no longer need (help)".
I have been reading a daily article during 朝礼.One of the sentence used the word がち. The sample sentence is:長所{ちょうしょ}は見逃{みのが}してしまいがちです。Abundant of misses.I tried to ask my colleague about the meaning of がち and they said it means [in excess]. For example if used with しまいがちです it means a lot of missesBut when I try to look at alc.co.jp for examples. There were some with no しまいがち pattern.For example:飛行機や列車の中で『にわか講習会』が始まりがちです。What does がち mean this time
OK, really esoteric question time:So I went to the cinema with a female friend on the weekend.

How could I say this in a more male (but still funny) way
In another question, I mentioned using Kana to represent the GPS coordinates for:N 43° 09.725' W 077° 26.688' I used:キタ シジュウ サン ジスウ ク チョボ ナナヒャク ニジュウ ゴ フンkita shijuu san jisuu ku chobo nanahyaku nijuu go funニシ ナナジュウ シチ ジスウ ニジュウ ロコ チョボ ロッピャク キュウジュウ ハチ フンnishi nanajuu shichi jisuu nijuu roku chobo roppyaku kyuujuu hachi funAre the terms that I used for north, west, degree, decimal, and minutes correct in the context that I'm using themnorth | kita | キタwest | nishi | ニシ degrees | jisuu  | ジスウdecimal | chobo | チョボminutes | fun | フン
Observation:The verb 好く exists.好く is transitive.By extension, "to like ~" is predicted to be:a. ~を好く。However, empirical data shows that this pattern is the accepted form:b. ~が好きだ。Question: Is ~を好く used and is it even grammatical If it is not used, why is it so

I have created a geocache puzzle based on Japanese Morse Code (Wabun Code).The final coordinates that I translated are: N 43° 09.725 W 077° 26.688 I broke this down as follows:N    4      3   °     9  .     7         2     5  'kita shijuu san jisuu ku chobo nanahyaku nijuu go funW     7       7      °     2     6    .     6        8       8     'nishi nanajuu shichi jisuu nijuu roku chobo roppyaku kyuujuu hachi funI wasn't sure about the terms for: north, west, degree, decimal, or minutes; but I thought it was probably passable. I broke these out into kana:キタ / シジュウ / サン / ジスウ / ク / チョボ / ナナヒャク / ニジュウ / ゴ / フンki ta / shi ju u / sa n / ji su u / ku / cho bo / na na hya ku / ni ju u / go / fu nニシ / ナナジュウ / シチ / ジスウ / ニジュウ / ロコ / チョボ / ロッピャク / キュウジュウ / ハチ / フンni shi / na na ju u / shi chi / ji su u / ni ju u / ro ku / cho bo / ro long(p) pya ku / kyu u ju u / ha chi / fu nAnd then mapped those kana to Wabun. I even updated the Wabun wikipedia page to combine the dakuten and handakuten diacritics and other digraphs. That was the toughest part for me to get in all my research.You can see the page at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabun_codeThis is where my real problem starts. My research showed, roppyaku should be written as ロッピャク, with the sokuon (small tsu) used to mark the double "p" consonant.For example, Pocky (a Japanese snack food), is written in kana as ポッキーFrom what I could find of Wabun, there are only diacritics for Dakuten (◌゛), Handakuten (◌゜), and Long vowel (◌̄). There doesn't appear to be any code in Wabun for double cosonant.Unable to answer this question, and not wanting to use the "wrong" form of 600 like this...ロ     ピャ              ク   ro    pya             ku  •-•-  --••- ••--• •-- •••-I went with the incorrect, but "understandable to westerners" form of 600 like this...ロ     ク     ヒャ        ク   ro    ku    hya       ku  •-•-  •••-  --••- •-- •••-What would be the correct way to represent 688 in kana and translated to WabunThe only real Wabun information that I found was on Wikipedia. All other references seemed to be based off of the Wikipedia article. Is there a way in Wabun to represent the sokuon diacritic that isn't represented in the Wikipedia article
I was trying to talk about films and (marvel) comics the other day, and stumbled upon "evil twin". Sure, I can translate it verbatim, but that usually works badly for such fixed expressions.And then when I was trying to explain it, I couldn't think of a good word for "trope" too. Apparently, neither can jisho.org. There are a few for cliche, but none of these have example sentences that relate remotely to the meaning I am looking for.Can anyone help me or send me in the right direction (A Japanese tvtropes.org perhaps)Other Japanese trope names (e.g. つんでれ) are welcome.
The following Japanese sentence was translated with その as "the":その 仕事の一部を誰かにやってもらったほうがいい。  You should get someone else to do some of the work for you.while I translated it with その as "that":You'd better get someone to do part of that job for you.When その is translated as "the," will it be ignoring some part of it's meaningFurthermore, if その is deleted as:仕事の一部を誰かにやってもらったほうがいい。would it be ungrammatical By intending 仕事 to mean "job/work in general" as opposed to specifically "that job/work," would the meaning become too vague to be adequately comprehensible

I was wondering what the difference is if I use passive form or active form of a verb.For example:ネズミは猫に食べられた。The mouse was eaten by the cat.猫は、ネズミを食べた。The cat ate the mouse.What EXACTLY is the difference between those two In what situations would I use the passive form to make a sentence.Or if I were to say:私は先生にしかられた。I was scolded by the teacher.先生は私をしかった。The  teacher scolded me.For example, I do not know if this is correct or makes sense:花子はジョーンが買ったケーキを食べられた。Would this be considered grammatically incorrect in regard to passive formAre there situations where I can use に + passive verb If so, in what casesDo Japanese prefer speaking in the passive voice as opposed to active voice Would it be appropriate to use passive voice instead of directly saying that an action was on on me (say for example: The teacher scolded me).Thanks so much!!!

In my Japanese Bible, it often uses the 〜(ら)れる Keigo form when talking about God's actions.  However, there are certain cases when talking about both people and God in the same sentence where the use of 〜(ら)れる is ambiguous as to whether it's the Keigo for God's actions, or the passive of what will happen to the people.Take this verse:あなたが叫【さけ】べば「わたしはここにいる」と言われる。ー　イザヤ書 58:9  When you call to me, I will respond. - Isaiah 58:9So I'm confused as to whether this is shortened fromあなたが叫べば（あなたが）「わたしはここにいる」と言われる　→　If you call, you will be told "I am here"orあなたが叫べば（神様【かみさま】が）「わたしはここにいる」と言われる　→　If you call, God will say "I am here"Are there any indicators as to which it might be  Does it even matter
Since there is possibility of "じゃありません" instead of "じゃないです" (which is logical, given "ありません" is polite "ない"), and it also seemed that I have seen "じゃ" used without "ない", I'd like to ask, what "じゃ" exactly means It looks like some kind of particle which was used in old Japanese but is not used any more.

The other day I was playing sports, and I yelled at a guy for what I thought was a cheap play. However, later, after the game ended and I had chilled out, I realized that I had over reacted. It's sports, that happens.So I went up to the guy and apologized, and amongst other things I said, I said something like:ごめん、俺{おれ}は、かっこよくなかったMy intended meaning was along the lines of, "[that] was uncool of me [to have acted like that]."He seemed to get what I was saying, but we were doing a lot of back and forth, with him saying 「大丈夫{だいじょうぶ}、とんでもない」 and me saying 「いいえ、本当{ほんとう}に悪{わる}かった...」, and so on. You know how it goes. So my use of かっこよくなかった might have simply got lost among everything else said.What I was wondering afterwards was if that was the right application of the word かっこいい. I was using it as a direct equivelant of how we use "cool" in English, which is pretty expansive.While I'm confident かっこいい applies to style and ambience, I'm less sure about how かっこいい applies to attitude and action.So, did I use it right Is it correct usage to describe my past uncool actions as かっこよくないCan かっこいい be used in all the ways "cool" is used in English, or are there limitations and differences

In classical Japanese, did standalone noun “好き” mean a person who likes something  I do not think that it does in modern Japanese, although it sometimes means a person when used as a suffix (e.g. 野球好きが集まる公園).If it did, it explains why 好き can be equated with ものの上手 (a very skilled person) in the proverb “好きこそものの上手なれ,” which I failed to explain in my answer to the question “Help on a specific usage of こそ” by yadokari.

I rarely have any problems with the に and で particles, but I have been a bit confused since seeing the word 揺れる in a few different sentences.As far as I know it is ok to say either:旗が風に揺れているor旗が風で揺れているWhere you could of course replace 旗 with another word like 木 or 電線.My problem is that I can't tell the difference between these sentences.To me, at the moment, they both mean "~ is swaying in the wind". But there must be some difference between these sentences that I am not seeing.Can anybody tell me the difference in meaning when it comes to the に or で particles with the word 揺れるAny help would be appreciated.
I'm having trouble figuring out how to express vague amounts of time in Japanese, such as some number of months or some number of hours.I want to use this in a context where the specific number is neither important nor known, but the factor of time passing/occurring is important.

Both 世間{せけん} and 世界{せかい} seem to mean "world" in the sense of "a sphere of human activity or interest", or "a particular way of life", and that sort of thing. (As opposed to 地球{ちきゅう}, the literal globe of a planet we live on.)What is the difference between them, thoughBonus question: When looking up the above words, I came across this odd variant: 浮世{うきよ}, which also means "world", but also means "this fleeting life". It conveys the temporariness of being in this world. Is it interchangeable to any degree with the above words, or is it strictly poetic and reserved for flowery ruminations

In my JLPT textbook, it has a section on the use of the term 離{はな}れ, "detachment". Some examples:テレビ離{ばな}れ (detachment from television)もの離{ばな}れ (detachment from things)政治離{ばな}れ (detachment from politics)However, it does not make it clear if the detachment is a willful act or an incidental act, or maybe even if it can be used in both senses.So, if I say someone is 政治離{ばな}れ, am I saying they have made a choice to stay out of politics Or am I saything that they live a life that just happens to not have anything to do with politicsOr can it mean either, and context is needed to determine which one

Here they are, with my personal take on the nuance behind their origins:活字{かつじ}離{ばな}れ ("removed from printing")文盲{もんもう} ("blind to writing")無学{むがく} ("no learning")無筆{むひつ} ("no writing ability")一文不通{いちもんふつ} ("no comprehension of writing")一文不知{いちもんふち} ("no knowledge of writing")非識字{ひしきじ} ("no character sense")I think the last one might most directly correspond to literal "illiteracy".But, in English we use the term "illiterate" two ways. One to generally describe someone we think of as uneducated or outright stupid. Another is to mean someone who is literally unable to read.So what I'd like to know is:Which of these Japanese words is the most commonly used form to describe the literal situation of a person unable to readIs that word synonymous with ignorance as it is in English Are any of these words used to convey stupidity (in other words, used as an insult)Of all these words, which are commonly understood, and which are rarely used or reserved for special circumstances
突っ込みどころ満載I just have to butt in here. / I'd love to put my two cents in.I am having a hard time figuring out this expression. I see it uses vocabulary particular to お笑い, but I would appreciate if someone would specify which meaning each word takes on in this instance, and how they work together. I am sure a better translation could be made as well. Sorry for so many questions in one!
How often does gairaigo get bikagoおトイレ is mentioned by Wiktionary, and Wikipedia mentions it being used ironically in o-kokakōra, but I haven't come across any others.One case where its absence is noticeable is referring to someone else's partner as a パートナー without an お before it (or a さん afterwards, for that matter)Are there any words other than トイレ that often get お (apart from in the speech of teenage girls)
Does anyone know the sorts of items for whose first iteration Japanese people have special names The only example I can remember at the moment is for the first leader or, to be precise, (and reveal the place I learned it), the first Hokage, 初代. Google Translate gives me a vast number of words, all essentially forms of "progenitor," for that particular kanji combination.So, are there other "first" things for which Japanese people have special names I'm aware that the Japanese culture places special importance on the first of anything, e.g., the first sunrise of the year, so I was hoping someone could list the Japanese names of a few of the more famous such things. Looking at counter dictionaries online hasn't helped me find any, and I've now (possibly mistakenly) come to realize that these names are independent of the counter system.
I saw this sentence recently and I'm particularly confused on the use of から in the sentence. まず君から殺す。What does から mean here What's the difference between that and まず君を殺す How does から replace the particle を and what are some other examples/situations where it can do this
I have been struggling to find a meaning for なめるな. The word seems to have the effect of asking people to shut up, but this is just a guess.It appears in a news story about someone's twitter comment, from last year.The last few bits of the comment are:いつもいつも私の仲間に迷惑なツイートをしてくる人に言います。私の何を知っている。なめるな
デス・クリムゾンはメーカーロゴ[画面]{がめん}[以外]{いがい}[自称]{じしょう}ほど[迫力]{はくりょく}がない。Other than its maker logo screen, Death Crimson is not as menacing as its namesake.As with the sentence above, I can use 自称 for referring to namesake.In another question, the phrase as it's claimed to be is suggested to be translated to 言われているほど. Can I use 自称 here instead Like我が国の教育制度は自称のほど良くない
Today I was reading the story of David &amp; Goliath and saw this strange pattern:ゴリアトは四十日の間、朝な夕なやって来て、同じ所に立った。ー　サムエル記上　17:16  Goliath challenged the Israelites every morning and evening for forty days. - 1 Samuel 17:16 ;  (Yes, "stood in the same place Took up his same position" implies his challenges from an early part of the story)Is this basically just a 〜も〜も pattern or does it have other uses too  What is its origin  Is it formal and/or archaic  Is it a typo in my BibleI've never seen this pattern before and cannot find anything on it.  Any information would be great.
Is 一緒に needed in this case？A: 買い物へ行きたい。B: そう。A: 一緒に行きましょうか？Or is it just -&gt;&gt; 行こう？
If you look up "cash flow" in most dictionaries, it seems the concept is expressed in katakana, キャッシュフロー.However, I was speaking with a Japanese person earlier, and the term was not immediately understood. I ended up having to explain in a roundabout way that I was referring to my income and outflow of cash, and how it effected the amount I had available at one time.Two questions:Is キャッシュフロー not in common use by everyoneIn any case, is there a clearer native Japanese term I can use to express the same concept
I wanted to know how to say "risk" in Japanese, so I looked it up, and found that most dictionaries translate "risk" as 「[危険]{きけん}」.  To me, [危険]{きけん} means "danger", which is different.Though, to be honest, when I thought of this, I realized that even in English, the difference is subtle. The two words feel very different, but I had to look on the net to be really sure of what that difference is.As I see it now, "risk" is about possibility of danger. Danger is a certainty that you either enter into or don't.So, if there is a sign that says "Danger, do not step on third rail", you know for sure if you step on the third rail, you get electrocuted. No two ways about it.However, if you hear on the news that there is ice on the roads, and so it is "risky" to go out driving, you may or may not encounter ice, and it may or may not be a problem.So, as far as I translate it in Japanese,　[危険]{きけん} is definite danger (correct me if I'm wrong about that). If I see a sign that says 「[危険]{きけん}　ー　[入]{はい}らないでください」, I expect that if I enter, something definitely dangerous will occur.If I wanted to express "risk" in Japanese, is there a word I can use Do I have to say something like 「[危険]{きけん}の[可能性]{かのうせい}」Specifically, the kind of situation I imagine this in is financial risk. Like in a business meeting where I'd want to say "I would rather not take on that risk."Lastly, I know I could maybe use リスク, but using katakana makes me sad.
I know that ～ような means "looks like". In this context:ここで立ち止る ような 時間はない。does it mean:"It appears it cannot stop here, there is no time"What I do understand is that ような is followed by a noun, which, in this case, is 時間.I don't understand the "flow" of what comes after ような in this sentence. Why does it not include *の*ようなCan someone please clarify
I saw this sentence in a train advertisement for a job placement agency:いまとサヨナラしなければ、出会えないあなたがきっといる。I don't sense a future tense at all in the independent (latter) clause because the verb is simply いる rather than a "can" form like 〜える/〜れる/〜ける。The sentence feels disjointed as the tenses don't agree.I feel that the following sentence expresses the same thing, but with a better match between the clauses:いまとサヨナラしなければ、もう一人のあなたと出会えない。Translating the original sentence literally to English as:If you don't say goodbye to the present, there is a you that you will never meet.sounds just as wrong because of the "is". It should be "there will be a you that you never meet".I understand きっと to mean "certainly", but does きっといる here serve as a future tenseEDIT: Inserted missing "you" in translation from dainichi's comment. Revised title.
In the sentence:彼の論文には大した価値はないIs the -はない another way of saying -じゃありません or -ではない And is it read as wanai or hanai
Building on from Zhen Lin's answer to "The grammar of ~かれ~かれ",Brief explanation of Zero-nominalisation:Nominalisation refers to the process of turning a word, or more generally a phrase, into a noun or noun phrase. For example, こと and もの are nominalisers for verb phrases. Zero-nominalisation is when the nominalisation happens without an overt word.Previously being examined:良かれ悪しかれ has a modern grammar rendition:[a] よいにしろ悪いにしろIt is observed that the declension of the adjective is い instead of く as one would normally expect of い-adjectives when used with a verb.Zero-nominalisation accounts for this idiosyncratic behaviour.Question:Why does zero-nominalisation occurWhy do the adjectives in [a] not take on the く declension (along with deletion of the に　particle) Would よくしろ悪くしろ still be grammaticalIn what other instance(s) (if any) is zero-nominalisation appropriate
Something I have often stumbled on is the expression of "neighborhood" in Japanese.For most uses I find that 近所 works well.However, this usually seems to refer to a closer proximity than one would equate to the english "neighborhood".When one describes a neighborhood of a city, for example, Shibuya, Minowa or Ginza in Tokyo, it seems that 近所 doesn't really apply.In the common English phrase, "What neighborhood do you live in," I have yet to find a suitable Japanese equivalent.I was suggested that 町 would work, though the speaker told me this was perhaps a flawed translation as 町 has more of the feeling of town.example:I live in Minowa.  Do you know that neighborhoodみのわに住んでいます。  みのわって町、知ってる？So what word do you think is best in asking someone, "What neighborhood do you live in" Or if this question would be so rare in natural Japanese as to be unnatural, why would this be the case
A manga character says this to someone who told him to やめろ:なんで やめろまで言われなくちゃなんねェんだよ!!Is that 言われなくてはならない and if it is, how can it be part of a question (with "nan de") I don't really understand this sentence at all.

One of my life's strangest experiences was unexpectedly ending up in Cairo, where there was a sort of extremely cheap hotel full of Japanese backpackers, part of which is described below.インド方面からずっとやってきた人や、アフリカを中心に回っている人など、さまざまで、周辺の国への渡航方法なども、ここを訪れれば、かなり情報得られると思う。I can understand how most of that works, but how does the word など function here Is it used when giving a list of examples
My understanding of と:と performs listingと indicates reciprocal actionThe above two uses are indivisible from each other. That is to say that this particle is special in a sense that it always works in both senses. (I would like to assert a homologous relation to と to its Chinese counterpart 跟[gēn])Consider:AとBとCと会ったAとBとCが会談したFor the cases above, is it:A with B with CA with (B and C)(A and B) with CIf all three are possible interpretations, how is the ambiguity resolvedCan I resolve ambiguity by:Using a pause when speaking. E.g. "Aと(pause)BとCと会った" to mean "A with (B and C)"Using と again. E.g. "Aと[BとCと]と会った" or "Aと[BとC]とが会談した to mean "A with (B and C)"

What is the proper way to ask a superior to sign their hanko for approval When I need a superior to sign their hanko for a routine log (not for reviewing a document or stuff, just routine logging off stuff out of the office), I am hesitant in saying "please sign."I think I usually say:判子{はんこ}を押してください。But I think the polite form in the office is:判子{はんこ}を押していただけませんか？But this sounds too formal, and I do not hear in verbal form the phrase 「～いただけませんか」.  Though, I do hear this in the service sector like when talking to a customer.I try to notice how the other Japanese do it, and they just give the sheet to the manager and usually just say unrelated things. Any idea, or is the verb wrong, or do you use other words than 判子 like 印字してください？
If 国体 is used in conjunction with a prefecture name like 山口国体, does that mean "The National Athletic Meet that is being held in Yamaguchi", or the "The Yamaguchi Prefectural Athletic Meet"The only definition I can find for 国体 (in the context of a sports meet) is that it's the National Athletic Meet (goo), but 国 can have a meaning of "region" or "hometown" as well as "nation" (goo), so I'm unsure as to what it can mean in this context.
I came across this phrase in a news article about a budget reduction:．．．．６千億円台になる．．．．I was wondering what this use of 台 means. I did a Google search of 円台 and the amount of yen doesn't seem to have an effect on when this is used. It seams to me to be used like a counter, but a price isn't really a machine...or is it (/cue dramatic music)My best guess is that it's means something like "an allotted amount", i.e. "You have X amount to spend, like it or not."
I was wondering if anybody had any references (preferably freely available) or insights that explain 標準語 (or should I say 関東語) sentence-level pitch accent.I already have a dictionary which describes pitch accents on individual words, but there seem to be cases where the rules change when the words are used in sentences.To illustrate with some examples:"日が" (as in "日が昇る") has no drop in pitch, but in "あの日↓は", I hear a drop after "日".After "あの", the pitch usually continues where it left off, but in certain combinations, like "あの↓人", I hear a drop after "あの".For non-single-mora words that usually have a drop between the last mora and a following particle, like "橋" ("橋↓が"), "の" seems to be an exception ("橋の上" with no drop). However, "次" seems to be an exception to this exception. I hear a drop in "次↓の".(I could be wrong about some of these, if so please correct me.)I hear good things about the NHK pitch accent dictionary, but does it describe pitch accent at this level as well I'd be thankful for any information that can bring insight on this.
What is the meaning of 腹んばい and 腹んばいになって？Also, is it read 「はらんばい」？I understand that 腹んばい悪い seems to mean 'get mad' (腹が立つ), but this other usage seems like it isn't about anger.Here is the context from Akutagawa's Nyotai:楊某  {ようぼう}  と云う支那人が、ある夏の夜、あまり蒸暑いのに眼がさめて、頬杖をつきながら腹んばいになって、とりとめのない妄想  {もうぞう}  に耽っていると、ふと一匹の  虱  {しらみ}  が寝床の  縁{ふち}  を這っているのに気がついた。From googling, this word still seems to be in use.I can't find this word in my kokugo dictionaries, which includes daijisen and genius (mac dictionary/goo).  Why is that

What is the meaning/significance of ～のみ Does it have anything to do with 身 or 見Some example sentences:しかし、予算の制限のため、差し当たり実験機のみを製造することになった。  But budget restrictions have allowed them to make only prototypes for the time being.そして、内で行われる茶の湯の作法のみが美しく見え、そこに宇宙空間や禅の思想までもが表現されたもの。  In that context, the tea ceremony becomes the focus of beauty, while ideas of space and Zen are also communicated.両商品とも、コンビニのみで販売されている。  Both products are sold only at convenience stores.
I'm trying to understand the grammar behind 当て, and after a bit of investigation I still don't quite understand a could of points. The definition that I found for it is (n) depend on, expectations, aim (various sources including goo)At first I thought it was derived from 当てる, but I'm not so sure because the meanings aren't exactly the same, and the te-form of 当てる is 当てて.I found these two verbs that use 当て:当てはまる: to apply a rule当てにする: to count on someone =/= 当てにならない: not to be relied upon当て込む: to count onMy first questions is whether the は in はまる is the particle or part of a verb.To make this even more fun and confusing for me there are the nouns that use 当て:当て字: phonetic kanji当て身: strike, blow当て[擦]{こす}り: snide remark当て[推]{すい}[量]{りょう}: guesswork当て逃げ: hit-and-runThese seem to use both the meanings of "expectations" and "hit, strike", but more of the latter, which seems to me that it means 当てる in te-form, but without the second て.I'm just looking for some kind of clarification...is there some kind of pattern here that I'm missing, or am I over complicating this Is there less of a difference between the "expectation" meaning and the "strike" meaning then there seems to me to be It may not be important in the long run, but I'd like to know when 当て and 当てる are being used. Do I just have to memorize all the variants of 当て and 当てる on a case-by-case basis

持ちつ持たれつ (meaning approximately "supporting eachother") is commonly heard, but seems to be formed from some archaic grammar. I'm assuming it's an archaic form of 持って持たれて or something like that, but can somebody confirm/dismiss/elaborate on that When was this kind of grammar in active use Are these archaic forms used in any other common modern expressions
I was reading the introduction page for Kirara Memorial Park (a public sports park) in Japan, and one of the features they listed was a 「月{つき}の海{うみ}」. As far as I can tell, in both English and Japanese this phrase only really has the meaning of "Lunar mare" or "Lunar seas" (the dark sections we can see on the moon). However, clearly this park's 月の海 is just a nice relaxing beach: see here.Next to their 月の海, there is a 「太陽の丘」. If I had seen this by itself I would have just assumed it was the name of their hill...Google seems to confirm that it's just a cool name to give a hill. This makes me think they're going with a sun/moon naming theme, but I can't say that with authority.What my question is, is there an apparent reason why they're calling their beach 月の海 By that I mean is there something I'm missing (a play on words or whatnot) that a Japanese person would catch and understand Or is it just (as far as anyone can tell) a name they gave their beach (which, by the way, I think is an awesome name!).
Here is a discussion about whether to use ご返事 and お返事, but there seems to be diverging opinions:ご返事:ご返事 is 謙譲語 (according to No.1)ご返事 is seldom used for 尊敬語 (according to No.5)ご返事 is for 謙譲語 AND 尊敬語 (according to No.4)お返事:お返事 implies intimacy (according to No.1)お返事 is 美化語 (according to No.4)Given that I always write in the context of business (sometimes about my reply, sometimes about my client's reply), can I stick to always using ご返事

Closed 8 years ago.I consider myself at a lower intermediate level. I want to improve my Japanese vocabulary and grammar in order to expand my reading and speaking skills. I know enough Japanese to get around and have a small conversation. However, reading grammar books is not cutting it and I dont feel like making flash cards from index cards with vocabulary to memorize (though if it's necessary, I will).Eventually, I would love to take the JLPT. For now, the only thing that is helping me a little bit is listening to music in Japanese and looking over the lyrics. I came to the point to replace the lyrics from romaji to kana and kanji. I sometimes try to read news articles in Japanese as well. "Thinking" in Japanese grammar certainly helps a lot. Somehow, if I listen to music and repeat the lyrics over and over again to myself, I begin to know their meaning. When I was a kid, I know realize the meaning of Japanese children's songs I've been singing.What do you suggest PS: as a funny note, upon waking up one morning, I was thinking of this person I really like(ed) and somehow, my mind said 「I miss your 事」because I could not find any other way to express this feeling in English (or my native language).Thank you!!

Having been trying to write a "sakubun", I must say that I had some trouble to find a reliable translation for the phrase "as you all know" such as:As you all know, the education system in our country is not so good as it's claimed to be.As known by all of you, the education system in our country is not so good as it's claimed to be.I'd appreciate if you translated the whole sentence; however, it's not really necessary.よろしくおねがいします！
According to Wikipedia, one theory for the etymology of くノ一 (female ninja) is that it's made up of the strokes of the kanji 女 (woman).Other theories include that it means nine and one, talking about the number of orifices men and women have, and yet another is that the term くノ一 is apocryphal. Finally, this page suggests that くノ一 might be "real", but is just a code word used by ninjas to mean woman, rather than meaning female ninja.Are there any other words, historical or present, where the characters are made up of strokes of a kanji, along the lines of the 女 etymology theory for くノ一
I think in all situations where either 一緒に could be used, 二人で can also be used, and vice versa. I suppose 三人、四人、五人、etc. can also be used here if that's the number of people you are talking about.But I'm curious as to the different connotations (if they exist) in these words/phrases.

My teacher always corrects me when I use 男 or 女 by themselves, without adding の人 to the end of it. But in various Japanese media (music, drama, anime, etc.), I know for sure that I have heard them without の人.So I'm assuming that adding の人 is a formality thing. Please correct me on this if I'm wrong.What kind of situations would it be more appropriate to add の人, and what kind of situations would it be more appropriate to not add it Basically I am wondering just how formal adding の人 is or how informal not adding it is.

What is the difference between 終止形 and 連体形 and which one is the correct term for the dictionary formThe Japanese Grammar Wiki entry says...Terminal form (終止形 shūshikei) -u  is used at the ends of clauses in predicate positions. This form is also variously known as plain form (基本形 kihonkei) or dictionary form (辞書形 jishokei) – it is the form that verbs are listed under in a dictionary.This is backed up by my teacher who described it as the dictionary form, 辞書形。The wiki describes the 連体形 form as practically identical (I don't quite understand the difference) and my teacher said the 連体形 form is 名詞にかかる形。However I've seen a number of posts describing the 連体形 as the dictionary form omitting to refer to the 終止形 form at all.Can anyone clear this up for me An explanation / example of the purpose of the 連体形 form would greatly help.Thanks.
When giving a talk on Japanese, How to talk like a ge1sha, I made a terrible mistake: I invited someone who knew something about the language along.The only times he heckled me was when he reckoned the Japanese I was teaching was too polite. (He also helped explain some concepts I was talking about) While I was aware that the teineigo form of verbs (-です and -ます) were somewhat on the polite side, he said that こんばんは wouldn't be heard in everyday conversation, outside of work environments.Is this the case Would this indicate that most textbooks and phrasebooks tend to err on the side of caution, i.e. politenessBooks where I've seen こんばんは used include the Lonely Planet phrasebook Japanese, Japanese for Busy People (3rd edition), and Mirai, a Japanese textbook for children of ages 10 to 15, and wiktionary.
払{はら}う has a number of meanings, but to summarize, it means to chase away or brush off. I often see it used in combinations like 追{お}い[払]{はら}う, "to chase off", or "to drive away".I recently came across the term はらって描{か}きます in a book about drawing. The whole sentence I saw it in can be read here.I assume this はらう is 払う and not 祓う, "to exorcise, to purify". But what exactly does it mean I'm pretty sure it isn't "to chase away and draw".I think it might mean "to draw out", in the sense of "to flesh out" - to fill the drawing out by progressively adding detail and adjusting lines to achieve a finished picture.But I'm not totally confident in that because the dictionary doesn't include any definitions that support a "to fill out" or "to flesh out" definition.So to confirm whether my guess is right or not, I'd simply like to ask, what exactly does はらって描{か}きます mean
I'm reading a book on how to draw manga style characters, and I came across this sentence. It is part of a larger block explaining how to make a character look the same from all different angles.同{おな}じ髪型{かみがた}といっても、どこから分けてあるか、どんな感{かん}じのカーブで、みけんならみけんのどこまでかかるのか、などに注意{ちゅうい}をはらって描{か}きますI think I understand the general meaning of the whole sentence, but the part where it says みけんならみけん puzzles me a bit. I get that it's talking about where to draw the brow of the face and how far across it goes (「どこまでかかるのか」).As I understand it, なら is something like "being the case that", so I translate みけんならみけん as "the brow as the brow", but that seems weird to me. How would the brow act as anything other than the brow when drawing a face My translation must be wrong because it would be redundant to talk about the brow as the brow.What is なら doing in this context
Today in my JLPT text book, I came across the word 解{げ}す.I know that the kanji 解 means "unravel", and it can be read 解{わか}る, and with that reading it's synonymous with 分{わ}かる, "to understand".When I looked up 解{げ}す in the dictionary, it also seems to just mean "to understand" when read this way.Which made me wonder - why use this reading instead of the usual 解{わか}る reading Does it carry any extra or different nuanceIs this reading as rare as I think it is, or is it just me that hasn't come across it very often
When I talked about a relative and his パートナー visiting for Christmas, the person I was speaking to asked if his パートナー was male. Is this a common interpretation of パートナー Is there a better word than パートナー to talk about a long-term opposite-sex partner who isn't marriedガールフレンド was suggested, but in English, "girlfriend" wouldn't be a good choice of words as it tends to be used for short-term relationships, especially involving teenagers.
I came across ０３年度 and ０９年度, and while the meaning is clear I didn't know the actual way of reading it. My first reaction was ゼロさんねんど, but I have no way of checking if that's right. I thought it might also be simply, さんねんど, but again I can't tell.
I've seen several of my Japanese friends use "orz" in various types of posts on Facebook.  What does "orz" mean  It's driving me nuts!
In a recent email conversation, an acquaintance used the expression:１対１で対応するそれは、大変だね。Although I can vaguely infer the meaning of the expression １対１で対応する (いちたいでたいおう), I am having a hard time finding a clear definition and description of it. All the hits in Japanese pages seem to have to do with mathematical terms (where it'd mean something like "bijective" or "one-to-one correspondence"), but our conversation had nothing to do with mathematics and the person is not a particularly mathematically-inclined person, so I doubt he'd be using it a math term for an everyday-idea... Furthermore, all the hits I got, were without that 'で' in the middle: １対１対応するMy questions:what does this expression mean in a general context Where does it come from How common/familiar is itwhich of the two forms is the correct one is the 'で' form a typo, or just a less common formis the spelling of '1' as roman numeral standard practice, or just e-mail shorthand, with 一対一対応 being the preferred way to write it
What is the etymology of the term 仏様 I am interested because of all the meanings this word can possess.
I did a quick search on this site to see if I could find any answer to this and found this question: Does the volitional form of a verb mean both "let's" and "I want to"But unfortunately that didn't really clarify things enough for me.I know that the volitional form can be used to say "Lets do ~" or "Shall we do ~" but I wanted to know if it can be used for your own actions without including the meaning of "Lets".For example could the volitional form be used to nominate yourself for somethingI know that if you wanted to say something like "I will go" you could probably say "私が行くよ", or something to that effect.But can I also use this to nominate myself to go For example if a group of people were together and it was decided that only one person needed to go somewhere would it be correct to say "私が行こう"I'm under the assumption that saying something like just "行こう" could be interpreted as "Lets go" including everyone in the group, but by being specific about yourself by saying "私が行こう" it sounds like you are nominating yourself.Is this correct or am I just making stuff upI'm sorry if my explanation isn't sufficient enough, but if you need me to add any more detail please let me know and I will try the best I can.Thank you.
For example, plugging these into Google, I can find stuff like, 自信のない人 and 自信がない人.  Or, 愛のない生活 and 愛がない生活.  I found a movie called 顔のないスパイ.  How is this any different from 顔がないスパイI've asked Japanese people this, and the only answer I've ever gotten is that that's a hard one to explain, and that there really isn't much difference worth noting.  I'd like to know the gritty details though, what little nuance each holds.I feel like I see this difference with "ない" more than anything, but that could just be me.  I can't really recall ever hearing the opposite, like 自信のある人.  Is this significant  Am I wrongThanks!
What is the general rule for saying, for example, "2 hours later"
I work in IT in Tokyo, so most of what I do doesn't require interaction with our Japanese customers, but every so often we get that one phone call where someone wants something explained, and I can always make it through, but never at the level that I want to.  The problem usually comes in with regards to computer terminology.  For example, when I'm on the spot and don't have any time to look things up, if I want to say, "if you hover over the icon, a tooltip will pop up," I just toss out something simple like「アイコンの上にマウスを動かして、クリックせずに１～２秒程待ってください。そうしますと、ツールチップが表示されます。」.  And it works and gets the point across as expected.  But I'm consistently wanting to improve upon sentences like that, to something more natural in Japanese --- in this particular example, what I want to know is, what is the most common and most natural way to say "hover the mouse over..."  Problem is I don't have time to do language research at work, and by the time I get home my brain is either fried or I just forget.I'm aware of stuff like http://e-words.jp/　for pure dictionary lookups, but really what I'm looking for is like a book that I can read during my train commute, written for native English speakers learning Japanese, and focusing exclusively on technology/Windows/programming terminology.Thanks!

I was a little confused after reading this on Wikipedia article for 宇部港, a harbor in Ube, Yamaguchi:港湾法{こうわんほう}上の重要港湾...に指定されている。I'm really not used to reading very technical writing, so there is a (pretty good) chance that I'm way off the mark, but I figured it means something like:"It is designated as an Important Port under the Harbor Act" (or however the legalese works out).What got me stuck was the use of the kanji 上 (which I, for lack of a clear reference, am reading as じょう). Is it saying that the 港湾法 is above the Ube Harbor, or vice-versa It may be how English has wired my brain, but I think of things "under a law" Is this simply the way it's said in Japanese Does it have another meaning
Consider:[A] 猫が好きだTo me this means [A']"I like cats."Contrast this to: [B] 猫は好きだTo me this means [B']"I like cats (among other animals)"I based my understanding of [B] from  Derek Schaab's answer to "What is the difference between “に” and “には”":You'll see that while in the first sentence there is only one scope, the second actually has two:(私【わたし】は）彼【かれ】と会【あ】わなかった。Scope (implied): IStatement: Didn't meet with him.(私【わたし】は）彼【かれ】とは会【あ】わなかった。Outer scope (implied): IInner scope (explicit): with himStatement: Didn't meet.Now as for what effect this has, the は often adds a hint of comparison or contrast, as repecmps mentioned. While both of the above sentences translate to, "I didn't meet with him," the second hints that although you didn't meet with him, you may have met with someone else. So I deduced that は in [B] can perform that disambiguative role.Now [A] can be interpreted to mean "I like cats" because of the implicit first person as in (私は)猫が好きだNow let's make 私 explicit:[C]私は猫が好きだ - [C']"I like cats"Now it is explicit that I am doing the liking.Now reconsider [B]猫は好きだ:Based on [C], I have another way to interpret [B]:So now 猫は好きだ can mean [B'']"The cat likes (an unspecified object)"(Questions) What is going on Who is doing the liking and who is being liked in each case Are [B'] and [B''] both valid What am I doing and understanding wrong If there is indeed ambiguity, how can I resolve it EDIT:Can I resolve it by introducing another は element E.g.私は猫は好きです。 "I(thematic) like cats(disambiguated/anaphoric)"Is it acceptable to have two はs in a sentence as above
I've read at other sites that "don't work too hard" isn't something that's generally said in Japanese. Is there any truth to thisAre there any alternatives if that is the case In which circumstances would 無理（を）しないで（ください） and 働きすぎない（で／ように） be appropriate

I was reading a short news article on students taking entrance exams in Japan, and it listed the number of students from the prefecture who took what test.Here is the excerpt I had a question about:、、、、受験者数は、地理歴史・公民（１）２０５１人、同（２）４８０４人、、、、It goes on to list subjects and give the number of people taking the test. I know 同 is used to like "the above-mentioned [blank]", usually about a group or organization, but here I think it's referencing to the subjects. I'm a little hesitant on the (1) and (2) parts. What I think it says is this that 2051 people are taking the 地理{ちり}歴史{れきし} (geography and history) and 4804 people are taking 公民{こうみん} (civics). What I don't understand is why 地理歴史・公民 has to be broken up like it is. All the other subjects are listed individually (including separating "foreign language" and "English listening").So my question is two-fold. A) Did I understand it correctly, and B) Why was it written like it was
A friend of mine wrote this sentence in Japanese:彼女のどんな困難からも逃げない態度を尊敬しています。  'Her attitude of not running away from any hardships is something I respect.'  'I respect that she has this attitude of always sticking to her guns.' If I change the の here to が, would it be grammatically correct If so, what would it mean彼女 が どんな困難からも逃げない態度を尊敬しています。
I understand もし寝過ごせば、起こしてください is wrong. I believe instead it should be 寝過ごしたら、起こしてください。In "A Dictionary of Basic Japanese Grammar" it says the second part of the sentence "...can be a command, a request or a suggestion... in this case, however, [the first part] can not be an action".As the second part of the above sentence is a request then I take it 寝過ごす「ねすごす」is an action If I'm right can anyone give more examples of action verbs as I would not have thought of oversleeping as an action like coming and going. Is their any connection between transitivity and intransitivity of verbs and whether they are classed as an actionThanks

What's the difference between 目を覚ます and 目が覚める It seems both of them have the sense of literally waking up and also to wake up from some delusion. How are they different in usage Perhaps because of transitivity the transitive version 目を覚ます would indicate deliberate agency or indicating that the action is in line with conscious(unconscious Since the person is asleep literally/figuratively) volition, while the intransitive version 目が覚める indicates spontaneity
I was wondering if there is a form I can use to express "more than X". For example, "reading more than 200 pages a day is a challenge". Or maybe something like, "reading as much as 200 pages a day is a challenge", or "I have never read so many pages before".
In daily life, I usually hear the words お客様{きゃくさま}, お客{きゃく}さん, and maybe other variants that use 客{きゃく}/客{かく} to refer to customers at a shop.However, in the dictionary, the first word that comes up for customer is 顧客{こきゃく}.I feel like I've never heard that word, though it wouldn't be the first time I realize a word I was unfamiliar with had actually been all around me all along.When is 顧客{こきゃく} used, and how does it differ from the other variants of 客{きゃく}
What is the difference in usage between these three words for "audience" 観客{かんきゃく} (audience, spectators)聴衆{ちょうしゅう} (audience, attendees)観衆{かんしゅう} (audience, onlookers)The dictionary definitions offer variations, but, none of those variations clearly make any of the three mutually exclusive from each other. It doesn't seem wrong to choose any of those to describe a group of people at a live performance.In other words, as far as I can tell, if one wanted to say, "The audience at yesterday's show was rowdy," all these would convey the same meaning:昨日{きのう}のショーの観客{かんきゃく}は[騒々]{そうぞう}しかった。昨日{きのう}のショーの聴衆{ちょうしゅう}は[騒々]{そうぞう}しかった。昨日{きのう}のショーの観衆{かんしゅう}は[騒々]{そうぞう}しかった。Does changing the word for "audience" change the impression of what kind of show it was Are any of them incorrectWhat are examples where one is acceptable and another not which clearly differentiate them
せっかく and わざわざ seem to be pretty close in meaning/usage, but is there ever a time you would use one and not the other Or is there a small nuance thereJust to give some example sentences:「せっかく来てくれたから、昼ごはん奢るよ。」「わざわざ美容院に行ったのに、雨で髪がくしゃくしゃになっちゃった。」
Nowadays, katakana tends to be used for gairaigo and onomatopoeia, while hiragana tends to be used for native Japanese words.

I have learned that when using a "-たい" form, when the sentence would normally require "を", you can use either "を" or "が", but "が" was actually preferred, "を" sounding unnatural.I searched about the reason, but could only find the same, "が" is preferred, "を" doesn't sound natural to native speakers.What is the reason since the particle is before the "-たい" verb, it can't be a phonological deformation, so what is the logic behind itThanks a lot!
I feel like mastering conjugations is a major contributor to self expression in Japanese.

What does ほか mean when it is used in a sentence like this: [situationA] ほか, [situationB]"Specifically I would like a little help clarifying the following sentence:事件事故が減ったほか、緊急時以外の通報の減少が主な要因とみられる。I am familiar with  ほか in other situations, but I'm not sure how it's used here. As far as I can figure out, it's either along the lines of "It's not that the number of accidents has decreased, but..." or "The number of accidents has decreased, but more importantly...".
羨【うらや】ましい!You're so lucky!/ I envy you!/ I'm jealous of you!As I learned it, 羨ましい as an exclamation does not carry much  of a negative context, so perhaps a combination of these three interpretations would be best. However, in Western society, jealousy and envy are generally considered negative. Though this same impulse is also present in Buddhist tradition, I am interested in how this term takes on a (mostly) positive nuance. Furthermore, are there any opinions as to why this exclamation is so common in Japanese, while an English (semi-)equivalent is notAs a reference, here is a journal entry written by a Japanese native who is puzzling over how to express うらやましい in english:日本語の「うらやましい」の中には「ねたみ」とか「嫉妬」の部  分があまりない（全然ないとは言えませんが）ような気がする  のです。だからこの場合、  ’They are lucky to travel to Korea." という軽いあこがれを  表現したかったのです。
The words 飛ぶ and 跳ぶ are both read as とぶ, the former meaning "to fly" and the latter meaning "to jump" (generally; don't know if they are interchangeable at all).The compound-verb suffix 〜込【こ】む means that the action "goes in (to)", "enters", etc.So the word とびこむ means "to jump/dive into", both literally and figuratively ("jump into (doing) a mountain of homework", "butt in to someone's business", etc.).However, とびこむ is written with the "to fly" version of the kanji:  飛び込む.Why is this  When 跳ぶ means jump and 〜込む means "into", why wasn't 跳 chosen for とびこむ  This doesn't make sense to me at all.

Warning: I have no sense of how offensive any of these words might be. They are repeated only insofar as they help me learn what not to say. Apologies for any accidental offense, and please do not read if you feel it might be potentially upsetting.I was going through this list of unbroadcastable words, and most of them, being racial epithets, terms of derision, or simple vulgarities, are easy enough to understand why they are objectionable.However, some of them are puzzling. To a non-native speaker like myself, without enough knowledge of the history, or enough feel for the language, a lot of them seem kind of arbitrary. So I'm hoping some people can give short summaries for why some of these words are not considered politically correct.Why is 芸人{げいにん} any different from 芸能人{げいのうじん}My dictionary defines both 人非人{にんぴにん} and ひとでなし as "brute of a man". Putting aside the old-school English definition, what differentiates them to make 人非人{にんぴにん} worseWhy are 家柄{いえがら}、血筋{ちすじ}, and 身分{みぶん} bad at all They are defined as "lineage", "blood line", and "social status", respectively, all of which seem kind of neutral to me. Why ban them and not things like 上流{じょうりゅう}, 階級{かいきゅう}, or 地位{ちい}Following from the above, what makes 名門校{めいもんこう} bad There's a note saying that in a particular use in reference to baseball it might be accepted, but why would it ever be seen as a bad thingDoes ザギン have any more impact other than just being a slang way of saying 銀座{ぎんざ}
In my JLPT workbook, it has a section which gives a list of idioms that use [虫]{むし}.仕事{しごと}の虫 (worker bee)点取{てんとり}虫 (derogatory term for a student who tries too hard)虫がいい (selfish)泣{な}き虫 (cry baby)弱{よわ}虫 (weakling)腹{はら}の虫がおさまらない (extremely angry)虫が知{し}らせる (forebode)虫が好{す}かない (antipathy to)虫の居所{いどころ}が悪{わる}い (in a bad mood)娘{むすめ}に悪{わる}い虫がつく (daughter has a lousy boyfriend)I'm curious about the origins of the "bug" being used in these phrases.In one sense, some of them are evocative of a sort of character, a "bug" that is present when things are bad, when there's a sense of foreboding, when one feels down. Almost like the bug is an entity that causes trouble wherever it goes.In another sense, sometimes the person being described is the "bug", as if they have become the "bug" by being weak, by being a drone, by being a whiner, or whatever the case is.So, do some or all of these uses of 虫 come from the same originWhat exactly is "the bug" when it's the first sense of a character that is present, such as when it's "in the stomach"Bonus questions:Is there any connection in terms of origins between the phrases 「腹{はら}の虫がおさまらない」 and 「腹が立つ」Is 「仕事{しごと}の虫」 equivalent to "workaholic" Or does it not have negative connotations of over-workIs 「点取{てんとり}虫」 equivalent to "teacher's pet" Or does sucking up to the teacher having no relation

I thought of this question and quickly realized that I already knew a possible example. Japanese band ZONE's most popular song is called 「secret base～君【きみ】がくれたもの～」. The lyrics can be read here or at another lyrics site of your choice. There is also a fairly new "answer/reply" song called 「約束【やくそく】～August, 10years later～」. You can find these lyrics here.In the original song, もの is only used in the title, but I think reading the lyrics should give a sense of what the title means. However, in the answer song, there is a line (referencing the title of the original song) that does use もの:今【いま】もこの胸【むね】には　君【きみ】がくれたものが　10年【ねん】たってもかわらずにBut I don't think these songs are talking about physical things that the supposed 君【きみ】 gave to the speaker, as the actual definition of もの would imply. Rather, this 君【きみ】 gave the speaker things abstract things, such as wonderful memories (最高【さいこう】の思【おも】い出【で】を… from the original song) and companionship (一緒【いっしょ】にいたかった　一人【ひとり】で泣【な】かないで from the answer song)  So, could もの be used in a figurative/poetic sense to imply that something abstract (a こと) has great value Or have I greatly misinterpreted the songBonus: Could the reverse be done as well Could こと be used to imply the insignificance/worthlessness of something that is physical, something that is a もの
Can anyone tell me more about 潔い I've looked in Goo, Alc, Kenkyusha, and Edict, and the definitions refer to "sportsmanlike", "gracious", or "take it like a man". However, I'm doubtful if these are literal translations.My Japanese teacher gave me a very interesting and different definition along the lines of "having an attitude of living properly and beautifully rather than living long". She gave the example of cherry blossom which has a short life and dies at its peak. She also mentioned 武士道 (bushido, samurai code).I don't want all my Japanese friends to think its better to die young than live long lives :)
One thing that always puzzled me was why some terms and names that are based on numbers will mix the on and kun readings. I never really understood the rules for that, but it occurs to me that there must be some.For example, the word yakuza is derived from 8-9-3, a no-score hand in the 花札 (hanafuda) card game. This comprises:や  — 8, ya(ttsu), a kun reading  く  — 9, ku, an on reading  ざ  — 3, za (for san), an on readingSimilarly, the famous Admiral Yamamoto had a given name of Isoroku (meaning, curiously, "56"), which mixed kun readings (or their variants) for 5 and 10 plus the on reading for 6.I just want to know how to make sense of this — or if it is even necessary that it make sense. Perhaps it is simply a matter of putting together sounds that the originator(s) of the term found pleasingEdit: I want to add that the usages sometimes seem capricious to me, as when you hear 二人（ふたり）to refer to two people but 二人前（ににんまえ）to refer to a restaurant serving for two people or the task that two people have before them, although you can hear ふたりまえ there as well.

On this page, different readings are give in different dictionaries for べき乗打切り待機法: べきのりうちきりたいきほう in JMDict and ベキジョウウチキリタイキホウ in コンピューター用語辞典. The English translation given in both dictionaries are the same: "truncated binary exponential back-off".Which of these readings is correct Or, if they are both correct, can they be used interchangeablyI know the べき乗 for exponent is read as べきじょう. Where does the reading べきのり come fromNote: I don't actually use the word, nor do I understand its exact meaning. I saw it on this answer. I know べき乗 is read as べきじょう, which means exponential, so I thought the reading in the answer was wrong. I tried to find out what it actually means, but search results from the internet are mostly dictionary results. Most of the readings given are べきのりうちきりたいきほう.

TVTropes also mention that not all Tohoku residents speak in the same way, either - not relevant to this question, but I don't want to misinform anyone.What advantages and disadvantages are there in speaking in the local dialect (ie their vocabulary and grammar) and/or accent (ie how they pronounce words)Disadvantages:If I'm seen as deliberately doing an "zuuzuu-ben" accent, will people think I'm making fun of it TVTropes mentions that that accent has been made fun of in fiction. It's possible I'll accidentally pick up a Tohoku accent during my stay, but then it'll be the real thing, rather than an exaggeration of it.I'm more likely to get something new wrong rather than something I've practiced for a while.A foreigner speaking a local dialect or accent may be seen as a bit silly.Advantages:Speaking with a local accent would probably make it easier to understand when other people speak with that accent. For example, if I have previously said "itsu" with a Tohoku accent, then I'll be more likely to understand when someone else says "itsu" with a Tohoku accent. Speaking in the local dialect or accent may give the impression the speaker is putting more of an effort into what they're saying, which is seen as respectful.

I have trouble trying to find this specific grammar in text books.I have a negative adjective in polite form:寒くないですI want to use the superpolite form:寒くないございますThat seems right, but I have seen in a grammar book that when using other words, they replace the い　with う, like this:面白うございますIs the first example correct If not, what is the general rule to apply in these cases
Through this question I want to understand exactly how ぜひ is used adverbially.My problem is that ぜひ is not behaving as I expect it to be. It appears that the English translation does not reflect its correct usage:ぜひ: "certainly, without fail, right and wrong, pros and cons"I take "certainly" and "without fail" to be its adverbial use.I observe that:These sentences do not appear to me to have the sense of "certainly" and "without fail". E.g.,ぜひおいでください。 "We'd like you to come."ぜひお試しを。 "Please try our products"I would (poorly) interpret them as follows instead:"Please come without fail""Try without fail"There seems to be some intermediate step that causes "without fail"  to soften and become part of a request (the actual requesting should be from a ~てください or an implicit one).In English, "~ certainly is ~" and "to without fail be ~" and "~ without fail will be ~" are possible sentences. However, what I would expect to be the equivalent in Japanese - ぜひ～だ is ungrammatical. I seem to be misunderstanding something very important about the usage of ぜひ and I can't figure it out.From sawa's comments in "How are で and ばかりused in this expression",是非 is an adverb expressing the first person's expectation, and has to concord with a predicate that expresses such meaning. Your first sentence with 是非 without 願う is ungrammatical. Because just a copula is an assertion. There is no room for the first person's expectation to come in. I've been meditating on those 2 points and I guess I just don't get it. It should be because I do not understand the usage of ぜひ. In what way does ぜひ exhibit expectationSo please tell me what have I understood wrongly.
I'm reading through a book on how to draw in a classic Japanese manga style. Specifically, the book is about the basics of デッサン, "sketching".They use the term アタリ a lot. For example, this typical sentence:アタリ線{せん}は残{のこ}っている。下描{したが}きのりんかく線{せん}がはっきりわかるように、アタリはごく薄{うす}い線{せん}で描{か}こう。The context is that in the example drawing, they have more or less finished the drawing by having laid down the bolder lines that emphasize the final image, while leaving some of the sketchy lines underneath so one can see the original contours used to create it.アタリ線{せん} clearly refers to the "final" lines, so I guess that could work as a translation. But obviously "final" is far from a literal translation of アタリ.Looking up アタリ specifically in katakana, I see that it is defined as "collision, overlapping". Overlapping makes sense, but it still feels off to use it directly. When one is drawing, one doesn't merely sketch and sketch until overlapping lines become the ones you keep (at least, that's not the default assumption. I guess some people might draw like that). Instead, one deliberately lays down the lines one intends to keep.Translating アタリ線{せん} as "overlapping lines" seems to convey too much serendipity."Bold" lines "Clean" lines "True" linesWhat would be the best translation for アタリ in this contextBonus question: Does the katakana アタリ come from 当{あ}たる, 中{あた}る, or maybe a different origin I ask because I notice that when I look it up using katakana, I get different definitions than when I look it up using kanji.
来年は是非明るい年でありますように願うばかりです I hope that the next year will be great for youIs this sentence grammatically incorrect In what way(s)If incorrect, why can  でありますように not be followed by an explicit verbCan it be followed by another type of verbHere is the original example http://omo-ashi.progoo.com/bbs/omo-ashi_topic_pr_704.html
来年は是非明るい年でありますように願うばかりです I hope that the next year will be great for youWhy is で used in 年であります Is であります an older form of です Also, what would the ばかり translate to here I thought maybe it could be "just", but that meaning does not seem right.Also, what is the nuance of this expression Is it clunky and outdated, florid and verbose or none of these
今年も良い年でありますように！ I hope you have another good year!What is going on exactly where the ように means hope Does the よう derive from a verbI would also like to know how to describe this word in the relevant grammatical terms, both in english and japanese.

It's a topic of debate to what extent Japanese has sarcasm and irony. In any case, Japanese speakers seem to use a whole lot less of it than English speakers.My question is: whether or not Japanese speakers use it themselves, do they typically recognize what is—to Americans at least—very blatant verbal irony Or will they commonly assume the sarcastic party has gone suddenly insaneExampleA: どうしてサハラ砂漠になんて行きたいんですか？ハイキングでもしたいの？B: いや、泳ぎに行こうと思ってます。Would a super-fluent speaker be able to sell this kind of irony Would a なんてね at the end of sentence B make it work

I was reading this and it didn't make sense to me. This pirate wanted a drink, but the store was sold out. So one of the guys offered to give him an unopened bottle, but it only made the pirate mad.

I need help understanding why にとって cannot be used in this circumstance:その仕事は私｛には/*にとって｝出来ない。 ( * denotes unacceptable)This is what I read:にとって cannot be used when it marks an experiencer or agent But I get confused when this sentence is acceptable:これは我々にとって無視できない問題だ。Isn't 我々 an agent 我々 is the one who is doing the ignoring right So what am I understanding wrongly

While in English, the word "gaijin" is far more common than "gaikokujin", I've heard that in Japanese [外人]{がいじん} has been replaced by [外国人]{がいこくじん} for reasons of political correctness.What differences are there between the two words Is it merely replacing one word with another, a case of a euphemism treadmillIs the former perceived as a contraction of the latter, though Wikipedia claims that the former word pre-dated the latter Contractions are often seen as derogatory.Does the latter emphasize that it's nationality that's being talked about, rather than race
On the train yesterday, I came across this ad, which is just for some mascara or whatever:Sorry it's a little blurry. The text is 凛{りん}と際立{きわだ}つ艶ロング。I'm just a little unclear on a couple of things.For the first kanji, 凛{りん}, my dictionaries say it means "cold", but I can't see how that connects to mascara. Is that the right meaningThe other question is on the last kanji, 艶. Is it read つや or えん The different readings seem to have different meanings, but they could both apply. つや is "gloss, glaze, charm" and other meanings, while えん is "charming, fascinating". Which is it
Is it appropriate to use [先生]{せんせい}, either by itself or as an honorific after their name, when addressing a ski instructorI'm not sure whether it'd be appropriate because:Using 先生 in this context may be disrespectful of other kinds of teachers, in that skiing instructor may be a less honorable profession than other kinds of teaching.It may be too formal or cold or impersonal, and therefore not appropriate for a recreational activity.

Years (Gregorian) can be read out in English:A – two digits at a time;B – each digit separately;C – full reading of the number.  For example:2012:"Twenty twelve";"Two zero one two";"Two thousand (and) twelve".1988:"Nineteen eighty-eight";"One nine eight eight";"One thousand nine hundred (and) eighty-eight" (Slightly awkward sounding).I have two questions:Can A, B and C work for Japanese too I.e.1988年: "じゅうきゅう はちじゅうはち ねん";"いち きゅう はち はち ねん" (or "ひ ここの や や ねん" );"いっせん きゅうひゃく はちじゅう はち ねん".If the above are not suitable, then what would be the proper wayWhat (and how strong) is the preference for the type of reading for years in Japan In Gregorian years or in the format of Japanese-Era + Year number
I was amused by, and interested in, this little sign on a water dispenser in a sandwich shop:The options are that you can have ice only, ice and water, or just water.What intrigued me was that water, 水{みず}, is preceeded by an honorific お, but ice, 氷{こおり}, is not.Both are being served to a customer, so why not お氷{こおり}
Although the there are several definitions in the dictionary: my condolencesthat's too badmy sympathiesWhat does お気の毒に literally mean I'm guessing that it might have something to do with "poisoned ki".After checking the dictionary, this phrase seems to be said to someone who has had a death in their family. Is it also used in other situations, such as:To someone who has a family member with a terminal illness (cancer), just diagnosed with cancer, living with cancer, dementia, parkinson's, etcSaid directly to the person who has the disease or debilitating condition
According to When is the katakana form of wo (ヲ) used, を is almost always used only for the particle, and is usually pronounced o (お).There are some dialects where を is pronounced with a "w", but the same is true for the obsolete kana ゐ and ゑ:Because the pronunciation was lost. "Wi" and "we" are still in some  dialects, but standard Japanese does not have those sounds. These  characters were just spelling. Similarly in English, we pronounce  "through" as "thru" because the "gh" sound is long gone. [emphasis added]Why was を spared even though ゐ and ゑ have been deemed obsolete Was changing the writing of the object marker particle seen as too radical a change Or is を pronounced "wo" more widely than ゐ and ゑ are pronounced as "wi" and "we"
I cannot find a clear difference between these two kanji:勅 : Imperial decree (みことのり、ショウ)詔 : Imperial edict (みことのり、チョク)The English definitions for "decree" and "edict" are so similar, I think the only main difference I could pinpoint was that "decree" had the aspect of formality (although it seems to me that an edict is also formal)edict:  noun  1)  a decree issued by a sovereign or other authority.  2)  any authoritative proclamation or command. decree: noun  1)  a formal and authoritative order, especially one having the force of law.(You will notice "decree" is used to define "edict"...)The Japanese definitions of these kanji are also similar, but I'm not adept enough to read into the subtleties:勅:  １ 天子の命令。天皇の言葉。また、それを記した文書。みことのり。 ２ 尊貴の者からの命令。詔: 天子の命令を直接伝える文書。みことのり。詔書。The second definition for 勅 says it could be used to mean orders from people beneath the level of the Emperor.So my question are these kanji just interchangeable synonyms that mean 天子の命令, or is there a definite difference (other than the secondary definition) Normally I would write them off as synonyms, but I feel that there are often specific words for things when dealing with traditional Japanese customs, etc.
In Japanese (and other East Asian languages), the denominator of a fraction is read as a part of the modifier to the numerator:3分の5  'five that was divided by three'  'five thirds'This indicates that East Asian languages interpret fractions as the result of division operations: "five divided by three" (which is a "modified five" rather than a "modified three").On the other hand, most/many Western languages interpret fractions not in that way, but count how many unit fractions there are (which I remember reading in a book when I was a junior high-school student that it dates back to the ancient Egyptians):five thirds  'there are five unit fractions whose denominator is three. I.e., (1/3) * 5'How did these different groups of languages come to adopt these different thoughts in expressing fractions
It seems to me that 千 is exceptional in having it prefixed with 一.As for 一, 十, 百, they work together with 千 to describe the numbers from 1 to 9999, so they compete with one another, or are complimentary. There is no combination like:一一, 一十, 一百, 十十, 十百 百百As for 万, 億, 兆, 京, etc., they are multiplied by a number from 1 to 9999, expressed by the prefix using 一 十, 百 千, so when that prefix turns out to be 1, 10, 100, 1000, then they are combined, and there are combinations like:一万, 十万, 百万, 千万, 一億,　十億, 百億, 千億, etc.and there is no combination among themselves such as万万, 万億, 億億, 万兆, 億兆, 兆兆, etc.However, 千 is exceptional in that it is prefixed by 一 just when itself is prefixed to the characters 万, 億, 兆, 京, etc.千  一千万  一千億  Why is 千 prefixed with 一 in this case Why is it not like the following千  千万  千億
I need help understanding the difference between の代わりに and に代わって.This is how A Dictionary of Intermediate Japanese Grammar explains the difference:の代わりに cannot be used when "replacement" is expressed:[1] 戦後ガラス｛に代わって/*の代わりに｝プラスチックが出てきた。　(*denotes incorrect)に代わって cannot be used for on-the-spot substitution of objects:[2] エコノミークラスではガラスの食器{の代わりに/*に代わって}プラスチックの食器が出る。 (*denotes incorrect)(Question) What do they mean by "replacement" and on-the-spot substitution I am still quite unable to understand the difference. Isn't on-the-spot substitution a form of "replacement" If one is a subset of the other, then both の代わりに and に代わって should be able to be used for one type of sentence, while only either の代わりに or に代わってbe used for the more specific case.Being distinguished as per [1] and [2] seems to make them mutually exclusive.Also as an aside: What sense of 出る is used in these sentences
信じようと信じまいと Believe it or notHow is 信じる　being conjugated here I am unfamilar with the stem + まい pattern, if anyone could explain the ins and outs of that, or provide a more literal translation if that would make it easier to comprehend.

Some people use the word エンターティナー to mean 'entertainer'. I suspect this word comes from the English word entertainer. But the accented vowel is "ei", rather than "i". It would be a better approximation to transcribe it as エンターテイナー. Although the latter form is used, the former one is also used. How did ティ arise in place of テイI had once thought of a possibility of hypercorrection, but am not sure.
There is a word イレーザー, which means 'eraser'. I suspect this comes from the English word eraser. But the "s" sound in eraser is not voiced in American English, and a closer approximation in kana will be イレーサー. How did it become voiced as イレーザーEdit: After fefe's answer, it turned out I was wrong in writing that "s" is not voiced in English. It turned out to be true for American English.
Based on the comments from Tsuoyshi Ito's answer to Translation of 竜すらも恐るるに足らない,恐るるに足らない/恐るるに足りない is a set phrase meaning "not worth fearing".Based on my understanding of 一段 verbs like 足りる, negation will yield 足りない.How do I get to 足らない
The full text is...この魔剣があれば…　メルヴィンの言うとおり　竜すらも恐るるに足らない…Is this a double negative "Even dragons to be not afraid is not enough" = "Even dragons are [will be] afraid".
The full sentence is:反撃の機会は幾度もあった…　どういうつもりだ…"There were many chances to counter attack... what is your intention".But the event took place in the past so why is it not どういうつもりだった… "What was your intention" ～だ is present tense and ～だった is past tense。
When you want to associate a noun を します action (what English-speakers would call "verbing a noun") with a specific noun, what particles are used and whereFor example, if I was saying "I study", you could say 勉強{べんきょう}をします. But if you were wanting to say what you're studying, would you move the particle を, so that it'd be 日本語を[勉強]{べんきょう}します, or would you keep the particle を, and add a の between the additional noun and the verbed noun, so that it'd be 日本語の[勉強]{べんきょう}をします
Is the gairaigo メリー mainly used in the set phrase メリークリスマス (Merry Christmas!) or can it be used without the クリスマス to mean "merry", such as 私はメリーです to say "I am feeling merry"There's also メリーゴーランド (merry-go-round), but that's more like a transliteration of a single noun.If it's mainly used in the set phrase, is there a term for loanwords used only in set phrasesNote: The answer notes that メリークリスマス is not a set phrase after all.

日本女性で電車の中で化粧をする人を見ると恥ずかしいくて嫌な気持ちになる。In my understanding, the で following 日本女性 could correspond here to the english "of," or "speaking of."Thus one interpretation of this sentence (though in unnatural english) could be:Speaking of Japanese women, seeing someone put makeup on in the train makes me embarrassed and uncomfortable.Is this interpretation correctFor the sake of comparison, here are two other interpretations of this sentence made more natural. Hopefully the meaning does not differ greatly.When I see Japanese women putting makeup on in the train I feel so embarrassed and uncomfortableSeeing Japanese women putting makeup on in the train makes me embarrassed and uncomfortable.
気取らない彼が好きです。 I like him, who doesn't put on airs.My first reading of this sentence was to assume that 彼 was referring to the boyfriend meaning of 彼, and thus my interpretation was "I like an unpretentious kind of boyfriend". My second interpretation was wrong as well= "I like a guy who doesn't put on airs." The correct interpretation is the definite pronoun, him.However, can 彼 be used to mean guy or man in the same way that words like やつ and 男 are used as indefinite pronounsDon't be that kind of guy. : あんなやつみたいになってはいけないよ。Don't be that kind of guy. : あんな彼みたいになってはいけないよ。(I now think this interpretation is incorrect)I like a kind-hearted kind of guy: 心優しい彼が好き。I suppose the right interpretation of this sentence would be, "I like him, who is kind hearted" (I like him because he is kind hearted)Would this be correct
I'm translating bits of Hyrule Historia to test myself a bit and I'm a little confused by this sentence structure.  お面を使うリンクI'm inclined to say this translates to something along the lines of:"Link uses a mask."But can someone explain to me why the subject is appearing after the verb and without a particle
I read the other two questions on なう on this site, and I want to know what the most common way to add なう after a verb is.I've seen なう most frequently with nouns. This is supported by http://nanapi.jp/258/ which was linked in one of the previous なう threads. Some examples of なう after a noun from that site:東京【とうきょう】なうTwitterなう年末【ねんまつ】なうI did a quick search on Twitter for なう and found a few examples with verbs, but they were in different conjugations. I've (slightly simplified and) listed some of these below:楽屋【がくや】にいるなう (dictionary form + なう)終【お】わったなう (past tense + なう)寝【ね】てるなう (ている form + なう)There are probably more, but those are the few I found quickly. I'm not sure if the fact that there were no long/polite conjugations of the verb is due to people being casual on Twitter or if it's part of the "grammar" here.Since it's slang, I doubt that there is any actual, grammatical rule that comes into play here, so I just want to know what the most common way to conjugate a verb when placing it before なう is.
There are times when both 五日 (5th day of the month) and 何時か (someday) could be used I think. Does this become a minor problem for Japanese when speaking (no kanji to guide), or do they speak in some way to avoid the possible confusionA sentence I thought of where either いつか could be possible:いつか、アメリカに行きます。Are they going to America on the 5th of the month, or are they expressing intent to go to America eventually in the future
For the number zero, [零]{れい} is a Chinese origin word that is pretty much familiarized in Japanese. Nevertheless, it seems more popular to use the Western origin word ゼロ, which probably appeared later. Why is that They are both two morae, and I don't see any phonological reason.
In this Bump of Chicken song, the line 笑えないかな is used a number of times.For example:全て受け止めて笑えないかなIf only I could just accept everything and smile.誰かに優しく出来ないかな　全て受け止めて笑えないかなIf only I could be kind to someone. If only I could accept everything and laugh.笑えないかなIf only I could laugh.The translations are a combination of those provided online, my native speaker friends and mine.If I translate 笑えない literally I come up with "I can't laugh."With 笑えないかな, I get "Can't I laugh"So how does "Can't I laugh" become "If only I could laugh." I see the correlation in meaning but I am not 100% there in understanding it. I guess verbない + かな has this nuance of "If only.."The more literal way of saying this phrase would be”笑えたらいいのになぁ” "If only I could laugh."But how does this colloquial version work

My Japanese professor (I'm in first-year Japanese) advised us to primarily avoid the use of second-person pronouns like あなた or 君 or おまえ throughout the year, and essentially treated their utterance as something of a faux pas. However, I've been exposed a lot of Japanese language media (primarily anime and music) and their use therein seems to be pretty okay.I understand that あなた is used by wives to refer to "their dear husband" or something, and that 君 and おまえ are ostensibly inappropriate (the latter considerably more so), but do Japanese people in Japan actually pay attention to these distinctions I'm inclined to think that my professor advised against their use (as well as the use of a slew of other words I attempted to use from my experience, including 俺、彼／彼女 and あいつ／あいつら) simply to avoid beginning our instruction with something overly informal.tl;dr version: Are second-person pronouns as societally ill-advised as my professor would like to have me think In what contexts (e.g., with friends, with older family members, with colleagues, or with superiors) are their use acceptable
When reffering to the school days, people often say 小学校の時, 中学校の時. Even though this may not be wrong, they are shortened forms of relatively complex (redundant) structures. Thus, they are close to the expressions:私が通っていた学校が小学校だった時  'when the school that I used to attend was an elementary school'  私が通っていた学校が中学校だった時  'when the school that I used to attend was a junior high school'  I think that there is a much simpler way to express the same situation, such as:私が小学生だった時  'when I was an elementary school student'  私が中学生だった時  'when I was a junior high school student'   which would be shortened to 小学生の時, 中学生の時, and I do hear people (including myself) using the latter. But still, many people seem to be using the former. Why do people use a more complicated way of saying it
Sometimes, people tend to use metaphors from arithmetics to refer to something in ordinary life. For example, to mention some claims or preferences common among people, the expression 最大公約数 'greatest common measure' is used even though it is not about numbers. I kind of understand that because there is no immediate counterpart that expresses the corresponding concept for non-numbers. But I don't understand why people say 未知数 'unknown variable' for some non-number that is unknown. There is a word 未知 'unknown' that is related to and is simpler. Why do people say things like これからの情勢は未知数だ instead of saying これからの情勢は未知だ

A zillion years ago, before I came to Japan, I took a short introductory course on Japanese. In it, they showed a video of a business meeting where an American businessman is speaking to a Japanese businessman.The Japanese businessman kept saying 「はい、はい」 throughout the business meeting. The result being that the American assumed that the Japanese guy had agreed to the proposal they discussed. However, the Japanese person was only saying はい as a way of expressing agreement that he heard and understood what the American was saying.From there, it was explained that in Japanese, agreement is often about the person making the statement, not the topic. はい can be used to mean "I agree to the degree that it allows this conversation to continue." A little like saying "sure, okay" in English.In English, I can differentiate between agreeing with a premise and agreement with a person. If I say "yes", I am definitely agreeing with the premise. If I say "sure", I'm going along with the person, leaving room to be ambivalent about the premise.I'd like to get better control of the same thing in Japanese. Without resorting having to express myself with lengthy sentences or explanations, how can I be sure I'm conveying that I agree with a premise or with the personAre these appropriate for stating definite agreement with a premise:確かにそうだAre these more ambivalentはいうんええAre there other phrases and words I can use to be clear in differentiating whether I'm agreeing with a person or a premisePlease note I'm specifically looking verbal ways of handling this, not other contextual clues like gestures or facial expressions. I would like to be able to express myself clearly in writing and on the phone as well as in person.
The verb 堪える has three different readings: こたえる, こらえる, and たえる, and as far as I can tell they all mean "to bear, to endure, to put up with", with slight variations. Is there a way to tell which reading is correct in any given instance Is it nuanced or a regional variance

Closed 8 years ago.I recently tried to look up the kanji 胡 in the Kodansha Kanji Learner's Dictionary, which uses the SKIP method to look up each kanji, and I couldn't find it. It seemed to me a relatively straightforward kanji look-up using the SKIP method: It is clearly divided side-to-side (making the first digit '1'), and the number of strokes for the left hand side is 5 and the number for the right hand side is 4 (giving it a SKIP number 1-5-4). I tried every trick I know to find it and eventually did...under the wrong classification. The '4' and '5' have been reversed so that it is 1-4-5. It's hard for me to think that this dictionary could be wrong, but I've counted the strokes so many times I don't see where I could be mistaken. I've searched around so see if any else has had the same trouble, but I can't find anyone. Does anyone know why it's been placed where it has Am I missing something

In English, &amp; is rather frequently used to mean "and".How should &amp; be read in Japanese I think these are some likely readings:やとアンドCase 1: Assume sentence structure is of the form "A &amp; B", where "A" and "B" are objects. Now the word "and" would just be doing listing:Apples and orangesThis seems easy to achieve with や for inexhaustive listing and と for exhaustive listing.Case 2: Now if "A" and "B" are not objects, but events/instructions/etc. The word "and" does not merely list. It can imply sequence:Brush my teeth and go to bedThis seems to be achieved using the て form of the verb. (Can &amp; in Japanese do that)(Question) What are the ways that &amp; is used in Japanese and how should it be read in each case
If I understand correctly, the main usages of ことがある seem to be the following:Verb(plain)+ことがある: There are times when (I)Verb(past)+ことがある: (I) have experienced (something) beforeBut after this question, I'm starting to wonder when ことがある means "there is a thing/there are things" instead of "there are times when".When looking through Space ALC and Google searches, I'm thinking ～たいことがある might mean "there's a thing I want to (do)" and ～たくなることがある "there are times when I want to (do)" based on the way they're used, but I can't be sure.書きたくなることがあります "there are times I want to write" ()書きたいことがあります "there are things I want to write" ()What are the different usages of ことがある When does ことがある mean "there are things" rather than "there are times when" and how can they be told apart
I have to apologize for a procedural error at work, and am unsure about selecting the right form of apology from the variants of 「ご迷惑をおかけ・・・」:1.「ご迷惑【めいわく】をおかけして申【もう】し訳【わけ】ございません。」2.「ご迷惑【めいわく】をおかけして申【もう】し訳【わけ】ありません。」3.「ご迷惑【めいわく】をおかけしてすみません。」Also, whether or not to append 「でした」to the end.The thing I am apologizing for is a mistake in a business purchase. I charged a purchase to my corporate card, but should have had the vendor bill monthly using the 分割払【ぶんかつばら】い option. So a brief explanation, concluding with this apology, will be written in the comment section of my expense report. The reason for apologizing is not to really say I am sorry, but just to let everybody in the approval chain for my expense report know that I now know I did it wrong, and won't do it like this in the future.I chose to write it as follows:「ご迷惑【めいわく】をおかけしてすみませんでした。」Reasons:Firstly, this is an internal company communication, and the people to whom I will submit this document are of a lesser coporate rank than myself (although they are not my subordinates, since the work for the Finance Department). So I felt like 「申し訳ございません」was too much. (Also, I confess, because I don't yet really understand the full nuance of super-polite self-humbling apology in Japanese, so I tend to never use verbs like 「ございます」or 「いたします」. )Does that reasoning make sense Secondly, as for the 「でした」 at the end, I put it in the past tense because the procedural error I made happened last month. The way I think of it, I'm saying, "Sorry for the error I made last month," so I put it in past tense. But I wasn't confident about this, because the actual bother I am causing them is actually happening at the time I submit my expense report. So in a different sense I am saying, "Sorry for the bother I am causing you right now by submitting this unexpectedly high expense report, due to the error I made last month". Thought about that way, I wondered if the apology should be in the present tense.Which is correct Or might either one work(And speaking of apologies: sorry for the two-part question; I couldn't cleanly separate these two concerns.)
To compare two things, I would use:りんごのほうがみかんより美味しいです。i.e. noun のほうがnoun よりadjectiveBut how can I say, "Out of these five fruits, apples are the most delicious"Or "Out of Seoul, Tokyo, and Shanghai, Shanghai is the biggest"
Recently I was studying the use of から and だから as conjunctions. Could anyone explain why one is used in these examples while the other is notAre there rules as to whether から and だから can follow a phrase or a clauseI am pretty clear as to why から and だから are used in the first two examples, but in the last three, in examples 1 and 2 I am confused as to why the answers provided to me are the correct ones. I understand the second example.これは僕のお気に入りだから、気をつけて使って下さいね。  It's my favorite, so please be careful.私は、日本語を学んですでに4年になるが、自分の日本語の不十分さから、日常生活で面白い失敗を起こすことは珍しくない。  It has been four years since I began learning the Japanese language, but since my Japanese is not proficient, it's not unusual for me to make some rather interesting mistakes in using Japanese in my daily life.１．最近寒い（から・だから）身体に気を付けて下さい。２．最近寒くなった（から・だから）身体に気を付けて下さい。３．例年以上の寒さ（から・だから）身体に気を付けて下さい。Answers:1．寒いから2．寒くなったから3．寒さだから
I am struggling to understand the word "とりあえず". It seems to mean 'as it stands'.Here is an example sentence as I understand it:とりあえず計画がありません  'as it stands we have no plans'Is this correct Also, I'm sure I've heard it with the imperative.
I came across the following in a newspaper article: 藤沢健太教授（宇宙物理学）らの研究グループThe first part (藤沢健太教授) is the name of a professor (Professor Kenta Fujisawa). The parentheses say "Astrophysics", and the last part (の研究グループ) indicates his research group. It's the ～ら that confuses me. I had only ever heard ～ら after かれ or お前, so I did some searching, and I found these sites. This source says it is used for かれ, but doesn't elaborate.This source says that it is an informal version of　～たち, which doesn't seem to fit in the context of a newspaper (unless I'm wrong about that), or the very technical topic. And this source simply says that it's another version of ～たち.I'm still unclear as to when one should use ら if it's informal, yet also in the paper. Does anyone know　the nuance of it
Closed. This question is off-topic. It is not currently accepting answers.                                            Want to improve this question Update the question so it's on-topic for Japanese Language Stack Exchange.                Closed 6 years ago.                        Improve this question                    I got a message from a friend, about to go on a trip, and it ended with: お土産持しててねI think it's basically "[I'll] bring a souvenir/gift/omiyage [for you]" but I'm not familiar with the 持してて part, I've never seen it used like that before.And if it does mean what I think, what is a polite way to say "you don't need to do that!". Would いいえ or maybe お土産話だけよ would be OK
I was talking with my colleagues about work and my friend described the following situation:The boss asked my friend to make a report for a meeting that they had at the end of the day. He worked really hard on it but then our boss never used it.Drinking with them later that night, they described the boss/situation/work as 理不尽. I know the dictionary definition is unreasonable or irrational but it doesn't seem to fit this situation very well. It seemed to be used in the sense that it was troublesome or bothersome.Is there a better way to express this feeling in English I'm struggling to think of it.
I came across the structure [V simple-past]とはいえ、、、、　and I can't figure out exactly what it means.I found this いえ is 言え, and it means the same as とは言うものの... which I don't really understand perfectly either, to be honest. As far as I can tell it seems to mean "With that being said, X."Am I close to the mark, or far off
I am having trouble when naming a variable, deciding if I should use ABC種別 or ABC区分. I have been reading a lot of software specifications and the Japanese description usually uses 種別 and 区分 to specify a type or a class.When do you use 種別 and when do you use 区分 For example, for a device, would you use 種別 or 区分 to differentiate the type here Is this just a preference Added based on the context comments (2011/12/12):I was referring to customer types. I do ask my colleague, why they use 区分、種別 or even 種類 pertaining to the same variable but they just say they are the same. Example of usage that I see, for example column names of database tables (Customer=&gt;TOKUI_KUBUN,TOKUI_SHUBETSU) or (User=&gt;USER_KUBUN,USER_SHUBETSU). I do think they are essentially the same with subtle difference. It just is annoying which one is the more appropriate one especially if you want to make a naming convention.
I am trying to better understand this sentence:金さんは、微妙なニュアンスまで気にされてて、すごいですね。It's amazing how interested you are in these subtle nuances.Is the following an accurate understanding of this contractionWritten in what I perceive as basic, plain Japanese (without honorifics), perhaps the sentence would read as thus:金さんは、微妙なニュアンスまで気にしている。それは、すごいことだ。Then the " いる。それは、" can be contracted to金さんは、微妙なニュアンスまで気にしていて、すごい。Then the する is put into 敬語 and further contracted.金さんは、微妙なニュアンスまで気にされてて、すごいですね。I know the order of this process is arbitrary, but is my understanding correctIf anyone could explain what the していて、/-てて is doing specifically, I would appreciate that as well.
A question was asked on the Linguistics Stack Exchange about the oriental languages. The title was the following: How are line breaks handled in ideographic scriptsThe answer made me think, and I thought I'd ask here to have a wider range of answers on the matter.When writing Japanese, if we reach the end of the page, can we split the Kanji and their okurigana I'd like to bring an example but nothing comes to my mind, so feel free to provide one, in case I don't do that first.And another question on the first one: does this change if we are talking of handwritten VS typed Japanese
I use The Kodansha Kanji Learner's Dictionary, which describes pronunciation in romaji instead of kana. I never learned romaji in a classroom, and generally only use it when reading this dictionary.When "ō" is not proceeded by a consonant (like "tō" is), how does one know how transcribe it into kana I first used "おう" (such as "tō": "とう"); however, through trial and error, I came to realize that "おお" is more accurate. Then, I came across the kanji 扇 in my dictionary as "ōgi", and realized that, if I typed "おおぎ" or "おうぎ", both displayed the option of 扇.It's quite possible this is a "spellcheck" type safeguard (the Japanese equivalent of "the" being typed out when "teh" is entered) because I have checked around various online dictionaries (Wiktionary, Yahoo!dict) and it turns out that in this case, 「おうぎ」 is indeed the correct transcription. Is there a definitive way of knowing in other cases, solely by reading the romaji
I've come across two kanji, which are both read やなぎ　and both mean "willow".From what I've found out so far, 柳 has an On'yomi of リュウ　and it seems to mean more "things with the qualities of a willow"; while 楊　has an On'yomi of ヨウ　and means the type of tree. That being said it also seems to be a name element. Can anyone confirm this or shed some more light on the subject
From what I learned,もらえる = もらうことが出来る'can be got'見える = 見ることが出来る'can be seen'This looks like there is some kind of a more general rule for this transformation.If there is a pair of such verbs, is the one with ~え~ always meaning ~ことが出来るIs there any rule when can I create a ~え~ verb this way
Some examples of what I'm trying to convey:I have never heard that song before.I have never heard of Miyazawa KenjiI have never heard of that beforeI've never heard of that storeWhat verb should be used Is there a common form I can adoptIs there an equivalent phrase in Japanese
時代の流れを感じずにはいられない。  I can't help but feel time passing by.彼のことを同情せずにはいられない。   I can't help but to feel sorry for him.私は、彼の才能を賞賛せずにはいられない。  I can't help but admire his talent.Would someone please explain in detail how "~ずにはいられない。" means "can't help but"Is the いられない a form of いる？ If so, which oneOr is it related to this:「～し（せ）ざるをえない」
I'm writing a business e-mail to a Japanese speaking person, and I need to direct them to a certain URL. In English I would write "please visit http://www.example.com". I'm not sure the best way to say that in Japanese. My best guess is something like "http://www.example.comに訪ねてください", and if I was writing a friend I'd probably just try that figuring that they'd understand even if it wasn't quite right. But since this is formal business correspondence I want to make sure it's right.
Does anyone have an opinion on the etymology of the word マラ, a crude term for penisAny thoughts on usage are also appreciated.(via archive.org)　http://gogen-allguide.com/ma/mara.html
I used to always use 訂正{ていせい} rather than 添削{てんさく} to mean "correction", but recently I haven't really seen 訂正 being used. When used in the context of correcting English translations etc, it seems to me 添削 is used almost exclusively.What is the difference in nuance between these two words
I came across a N1 vocab list and came across 魂 with the reading as こん, and I had known that as たましい. I know is one is 'on' and one is 'kun', but if it's just by itself I was under the impression that it's read たましい. Does anyone know definitively
と、て、ってWhat's the difference between these three quoting particlesIs there any grammatical difference, or are they just casual/formal variations of one another田中さんは行きましょうと言った  田中さんは行きましょうて言った  田中さんは行きましょうって言った  Would all three of those sentences be grammatically correct
It purports to be a kamikaze chant, and appears near the end of the book. Being basically a Gravity's Rainbow nerd, I have always wanted to be able to write it out in order to impress other literary geeks. It goes:Hi wa Ri ni katazu,  Ri wa Ho ni katazu,  Ho wa Ken ni katazu,  Ken wa Ten ni katazu.I can't make out enough of its kanji to find a match using Google, but if it's any help, it means: Injustice can not conquer principle, Principle can not conquer law, Law can not conquer power, Power cannot conquer heaven.
For example, consider the following English phrase:Speaking Japanese is much harder for me than speaking English is for you.How would one put this in Japanese Would...私が日本語で話すことは、貴方が英語で話すことより、難しいです。... workWhat would be the natural way to express it
When writing in some formal Japanese CV (学歴/職歴), it is common to be asked to put each job/university/etc. on a single dated line, with a second line to indicate when one quit/graduated/dropped-out/etc. E.g:平成２０年　４月　１日　　東京大学情報学部入学平成２４年　３月３１日　　同上卒業平成２４年　４月　１日　　松下電器産業株式会社入社etc.University enrollment will be 入学/卒業, post-grad would be 進学/卒業, job would be 入社/退社...My question is then:What is a proper equivalent to indicate a research internshipThat is a non-paying, temporary research position in a public (government-run) lab facility that is not a university (国立研究所). In such a case, it seems that both 入社 and 入学 would not fit. 入所 sounds like it might be a possibility, but also may be a complete mistranslation (since the word also exists for completely different situations).I would welcome any suggestions, (preferably) with pointers to approved examples or other authoritative sources...
If I was to put the suffixes 流{りゅう}, 風{ふう}, 的{てき}, 式{しき} and 様{よう} on the end of a noun etc, what would be the difference between themI could be wrong, but the following all seem to me to mean something similar to "Japanese style" and I'm having trouble telling the difference between them:日本流日本風日本的日本式日本様(I'm not sure whether 日本様 is used or not, but I think 日本様式 is.)
I'm making a shirt for a (rather egotistical) friend of mine and so am trying to do something with the slogan "I am the best" for fun. I need something with four characters only, and would like to ask the difference between 私の一番,   私が一番,   私は一番, and which one would be the most appropriate in the context that he is saying it of himself. My grammar is not fantastic. I understand that が would entail a meaning like "I am the number one" versus は which would be "I am a number one" (correct me if I'm wrong). One of my friends has suggested 俺が一番,   俺様一番 Can someone explain to me how 俺 and 私 differ then I'm quite confused. Also, this is for a boy, just in case anyone wonders.
I have trouble understanding the concept of 野菜ソムリエ.I have searched Wikipedia and others but I can't understand if it is the name of a media job, or the name of a restaurant job.I feel it might be more of a cultural question actually, but I don't know yet as I don't understand the word itself.
控える as far as I can tell behaves more predictably than 控えている in that it generally seems to mean "to refrain" and "to make notes" (as in 電話番号を控える.)However, 控えている seems to mean many more things including "expecting (a baby)", "to be soon", "waiting (for)", "facing", "contend with" and "abstain from":彼女は出産を控えているの？  Is she expecting （a child）ちょうど1年後に控えている  be just a year away.使者が次の間に控えている  The messenger is waiting in the next room.彼の別荘は後ろに山を控えている  There is a mountain behind his country cottage.その会社には幾多の難問題が控えている  The company has many difficulties to contend with.彼は健康上の理由から肉を控えている。  He abstains from meat for health reasons.Would I be able to ask how to define 控える and 控えている, how they have come to mean so many things and whether there's a way of determining what 控えている means in a given context
This was from a test prep book:A: この間の本貸してもらえないかな。  B: ええ,明日持ってきてますI'm thinking that the V てもらえない form is often used for requests.My literal parsing of 貸して　＋　もらえない is:'Can I not receive the favor of your lending (it) for me'Which then translates to'Can you lend it to me'Is my translation correct I'm not sure why there is かな at the end. I thought it is used to indicate uncertainty.
I always thought only 他の existed, but my teacher uses 他に a lot. Are there differences between when each can be usedHere are two examples of each from my online dictionary:だれかほかの人に聞いてごらん (Ask somebody else for help)ほかに行きたい人はいますか (Is there anyone else who wants to go)In both of these examples, I feel like ほか is describing 人, so why are different particles used
I am a bit confused about a sentence I came across in an anki deck:誰もその話を知らない。I know that that 誰 means "who" and も means "also", but the translation it gives me is:"No one knows that story."Someone please explain.Thank you n_n
What are the different ways to produce nouns from other parts of speech and how are they differentFor example, 高い has these nouns produced from it:高さ高みFor 近い :近くAlso nouns can be formed by adding もの or こと to verbs in 終止形 and 連用形:笑い物 (using 連用形)笑い事 (using 連用形)笑うこと (using 終止形)And also from just the 連用形:笑いWhat is the difference in:the type of nouns formed between ~さ, ~み and ~く .between [Verb-連用形]＋もの and [Verb-連用形]+ことbetween [Verb-終止形]+こと　and [Verb-連用形]What are the other ways to produce nouns that are useful to knowLike adding 主義 for example:資本(capital) turns into 資本主義(capitalism).
I have read in grammar dictionaries some words/phrases that are labelled as "Written Japanese" and should not be used in normal speech.Let's take for example the sentence-ending こと indicating a command:プールサイドを走らないこと。 "Do not run on the pool deck"(This was taken from A Dictionary of Intermediate Japanese Grammar and it's labelled as "Written Japanese".)What I want to know is what happens to "Written Japanese" when:I read it silentlyI read it aloud to myselfI read it to someone elseFor the above, do I read it as it is written or do I convert it to a "Spoken Japanese" equivalent
I have a question about the last sentence here taken from this essay:やっぱり旅っていいな…としみじみ感じます。  'Then you will know the true joy of travelling.'食事の後はちょっと外へ出てみましょう。  'After your meal, go outside for a while.'なんと宿のすぐ裏でホタルたちが一面に乱舞。  'You will see a myriad of fireflies dancing right behind the inn.'その幻想的なことといったら息をのんでしまうほどです。  'The phenomenon will take your breath away.'The English translation provided, though conveying the right idea, is very loose. Here is my more literal translation (which doesn't flow as nicely):'Just speaking of such a fantastic thing, it's enough to take one's breath away.'I am wondering who is speaking in this sentence and whose "breath is being taken away" (yes my translation is still quite figurative). Is it (a) the speaker (I guess this is called 1st person singular) = "Just speaking of such a fantastic thing takes my breath away" Or is it that (b) if "one were to describe the event it would take one's breath away" = (third person singular) Or (c) a combination of these = 'If I spoke of these things it would be enough to take your breath away" or (d) just ambiguous If there is a clear answer, how can one ascertain who is performing these actionsEdit: Or perhaps I should understand these as two figurative phrasesその幻想的なことといったら = such an amazing thing息をのんでしまうほどです。=just breath-taking!I apologize in advance for my ignorance of grammatical terms.
By itself, I would say that 「ただいま」 means something like "just now". I've used it a few times in sentences like this, but it feels somewhat awkward, as I am always reminded of  ただいま戻【もど】りました.So, for example, would ただいま in the following sentence sound unnatural/awkwardただいま、面【おも】白【しろ】い事【こと】に気【き】づきました。
I see that the WWWJDIC emphasizes western style restaurants for the word レストラン. So would there be a better word to use in 中国レストラン
I always get a bit confused with だろう, which I've asked about before. In my other question, I got the impression that たろう meant a certain amount of assertion, and だろうか left some room for uncertainty.This sentence is at the end of a longer piece of text in my JLPT practise book:教師{きょうし}のアドバイスに耳{みみ}を傾{かたむ}ける必要{ひつよう}もあるのではないだろうか。I took it to mean something like, "Should we necessarily listen to the advice of teachers" The rest of the text, too long to reproduce here, explores two sides of an issue, which the teachers are on one side of. So I thought it reasonable that the author is leaving it to the reader to decide if they want to agree with the teachers or not.However, from the content of the questions, it seems that the book is telling me that the person who wrote the above sentence definitely sides with the teachers.So, is だろうか more assertive than I thought it wasWould it be more accurate to translate it as: "We should definitely listen to the advice of teachers."
When browsing through journal entries by various people, I've recently been noticing the words 述{の}べる and 語{かた}る used fairly frequently but I'm not sure when they should be used over 話{はな}す and 言{い}う etc as I think there's a lot of overlap. Would it be possible for me to ask when the following words should be used言{い}う: to say述{の}べる: to express/state/say表{あらわ}す: to express (as per @yadokari's comment, I'm not sure how 表す and 述べる differ.)話{はな}す: to speak/talk語{かた}る: to talk/tell伝{つた}える: to convey/tell告{つ}げる: to inform/tell教{おし}える: to inform
What do we call the different types of strokes of kanji/kana in Japanese For example, in Chinese the left-downward stroke is called 撇[piě] and the right-downward stroke is called 捺[nà]. And if I wanted to describe what 八 looks like, I would say (in Chinese) "一个撇, 一个捺".Are the Japanese names for strokes commonly used I would assume so since it's a rather convenient way (for me at least) to describe what a Chinese character looks like in the absence of any writing material to show it (alternatively I could write in the air). Can I similarly describe kanji using Japanese names for the strokes
If they both mean the same, is が optional
This sentence was from a JLPT N2 prep book.卵からかえったばかりの魚は体が透き通っている。I don't understand the part that modifies 魚. Here is how I parsed it:卵から かえった ばかり の 魚From egg/returned/just/noun modifier/fishSo I thought this means "The fish that just returned from eggs", which doesn't make any sense.
I have this question in my JLPT textbook:男女{だんじょ}平等{びょうどう}といっても、女性{じょせい}＿＿＿の差別{さべつ}はまだ残{のこ}っている。A ゆえ　B たる　C なり　D こそThe book says the answer is A, which is weird to me because I thought ゆえ was kind of like "ergo", or "as a result from". If you say 女性{じょせい}ゆえ, it seems to me like one is saying that somehow the 差別{さべつ} is because of women.So I must have ゆえ wrong. What exactly does it mean
This question is in my JLPT practise book:親{おや}のしつけが子供{こども}の性格{せいかく}形成{けいせい}に＿＿＿＿ことは言{い}うまでもない。A 通{つう}じる　B 通{とお}す　C 関{かん}する　D 関{かか}わるThe book says the answer is D, but to me the definitions of C and D overlap so much that I can't see why one is obviously better.So what's the difference between 関{かん}する and 関{かか}わる
Consider:自分について書きたいことがあります。 = There are times that I want to write about myself (lit: things concerning me)自分自身について書きたいことがあります。What is their differenceI think the second sentence has more emphasis on "myself". If so, is this emphasis too subtle to translate effectively into EnglishAlso, is there any change in formality or colloquial nuanceWhen translating into English, would the best option in the second sentence be to just put "about myself" into italics This seems unnatural.
I understand fine how to use 〜(の)よう{に・な・だ}, but I'm not sure when or how you can add in the か.  Here's an example from my book:４月になって雪が降るなんて、まるで冬が戻って来たかのようです。How is this different than if it had just said 戻って来た(の)ようです  Is it purely adding more emphasis  Are there any restrictions on when you can (or can't) add the か
According to JDIC, both mean "observation".Judging from the Kanji used, I'm guessing the difference is 観測 has a nuance of observing something and measuring some aspect of it or taking data, whereas 観察 is just to observe and monitor what's happening.
Here is how Wiktionary defines オブジェ in the context of art:表現の対象となるもの、前衛美術では，幻想的効果のために取り入れられる物体。My very hesitant attempt at a translation:It depends on the represented target, but in avant-garde art it is an object that has been transformed in order to produce an illusionary effect.Could you improve my translation of the Wiktionary definitionIs the result a good definition of オブジェ
This is a question in my JLPT practise book:手遅{ておく}れかもしれないが、死{し}んだ＿＿になってやれば、間{ま}に合{あ}うかもしれない。A もの　B わけ　C つもり　D はずNone of the answers made sense to me, so I didn't even choose one.The book says the answer is C. I didn't choose that one because it seems to be saying, "if you intend to die, you might make it."I get that there could be a metaphorical meaning here, something like "try so hard you might die", but I'm still having trouble parsing the sentence so that it conveys the sense of "as if". I'm just not used to seeing つもり used in a hypothetical way.What would be an accurate translation of this sentence, and does つもり have a broader meaning than just, "intend to"Bonus question: Is 死{し}んだつもり the same as saying 必死{ひっし}
In my JLPT practise book, it has two different entries, one to explain がる and one to explaining たがる. It offeres these example sentences to differentiate them:うちの子{こ}は新{あたら}しいものを見{み}ると、すぐほしがる。うちの子{こ}は甘{あま}いものを見{み}ると、すぐ食{た}べたがる。I think they both mean to behave in a way that expresses the feeling described. So, ほしがる means to not only hope for, but to act like you hope for it, and as a result, everyone who sees you will know you are hoping. Something like that...　I don't have a pithy way of explaining がる.So, if my definition is right, it seems both sentences are explaining essentially the same thing, and the only difference is one is attached to a verb, and the other is attached to a... um... something else. Whatever the grammatical category of ほしい is.I'm confused about why the book is going out of its way to explain them separately.Is there a difference in definition between がる and たがる beyond just how they fit into a sentence grammatically
This question is in my JLPT practise book:オリンピックの日本{にほん}代表{だいひょう}選手{せんしゅ}は、みんなの期待{きたい}____金{きん}メダルをとった。A にこたえて 　B に応{おう}じて 　C に沿って 　D によるとI chose B, because it seems to me that it's saying "in accordance with everyone's expectations." Or, put another way, "as everyone expected."However, according to the book, the answer is A. But that seems weird to me, because I think of にこたえて as "in response to." Maybe it's just me, but I don't think of expectations as being something that gets answered. Instead, expectations get met.Where am I going wrong here
This sentence comes from a question in my JLPT practise book that is part of an explanation of the use of ものなら:一度{いちど}仕事{しごと}を手伝{てつだ}おうものなら、それをいいことにあの人{ひと}は何度{なんど}でも頼{たの}んでくるから、気{き}をつけたほうがいい。My fractured translation is, "If helping out a little is something you intend / that's something good / asking that person's help / you should take care."As you can see, though, I can't make the connection between asking for help and why one should take care.What exactly is this sentence saying, and how does it relate to the use of ものなら
I came across this sentence:四月だというのに、結構寒いね。 "It is April, but it is rather cold isn't it"Recalling what I learned about the のに conjunction, I can also make the sentence:四月なのに、結構寒いね。(Question) What is the difference
My JLPT practise book has these two sentences to help explain the difference between お目{め}にかける and お目{め}にかかる in a context of keigo.それでは新製品{しんせいひん}お目{め}にかけましょう。鈴木{すずき}さんという人{ひと}に初{はじ}めてお目{め}にかかりました。Unfortunately, the brief explanation they give about these sentences is not quite enough for me to be sure I've got it.I think the first case, お目{め}にかける is when you're asking someone else to look at something. "Please look at X."And I think the second case of お目{め}にかかるis when you're doing the looking. "I saw X."I often get these kinds of differences mixed up. Can someone either confirm I'm right, tell me if and where I'm wrong, or enlighten me if there is some other nuance I should be aware of
What are the differences between 技術 and 技能
Excerpt from A Dictionary of Intermediate Japanese Grammar:Consider the difference in the sentences below:[a] 昼間遊ぶ代わりに夜遊ぶつもりだ。  I intend to play at night instead of having fun in the daytime.[b]　昼間遊んだ代わりに夜勉強した。   I played in the daytime, so (to make up for it) I studied at night.[c] 昼間遊んだ代わりに勉強するつもりだ。   I played in the daytime, so (to make up for it) I intend to study at night.[d]　昼間遊ぶ代わりに夜遊んだ。   I played at night instead of playing in the daytime.I shall generalise the sentences to the form [X]代わりに[Y].For [a] and [d], X and Y are regarding the same activity (遊ぶ). So when used with 代わりに, Y occurs while the action is not performed at X.For [b], X and Y are separate activities (遊ぶ and　勉強 respectively). When used with 代わりに, both X and Y have the activity carried out.I think where I'm having trouble understanding is becoming evident. There seems to be a missing construction where X and Y are separate activities, and only Y is carried out.I'm trying to convey "I studied at night instead of playing in the daytime" (The action of playing is not carried out).I know that there are ~ないで and ~ずに that does approximately the same thing, but they create sentences that are "Without X, do Y" which does not have the nuance that "instead" creates, which is "Do Y in place of X"(Question) Can 代わりに do what I'm trying to do If yes, how Or must I use a different word altogether References:  1: A Dictionary of Intermediate Japanese Grammar, Seiichi Makino and Michio Tsutsui (ISBN4-7890-0775-8)
な感じ was crossed out and replaced with という感じ in a sentence that I wrote that was similar to this one:その文には「それは私にはもったいない」 な感じ という感じ があると思う。  I think that sentence has a feeling of "that's more than one deserves."What's the difference between な感じ and という感じ when written after quotation marks
I've just found out that there's a couple of words for milk, and that they have slightly different meanings. Which one would I have with my Weetbix in a "viking style" breakfast in NisekoBased on the following links: JREF and Japan forum page 1 and Japan forum page 2 it seems that:牛乳 refers to cow's milk in particular, and the kanji for cow and milk appear in it.ミルク is the gairaigo term. It's used for baby's formula, coffee, tea, desserts, powdered milk, or to mean "milk flavored". According to Berlitz Earworms (not any of the links mentioned), the Japanese for milk tea is ... "milk tea". Presumably the concept is so foreign they don't even add vowels to it or use cha!お乳 is baby-talk for breast milk, and is also used for breasts. (I'm not sure if it means the breasts of a nursing human mother, or can mean the breasts of any woman, or whether it used to be innocent baby-talk for a nursing mother's breasts and is now used in a vulgar sexual way for any woman's breasts)おっぱい is another childish way of referring to breasts and breast milk - perhaps without it being used in a slangy sexual way[母乳]{ぼにゅう} means mother's milk, non-babyish and non-slang.Would I be correct in concluding that apart from breast milk or unprocessed milk, 牛乳 is used for traditional forms of milk, and ミルク is used when modern technology is involved and/or the milk is being used in a way that's untraditional (akin to the second paragraph of this answer on "Why was ライス borrowed from English")If so, would I use ミルク as having cereal and milk isn't native to Japan(Warning: googling only for miluku chichi produced some NSFW results)
Warning: Potentially offensive terms.I'm watching The Walking Dead on Hulu Japan with Japanese subtitles. I've noticed that the English dialogue and Japanese subtitles differ a lot. More than usual. It seems to me the quality of the translation is very low.In one part, a character who is a vulgar racist propositions a woman, and she turns him down. In the English dialogue, he derides her by calling her a "rug muncher". Which is a derogatory term meaning "lesbian".The Japanese subtitle for when he says this is, though, is:菓子{かし}を盗{ぬす}みやがったMy understanding is that やがる is just a disdainful way of ending a sentence, so it means something like, "fucking candy stealer."I googled the phrase 菓子{かし}を盗{ぬす}み, but didn't come up with anything clear. It might mean "crybaby", but that seems odd - wouldn't 盗{ぬす}み refer to the thief, not the victimSince the overall quality of the translations is so low, this might not have anything to do with what was said in English.What does this phrase mean, and does it have anything to do with the original English
Consider these example sentences taken from SPACEALC:[a] （人に）電話をかける。 "put in a call to ~"[b] ~が（主語に）電話をかける。 "receive a telephone call from"My observations: Both sentences use かける. Transitivity is unchanged, there is no use of られる construction to indicate passive sentence structure. Yet one is "to call" and one is "to receive the call". So [a] and [b] do not seem to be consistent.In an attempt to resolve the inconsistency, I looked for other examples.Consider other sentence also from SPACEALC:[c] （～から）電話がかかってくる。 "get called (主語に)"[c] leads me to conclude that かかる is the intransitive counterpart to かける, and sentence [b] should be wrong.(Question) How do I express "calling" and "receiving a call" Is the passive form of かける used at all(I.e. かけられる) Or is the passive of かかる used at all(Question) Can I call the person performing the calling 電話をかける人　and the person who is receiving the call 電話がかかる人
Consider this example sentence from SPACEALC:あなたがどうしているか気になっていた。　  "I was concerned about how you were."What is the difference when 気にする is used instead I.e.,あなたがどうしているか気にしていた。～なる seems to convey "spontaneity" or "arising from nowhere" while ～する seems to convey deliberate agency. Would ～する mean to be deliberately concerned about the person The ～する version seems to be "more concerned" than the ～なる version because of explicit agency.
This question is in my JLPT practise book:このチームの試合{しあい}の切符{きっぷ}はなかなか手{て}に____ない。A 取{と}れ　B 入{はい}れ　C 入{はい}ら　D 持{も}てMy translation is, "I can't easily get the tickets to this team's games".Well, that's sort of my translation. This issue is that according to the book, the correct answer is C, but I chose B.It seems to me more normal to use 入{はい}れない, as in "I can't get the tickets", instead of 入{はい}らない which I think would mean "I don't get the tickets."I have a sneaking suspicion that 手{て}に入{はい}らない is some kind of special case, but it's not clear in the book's explanatory notes.Can someone break down why 入{はい}らない is right and 入{はい}れない is wrong
As far as I understand it, 祝福{しゅくふく} means "bless". I came across it in this sentence, and it struck me as weird:だれもが彼の成功をうらやむと同時に、心から祝福した。My rough translation is, "At the same time that everyone was envious of his succes, they blessed him from their hearts."I think I get the grammar and syntax, and I also get that people can be envious and grateful at the same time, or something like that.It's just that to me (perhaps only to me), the word "blessed" has a lot of weight to it in terms of religious origins and conveys implications of ritual. I don't want to get too much into the English meaning of the word "bless", though.My main point is that I wonder if "bless" is really the most accurate translationPerhaps it means more like "grateful"
This sentence in my JLPT book is explaining the nuance of 映{は}える, but actually it's the use of ほしい that's a puzzling me a bit:このピンクのスカーフが映{は}える服{ふく}を選{えら}んでほしい。This is saying that the pink scarf would go with some very flashy clothes.What I'm not clear on though, is if it is the speaker saying that they would like to choose some flashy clothes to go with the pink scarf. In other words, it's the speaker who is doing the ほしい.Or, is it that the pink scarf itself is simply more suited to going with flashy clothes Similar to how in English I could say, "this pink scarf cries out for more flashy clothes to go with it." In other words, it is the scarf doing the ほしい.So is it the scarf or the speaker that the ほしい part of the sentence refers to
This sentence is in my JLPT practise book in a section on the use of 目{め}まぐるしい:社会{しゃかい}の目{め}まぐるしい変化{へんか}についていけず、時代{じだい}遅{おく}れになる会社{かいしゃ}も多{おお}い。I think the sentence is saying, "There are lots of companies that do not keep up with the bewildering changes in society."If that's right, why does it use 会社{かいしゃ}も多{おお}い instead of 会社{かいしゃ}が多{おお}い
Another sentence from my JLPT practise book, this time in a section explaining the use of ものを.借金{しゃっきん}で困{こま}っていた友人{ゆうじん}を、助{たす}けようと思{おも}えば助{たす}けられたものを、見捨{みす}ててしまった。I think this sentence is saying, "My friend who was having debt problems / if I had thought about helping I could have helped / but I forgot about it." If I'm on the right track in the meaning, then I'm not sure what ものを is bringing to the party here.Is this sentence equivalent:借金{しゃっきん}で困{こま}っていた友人{ゆうじん}を、助{たす}けようと思{おも}えば助{たす}けられたけど、見捨{みす}ててしまった。If so, what extra meaning does ものを have that would make one choose to use it over けど
This sentence comes from my JLPT practise book in a section explaining the use of 解{と}く:練習{れんしゅう}問題{もんだい}は答{こた}えを見{み}ないで、自分{じぶん}で解{と}いてください。I get that 解{と}く means to "unravel" or "solve", but the sentence seems to be saying "When you can't see the answer to the practise questions, solve it yourself."Which seems odd conceptually to me, because I can't really imagine a situation in which someone needs to be looking up answers for questions they could solve anyway.So I'm wondering if there's something about 解{と}く that I'm not getting. Or perhaps some other part of the sentence.What does the sentence mean, and how does 解{と}く play into it
I have been going over the JLPT test from 1999 and came across this problem that stumped me.  For those planning to take the previous tests as practice you may want to avoid this question.優勝戦{ゆうしょうせん}は、意外{いがい}に＿＿＿＿＿勝負{しょうぶ}が決まった。A　あっけなく 　B　そっけなく 　C　はかなく 　D　ものたりなくThe correct answer is A, あっけなく, but I'm not 100 percent sure why this is a better choice than ものたりなく.  Even the other two look like acceptable choices to me.In the end, after looking up all the definitions, I picked A because of the 意外{いがい}に, which suggests that the 優勝戦{ゆうしょうせん} was expected to not be so simply decided.But when I thought about it more, D also seems like a suitable answer because I would expect the championship game to be interesting as much as non-trivial.I concluded that D was not correct only because I could find many examples of it being used, but I'm afraid I'm still missing some of the nuance behind the correct answer.For any interested further in my logic, I did this problem on my stream where I go over all the answers and look up examples, recorded at http://www.youtube.com/watchv=KnmEiRkck3s&amp;feature=channel_video_titlefrom 6'30"and continued at:http://www.youtube.com/watchv=ShOpaZ9iOmw&amp;feature=channel_video_title
I apologize if I am beating a dead horse with this question but is this correctなっている: have (already) becomeas opposed toなっていた: had becomeso often the meaning of なっている can be thought of as "is" while なっていた can be thought of as "was" was:ある朝目覚めると私は有名になっていた。  One morning I awoke to find myself famous〔イギリスのロマン派三大詩人の一人 George Gordon Byron （1788-1824） の名言。  One morning I awoke to find myself sacked.（気が付いた時には首になっていた）のようにして使われる。〕いずれこうなっていたと思いますよ。  This would have happened one way or the other. (does it work for the latter example)is:なんでこんな遅い時間に買い物に行くの」「閉店まぎわにスーパーに行くと割引になっているんだよ」  "Why do you go shopping so late" "Things are discounted if you go to the supermarket just before closing time."「ゲーセン」として知られるゲームセンターは、若者の人気のある遊び場所となっている。  The game center known as "Gehsen" is now a recreation spot for young people.
This might sound like a strange question, but how does the usage of commas differ when used in Japanese compared to EnglishI believe りんご、オレンジとバナナ wouldn't work, but that it's OK to list like りんご、オレンジ、バナナ or りんご、オレンジ、またはバナナ. When should りんごとオレンジとバナナ and similar be used instead of commas or vice-versaI've heard that going e.g. 分かりにくくて、読みたくない with i-adjectives isn't correct but 分かりにくいし、読みたくない and 分かりにくく、読みたくない is. I'm guessing it's OK to go 簡単で、特に問題はない and 簡単し、特に問題はない rightAdditionally, what is the meaning of 、。 at the end of a sentence, e.g.　気にしてなかったけど、。 I think it might have some kind of emotive effect, so I think I'd translate it as "I didn't really care though" (for emphasis.) I might translate 、。 as "I'm flustered that..." in some other contexts but I'm not sure.
Closed. This question is off-topic. It is not currently accepting answers.                                            Want to improve this question Update the question so it's on-topic for Japanese Language Stack Exchange.                Closed 6 years ago.                        Improve this question                    I have always known that for a verb that ends with a く, the past/perfective form ends with いた and the conjugative form ends with いて.But today I found in Wiktionary that there are alternative perfective forms 抱った/抱って for 抱く and 書った/書って for 書く.Are those simply typo/mistake in Wiktionary or could there be some truths in themScreenshot:
I have this question in my JLPT practise book:明日{あした}は雨{あめ}が降{ふ}りそうな_____がする。A 予報{よほう} 　B 予知{よち} 　C 予感{よかん}　D 予測{よそく}I chose A, mostly because of seeing 予報{よほう}  used a lot when talking about weather. The dictionary backs me up on that by defining it as "forecast."But the book says the answer is C. Is this because the use of そう means that the prediction of tomorrow's weather is a vague feeling 予感{よかん} seems to me a sort of vague notion.I'm not clear on this, because I thought そう could mean "appear" in a more neutral sense, in which case, 予報{よほう} should fit just as well, shouldn't it
I often see 手{て}, hand, used in a metaphorical sense to mean something along the lines of effort or presence... but I'm not totally sure.For example, consider this sentence:手を[抜]{ぬ}いて仕事{しごと}をしていたら、部長{ぶちょう}に怒{おこ}られた。手{て}を抜{ぬ}く appears to be a set phrase, meaning, "to slack off."However, I'm trying to get at exactly what the 手{て} refers to. When I first read this sentence, I thought that if one pulled one's "hand" out, then one simply wasn't doing the work.What it seems to mean instead, though, is that one is still going to do the work, but not put in an effort.Is it accurate to say, then, that 手{て}, when used metaphorically, usually refers to "effort" Would the sentence mean the same thing if it was written like this:努力{どりょく}しなくて仕事{しごと}をしていたら、部長{ぶちょう}に怒{おこ}られた。
In my JLPT practise book, there is this question:子供{こども}のけんかに親{おや}が_____きた。A 乗{の}り越{こ}えて 　B 乗{の}り切{き}って　C 乗{の}り出{だ}して　 D 踏{ふ}み込{こ}んでI chose D, because it seemed to me that the meaning of 踏{ふ}み込{こ}んで means to "bust in on". As in, interrupt the kids who are fighting.However, the book says the answer is C, which seems odd to me because I thought 乗{の}り出{だ}して meant something like "to set out to do X". Since the sentence doesn't seem to me to contain the X action the parents set out to do, it looks incomplete to me.So I must not understand the use of 乗{の}り出{だ}して.What would be an accurate translation of the sentence, and what exactly is 乗{の}り出{だ}して
In my JLPT practise book, there is a section demonstrating the difference between なぐる, たたく, 打{う}つ, and ぶつ. If I understand them, they are all variants of "hit", with subtle nuances to differentiate them.I have this example explaining the use of ぶつ:いたずらをした子供{こども}は、母親{ははおや}にお尻{しり}をぶたれた。And then I have this question:なまけ者{もの}の弟{おとうと}は人{ひと}から尻{しり}を_____ないと、なかなか仕事{しごと}をしない。A　ぶたれ 　B　たたかれ 　C　打{う}たれ 　D　なぐられI chose A, which means I fell unto the usual JLPT trap where they deliberately mislead with similar contexts. D'oh!Still, in any case, I can't see why B is a better answer.　In fact, the subtleties of difference make me unsure why any of them are not appropriate.What makes B the right answer, and the rest wrong
In my JLPT workbook, it gives these examples to explain the difference between 延{の}びる and 伸{の}びる:髪{かみ}は[１]{いっ}か[月]{げつ}に１センチぐらい伸{の}びる。会議{かいぎ}はいつも30分{ぷん}ぐらい延{の}びる。They both mean "stretch", more or less, so I assumed the difference was that 延{の}びる was more about time and space, and 伸{の}びる is more about distance and length.However, take a look at this practise question:１９７２年、東京{とうきょう}から大阪{おおさか}までだった東海道{とうかいどう}新幹線{しんかんせん}は岡山{おかやま}まで____________。A　長引{ながひ}いた 　B　広{ひろ}がった 　C　延{の}びた 　D　伸{の}びたI chose, D, because it was about length.According to the book, though, the answer is C.How can I make sense of this answer in light of the example sentences
I often hear Japanese using a different method for saying a number like "248" as によんぱ — especially for highways and license plates.  While this one is easy to understand, there are others that I don't quite understand.Could someone provide a list of the different pronunciations of each number  "2525" being ニコニコ is probably a good example of what I'm talking about.  1:い  2:に  3:  4:よん  5:こ  6:  7:  8:は、ぱ  9:
When we first studied adjective conjugation in my Japanese class, I kept making the same mistake habitually; I would conjugate the past tense of い-adjectives with でした at the end instead of dropping the い and adding かったです. My teacher would correct me, and now I've more or less started doing かったです, but I still wonder about how "wrong" adjective-でした is.○ あのテストは難しかったです。× あのテストは難しいでした。Is the second sentence straight out wrong and/or extremely unnatural-sounding Would anybody in Japan conjugate adjectives like this Or does it possibly introduce a slightly different meaning
I've just learned that ～わけにはいけない as in 断{ことわ}るわけにはいけない ("I can't refuse") apparently isn't valid but ～わけにはいかない is, even though I've been using the former frequently. But what is the difference between いかない and いけない and when should they each be used Also, is (te form)はいかない valid I'm guessing ～してはいかない isn't valid but ～してはいけない is. Is うまくいけない or 納得いけない valid In English I think "this can't go well" or "I can't tolerate that" sounds like it would work, but I'm not sure it would in Japanese.
Inspired by this question of rounded or circular strokes in kanji, I got an idea to prove that there is no circular strokes in kanji by examining all kanji radicals, which is a lot less that examining all kanji characters.But that would work only if kanji characters are made up of radicals only, and would not work if kanji characters could contain strokes that are not part of the list of all radicals.So, are kanji characters made up of radicals only or can they contain strokes that are not radicals
Why is は used at the end of こんにちは Is the last letter the particle は, or is there a different explanationWhich is correct: こんばんわ or こんばんは mentions konnichiwa, but the question is interpreted more as "When should I use こんばんわ and when should I use こんばんは"
I could not help but notice that adjectives cannot directly conjugate to have a potential form:E.g. 赤い does not become 赤られる for (can be red)(Question) Which of the below are acceptable forms to convey a potential for adjectives What about な-adjectives:赤く出来る (using potential-form of する)赤くなれる (using potential-form of なる) (This seems to mean "can become red" which is so very different from "can be red")EDIT: 赤いがなり得る (I found this construction, I'm not sure what it does and how different it is from 赤くなれる and 赤くなり得る)赤いことができる　(Using the sentence pattern ～ことができる)I also thought about using the copula but there isn't any potential form for だ/です. Unless it's であられるWould 赤いであられる make sense for "can be red"
In this quote by Akihiro Miwa, 「そんな～ことはありません」 isn't used the way I'd expect it to be:努力{どりょく}をしない人も[平等]{びょうどう}になどと、そんなバカなことはありません。  It's (extremely) foolish to treat people who don't make an effort equally.I think 「そんな～ことはありません」 is used for emphasis here, but is using negation in this way common and how does "there aren't those kind of foolish things" become "extremely foolish"
Forgive me if this question seems foolish, but perhaps curiosity has gotten the best of me 'cause I am asking away. Every time I sit down to practice some good ol' kanji writing, I can't help but notice the lack of rounded shapes, circles, spheres, etc.. Sure, there are some curved strokes, but even in words that speak of "circular" and "rounded" things (丸、円...), there is nothing remotely "round" in the kanji to speak of. I know very little about the etymology of kanji, so perhaps I am embarrassing myself by asking this question. However, I am curious to know -- were there ever circular strokes in kanji What's the story, if there is one at all...
Is the pronunciation of 対応済 たいおうすみ or たいおうずみ Context: SoftwareExample:ユーザが押したときに問題が起こらないように対応済
Sorry if this is really simple and I'm overlooking the obvious, but I'm not sure how the following sentence should be translated as I've noticed on previous occasions that the word 「心配{しんぱい}」 might be used in a vague or ambiguous way:各国{かくこく}で地震{じしん}が起{お}きているのでオーストラリアも心配{しんぱい}です。I can think of three possibilities:There are earthquakes occurring in many countries, so there are also concerns that one will occur in Australia.There are earthquakes occurring in many countries, so Australia is also concerned that one will occur.There are earthquakes occurring in many countries, so I'm concerned that one will also occur in Australia.Also, when should 「心配」 by itself be used instead of 「心配しています」 etc, as I think both phrases can be translated to "(I'm) worried" and "(I'm) concerned" in English
Does anybody have a clue what こまけー might mean Below are some sentences for context and the phrase as it's used:まじめでおカタい感じの女子大生は、やたらとわたしを目を敵にしてきた。わたしが何をやっても文句をつけてくる。「しょうゆの向きは、こうじゃなくてこう！」って こまけー んだよ!
震災で家族を亡くしたOtoyaは、売られた奉公先で暴行されそうになったところを、家の跡取りである一威(Kazui)に助けられる.I was thinking that since 暴行 can be a する verb, that maybe され had something to do with that, but I'm really not sure. Can someone explain
I've noticed there's a lot of overlap between the following words meaning "earnest" or "serious" when talking about a person:まじ真面目{まじめ}真剣{しんけん}本気{ほんき}正気{しょうき}: (This word really means "sane" I believe, but I'm including it as I think 「正気か？」 can translate to "are you serious")素直{すなお}: (I'm not sure whether this word meaning "honest" belongs here I but keep wondering what it's relationship to 真面目{まじめ} is when it means "obedient". I thought there might be some overlap in it's usage, e.g. 「素直な顔」 "obedient face" and 「真面目な顔」 "serious face". It could well be unrelated though.)Would I be allowed to ask what the differences between these words are and when they're used
I'd like to expose my young children to the sounds of Japanese at night as they go to sleep.Specifically, I'd like to play Japanese lullabies or other soothing music with vocals. Where do I find such music
On a certain online correction site, my sentence:正直に言うと、最近アメリカのドラマを観ていたばかり。Was given many possibilities. Some people crossed out 「ばかり」 like 「観ていたばかり」 in the following sentences so I'm inclined to think I might've been wrong:正直に言うと、最近アメリカのドラマを観てばかりいた。  正直に言うと、最近アメリカのドラマばかりを観ていた。  正直な話、最近はアメリカのドラマばかり観ていた。One of the answerers also wrote the same ending as I did though, so I'm slightly confused:正直、最近アメリカのドラマを観ていたばかり。Is there a reason why there's so many usages of 「ばかり」, and is one or more of these more "correct" than the others or are they somehow arbitrary
After reading numerous publications, I've spotted a trend or custom on determining whether kanji is or is not used for certain words. The most obvious ones are:こと・事…が実は犯人だったということがわかる。(haven't found a sentence which uses 事 alone yet)ほう・方…事前に連絡したほうがいいだろう。…彼の方が優秀である。とき・時…を実施したとき、企業の声は…その時が来たら、また私に…And there are other words of which, the usage of kanji is avoided. I may want to ask which is preferrable for each of the situation above, but in another question. What I want to ask here is:QuestionDo publishers/writers employ a certain guideline/reference for selecting kanji when writing for public reading If so, who governs the guideline Is there a publication describing it
The verb 触れる challenges my concept of what を does; to mark a direct object.Consider these uses of 触れる:（人）の頬に指を触れる (Touch a finger to someone's cheek)（人）の頬に手を触れる (Touch someone's cheek with your hand)Now, if transitivity of the verb were not taken into account, I would guess that it's the finger or hand that is being touched since they are marked by the direct object marker を. But because I know that 触れる is intransitive, I understand that the object is marked by に instead.(Question) What is the role of を when used in the above type of pattern Should the particle be で instead since 指/手 are the "means" by which the action was carried out
I am trying to understand the difference between using いえ and うち. I originally drew the conclusion that うち is used for your own house and いえ for others' houses, but my Japanese teacher said that this is not always true (but did not explain how to use each...).What is the correct usage of いえ and うち What difference is implied by using one instead of the other
In English when you hold out something to someone, sometimes a vocal prompt like "here" or "there" is said to indicate that you are giving it to the person.In Chinese (or at least in Singapore) we sometimes use something that sounds like "na" or even use the Chinese word "给(gěi)" as an expression while holding out something towards the recipient.EDIT: Perhaps I should have been more specific about what I'm referring to. I'm not referring to giving "gifts", but just giving in general. Something like just passing a note to somebody or when someone looks in need of a tissue and you just hold it out to them.(Question) What's the equivalent of this concept in Japanese I ask because I think it feels quite awkward to either remain silent, or to form a complete sentence asking the person to receive it especially if you are familiar with the person.
I don't know how to intentionally write the kanji that way, but on my ubuntu system 強い sometimes gets rendered that way.What I'd like to know first if it's incorrect or if it's some rare but still valid way to write it. I went through all the kanji in my jisho that featured 弓 but none of them matched the weird tsuyoi.Secondly I'd be interested in if anyone had any explanation for why it's rendered like thisMy personal guess is that it has something to do with the fonts or something.
what does もういわない meanI got this message from someone and i dont think it means what I think...
語学学習は私の新しい習慣の一部になりつつあるのでしょうか？"Is learning languages becoming a part of my new daily routine"なりつつある here seems similar to なっている... are they often interchangeable Would I be able to change them back and forth without changing the meaning of this sentence muchThis is my first contact with this suffix so if anyone has warnings about its usages or beginner's mistakes, please feel free to espouse.wwwjdic defines つつある as :to be doing; to be in the process of doinghttp://nhg.pro.tok2.com/qa/kousei-7.htm
In a report I handed in earlier this week, my professor corrected my sentence to日本において、金融政策の目的に関する考え方が時間を伴い、変わってきた。from 「に伴い」. Is there a practical difference between the two ALC shows a bunch of examples with essentially identical usage.Here's the definition from 大辞林：一緒に行く。引き連れて行く、またつき従って行く。「秘書を伴って行く」「父に伴って博物館に行く」ある事柄に応じて生ずる。「危険を伴う手術」「人口増加に伴う住宅問題」It seems like に and を are being used interchangeably. Is there a rule of thumb for when to use which
Here is a snippet of text from a JLPT(N1) question:「俺{おれ}は料理{りょうり}が得意{とくい}なんだ」と自慢{じまん}げに語{かた}る男性{だんせい}の頭{あたま}に、素材{そざい}の値段{ねだん}やかかる時間{じかん}、そして誰{だれ}が後{あと}片付{かたづ}けをするか、などという問題{もんだい}は存在{そんざい}しません。あくまで趣味{しゅみ}なのですから、高価{こうか}な肉{にく}や滅多{めった}に使{つか}わない香辛料{こうしんりょう}を駆使{くし}し、無駄{むだ}をいっぱい出{だ}しながら料理{りょうり}するのです。そして使{つか}い散{ち}らかされた道具{どうぐ}を洗{あら}うのは、奥{おく}さんだったりする。And here is the related question:筆者{ひっしゃ}は男性{だんせい}の料理{りょうり}をどう思{おも}っているか。1　無駄{むだ}な努力{どりょく}である。2　家族{かぞく}を満足{まんぞく}させている。3　実用的{じつようてき}ではない。4　自立{じりつ}のために不可欠{ふかけつ}だ。I chose answer 1.However, according to the book, the correct answer is 3. But I just don't see where the issue of practicality, 実用的{じつようてき} is made clear within the text.Also, isn't saying something is impractical another way of saying that the effort is useless, as in 無駄{むだ}な努力{どりょく} Is the distinction being made a subtle one, or am I not seeing something obvious in front of my faceWhy exactly is 3 the correct answerPlease note: I am hoping that someone can point out the specific key words and phrases that I should be focusing on in order to help me see the meaning, not just summarize what the text is saying. I'm trying to understand the language of the text in the question, not just it's premise. Thanks!
Observe the change:彼女は行かないと思う。 "I think that she will not go"彼女は行くまいと思う。 "She thinks that she will not go"彼女は and と思う are conserved in the sentence, yet the person who is doing the thinking is different.(Question 1) Is the use of the negative volitional form the direct cause of the change(Question 2) How do I make specific the person who is doing the thinking in each case I.e. How do I express "I think that she will not go" using 行くまい and "She thinks that she will not go" using 行かない

For usernames, etc., you usually see like ユーザ名 or something similar.  Or like on my Skype, it says Skype名.  How is the 名 pronounced in these situations  I've never been able to conclusively find this anywhere.  My instinct tells me it's な because these seem like compounds nouns (like 星空【ほしぞら】, etc.) that use kun-yomi.
What's the difference between 「この辺{へん}」 and 「この辺{あた}り」I used to always read 「この辺{へん}」as 「この辺{あたり}」 as I thought it would be confused with 「変{へん}」 but it apparently is different.

Closed 8 years ago.(If the question is inappropriate here, please direct me to an appropriate site or forum)In an effort to simplify the acquisition of pitch in L2 learners (ie. myself), I created a pdf document that groups verb endings and morphemes into more manageable groups: Verb Pitch Table.However, reliable data is difficult to establish. Can anyone confirm that the data is accurate for Standard or Tokyo JapaneseI asked 2 Japanese speakers (1 quickly, 1 in detail) and it seems okay. The only problem is that some of the data conflicts with what I found in my NHK Accent dictionary. For instance, after accentless verbs, でしょう、だろう、らしい are said to have pitch on the antepenultimate mora, but this was thought to be odd by the speakers I asked；とも is said to be HL but the one speaker thought it should be H]LL (downfall occurs before). My goal is to create a quick and easy reference for anyone wanting to sound like the average speaker of the Greater Tokyo Area. I realize the question is complex, but I hope to provide an efficient method to help learner predict pitch in all verbs with the help of a simple all-encompassing tool.
This comes from a friend's post on Facebook. The situation is that my friend had injured his leg a while back, but it has since healed and he's now in for a checkup. His leg is in great condition, so the doctor thinks he's ready for sports.先生{せんせい}には「もうフットサルして来{こ}い」と言{い}われた！Which I think essentially means, "My doctor said [to me] I should go play futsal! (lit: play and come back)"However, I thought には essentially meant "in the [place]". So, since my friend is not just using に, is he saying this was said by someone, maybe the doctor, maybe a nurse or someone, in the vicinity of the doctor Maybe in the officeOr am I over thinking this
This sentence comes from my JLPT practise book:宗教{しゅうきょう}とは何{なん}か、迷信{めいしん}とは何{なん}かを正確{せいかく}に定義{ていぎ}するのは困難{こんなん}だ。I think it's basically saying:Things like religions and supersitions are hard to define accurately.However, I get a sense that there is a comparison being made. Is the sentence simply saying that religions and superstitions are both hard to define, or that it is hard to define religions and superstitions as different from each other
I have this sentence as part of a question in my JLPT practise book:スリのグループがボスの合図{あいず}で乗客{じょうきゃく}から金{かね}を盗{ぬす}むのを目{ま}の当{あ}たりにして恐{おそ}ろしかった。Part of the sentence means, "the pickpocket group steals money from the passengers from the signal given by the boss," and part of the sentence means "being face to face is scary."I presume it's the boss's eyes that are scary, but I can't make this sentence come together.What would be the best translation for this sentence What is the underlying structure that binds it together
What's the difference between 「うまく」, 「上手に」 and 「よく」, all seemingly meaning "well" in EnglishSomeone said that I should use 「よく」 rather than 「うまく」 in the following sentence. Can anyone explain whyこの文の意味は　うまく　よく　分からなかった。I'd really like to know the difference between the 3 words, or maybe just some examples of where one is more suitable than another if possible.Edit: Doing some digging through many e-mails, it turns out it wasn't 「うまく」 vs 「上手に」 at all as in the original question, but I think the other person clearly preferred 「上手」 over 「うまい」:～さんのクラフトは うまそう 上手。
I am in the process of publishing a book on verse, more particularly, "American Haiku and Senryu -- 1008 Pauses Along the Path" and I need to ascertain whether or not the title is appropriate, i.e. is the inclusion of the word Senryu necessaryDoes Haiku cover the following   (The first chapter contains traditional Haiku verse; the remainder of 5-7-5 form deals with non-nature, politics, man and woman and various observations.)  Again, I wish to acknowledge the correct way to entitle the content.
I have recently seen 「やってもた」 used in a Japanese conversation, I don't remember the context exactly, but it was something like：久々にやってもた。After asking my Japanese friend, it turns out to be some kind of Osaka-ben expression used instead of 「やってしまった」, where the 「も」 stands for 「しまう」. My friend couldn't give me another use of this so I'm here asking two questions:Is my explanation of 「やってもた」 accurateCan we extract from this example a generic grammatical rule that can be applied to most situation I seek to learn Osaka-ben and I'm trying to replace my old habits, so I would be very grateful if you can provide some external resources about this or at least mention your sources.
I often get text messages from people who use the twitter-derived slang 「なう」 to mean "now." As in 「電車なう」meaning "(I am on the) train now."However, these mainly come from women, and one gay dude. Is that just a coincidence, or does using this term actually have some feminine/effeminate connotation, like appending わ for emphasis (e.g. 「疲れたわ〜」)
What does あらいだす mean I have been hearing it from my colleague and based on his explanation it means to identify. For example identify the problem. I tried to search the net and it only results to "Washout" 洗い出して{あらいだして}. Does anyone know what this mean if it really is identify.

I have this sentence in one of my JLPT practise books:電子{でんし}レンジは冷{さ}めた料理{りょうり}を温{あたた}めるのに重宝{ちょうほう}だ。I thought のに meant something like "in spite of". So, to me, this sentence seems to be saying that a microwave oven is convenient (or a "precious treasure") in spite of the fact that it warms cold food.... but, isn't that exactly what a microwave oven is supposed to do Shouldn't the sentence be something more like:電子{でんし}レンジは冷{さ}めた料理{りょうり}を温{あたた}めるので重宝{ちょうほう}だ。Is this a typo, or is のに used in another way that make sense here
I recently heard about a manga entitled つっぱしり元太郎, and I'm slightly confused about the meaning of the 「つっぱしり」 in its name. I've looked the word up in several dictionaries, but have gotten no results.From what I know and have seen, it seems that it is derived from the verb [突っ走る]{つっぱしる} (which would make sense given the apparent nature of the manga.)Thus my question is: What is 「つっぱしり」 in this context Is it an independent noun or adjective (if so, what is its meaning), or is it grammatical-form derived from the aforementioned verb (if so, what is the grammar behind it)
For example :日本語を勉強します.Do you pronounce ni hon go wo or ni hon go---
I only know the 2 meanings of it as follow:Use when thinking - no meaningUse to agree with others - the meaning is like "yes, I think so"What else and what situation can it be usedIf someone ask me "これはあなたの財布ですか？”, Can I answer 「そうですね」Is it strange　or Is it better to answer without 「ね」
Someone has said this in my manga.まず！我らの使命は２つ！！Does he actually say "two" or "に" If the latter, why not use 二 I don't see 二つ as being any different.
Consider this sentence:それは三十年前のことだから、もう[fill in the blank]。The answer given by the workbook is 忘れた.Choices are:忘れる (forget)忘れた (forgot)忘れている (continued state of forgetting)忘れていた (had forgotten, currently may or may not be forgotten)My thought process:Choice 1 is ruled out because it is present/future tense, but the question describes something in the past.Choice 3 cannot make sense to me. If one is able to talk about something that one forgets, the person is currently not forgetting it. (I do not see how this can make sense in the first person) (Unless it's a dynamic state of memory where the person keeps forgetting and recalling bits and pieces)Choice 4 was my choice. I don't understand why 2 is correct while 4 is not. I thought 4 to be correct because he had forgotten about the issue, but is currently remembering it while making the statement.(Question) Why is choice 2 correct and 4 wrong And under what circumstances do we use 3
やる時{とき}やるじゃん！  (Yaru toki yaru jan!)I think the meaning is something like "When you want to do something, you do it".Or maybe, "When you are about to do something, you just do it."This is a positive expressionDoes it mean you have confidence in what you do Or that you do it without thinking firstThanks!

I have read several definitions of だって but none of them seem to make sense when I see it at the beginning of a sentence and I read the context. I saw one example Japanese sentence and in the English translation だって wasn't translated into anything.So what is だって when it's at the beginning of a sentence
They both mean "Can you/I eat"So can they be used interchangeablyI know that the て-form is used when speaking a command to someone so is it a more direct() form of asking a question Like asking a question to someone who is superior to you
When composing sentences in Japanese, the verb tends to be last right For example,バナナを食べました。 --&gt; I ate a bananaBut recently I came across a sentence where the verb was at the beginning of the the sentence. 折れた淡い翼。How is this possible 「折れた」 means "broken; bended," would it translate as " broken fleeting wings"This is the first line in a song that I am trying to translate. The first verse is as follows:折れた淡い翼きみは少し青すぎる空につかれただけさもう誰かのためじゃなくて自分のために笑っていいよI am not worried about the translation but rather why the verb is in the beginning of the sentence and why there is no need for 「を」.Thank you!
I'm talking about the 曰 from 曰【いわ】く, not the common 日【ひ】 we all know and love.Why would they "make" two characters that look (for all intents and purposes) exactly the sameHow do you really differentiate them except by context  曰 just looks like a ずんぐりした 日.  Presumably the stroke order is the same  Because I haven't been able to find it anywhere.  What would you have to do when actually writing it to make sure it's not mistakable  It looks like the middle line of 曰 intentionally doesn't go all the way across.I simultaneously love and hate this character.  Any insight into its mysterious existence is appreciated.
I have a fuzzy understanding that っぷる is something like っぽい (-ish) or っぷり (manner, style). Could you offer a more clear definitionFor example someone eating salad for dinner says:貧乏っプルじゃないよ。ベジタブルっプルだよ。最近食べ過ぎで野菜をたくさん食べたくなるのよ。
I have a couple of questions about the volitional form of verbs that I've become unclear on lately.  Here is a Bible passage containing the grammar in question:(Note that I'm using a Bible passage as I have before because it directly relates to the topic.  I'm not trying to bring any spiritual discussions into this post.)「主{しゅ}の名を呼び求める者はだれでも[救]{すく}われる」のです。ところで、信じたことのない[方]{かた}を、どうして呼び求められよう。聞いたことのない方を、どうして信じられよう。また[宣]{の}べ伝{つた}える人がなければ、どうして聞くことができよう。[遣]{つか}わされないで、どうして[宣]{の}べ[伝]{つた}えることができよう。　ー　ローマの[信徒]{しんと}への手紙 10[章]{しょう}:13-15[節]{せつ}As the scripture says, "Everyone who calls out to the Lord for help will be saved."  But how can they call to him for help if they have not believed  And how can they believe if they have not heard the message  And how can they hear if the message is not proclaimed  And how can the mesage be proclaimed if the messengers are not sent out - Romans 10:13-15So, my questions are:How does the volitional form work in this type of rhetorical question (without a か I might add)  Would the same meaning come across if these questions simply ended in 辞書形＋か (like どうして信じられるか)Can Verb-意志形 always be replaced by Verb-辞書形＋でしょう／だろう in this type of question  Because substituting that into these questions seems to make a little more sense to me.  どうして信じられるでしょう　→　"How can they (possibly) believe"Of course, it does not make sense that you could substitute it when Verb-意志形 means "let's do X".  (あとで外食しよう　→　"Let's go out to eat later", is clearly different than あとで外食するでしょう　→　"We'll probably go out to eat later")
The word "should" in English has these uses when not used as a question:To express the expectation of the speaker (Probabilistic reasoning).The train should arrive in 10 minutes.To express a conditionShould it rain, the event will be cancelled.To express obligation or the duty of ~.I should go home. You should study hard for the exam.To indicate an ideal state perceived by the speaker.Everyone should have equal rights.From my understanding, I use ~はず for 1., ~ば(or other conditionals) for 2., and ~べき for 3. .(Question) What can I use for 4.
I've looked in many dictionaries, but I can't fully grasp how the word [苦]{く}[笑]{しょう} is used. I've seen it in dictionaries as being a kind of "embarrassed laugh". It appears to be used to deprecate the speaker and others or point out ridiculousness, but I see it used in all sorts of ways that may amount to a kind sarcasm. Can this word amount to a form of sarcasm, and what is the cultural significance of this word Is it used in different ways by men vs women Is it primarily used in the written language, or is it also spoken in conversationAlso, what's the difference between [苦]{にが}[笑]{わら}い and 苦笑Some examples of it being used:急{きゅう}に厳{きび}しくなってきた (苦笑)お迎{むか}え待{ま}ち中{ちゅう} (苦笑)外{がい}部{ぶ}被{ひ}曝{ばく}受{う}けてきました (苦笑)

I've seen a few sets of terminology when referring to the causative form, so for the basic case, I will use the following:instigator が agent に 〇〇 を ｖ－させる。In its most basic, text-book form, we have sentences such as:子供にお弁当を買わせます。  後輩にビールを飲ませます。Additionally, most textbooks mention something along the lines of [intransitive verbs or verbs that do not call for を] have an agent marked with を。(sorry for the ad-hoc bracketing, but it was hard to parse beforehand)先生が私をトイレに行かせました。  その人が私をそこに座らせました。If I use 行く with another verb as its purpose, is を available to mark the agent It seems like this should be the case since お弁当を should be connected to 行く。Compare:[a] 子供にお弁当を買いに行かせます。  [b] 子供をお弁当を買いに行かせます。With intransitive verbs, must I use を to mark the agent Compare:[a]その人は私をそこに座らせました。  [b]その人は私にそこに座らせました。If I leave off the object of a transitive verb due to ellipses, may I mark the agent with を (This seems strange, but I figured I'd ask.)  Compare:[a]子供に買わせました。  [b]子供を買わせました。If I use a transitive verb, but use を to mark something that is moved through or done with effort, may I still mark the agent with を Compare:[a]子供に道を行かせます。  [b]子供を道を行かせます。  [c]彼に私のことを分からせます。  [d]彼を私のことを分からせます。I've also heard mention that some speakers occasionally use を to mark the agent with intransitive verbs without any further details. Is this something that a seemingly random group of people does Is it due to dialectal variation Is there a pattern to when it can be done Is there a difference in nuanceIn the cases where I can choose between marking the agent with を or に, is there any difference in nuance In a fairly old grammar, I've read that using に may soften the statement a little.For each question with example sentences, I'm primarily concerned with a few things:Is this permissible (would it sound incorrect in conversation look incorrect in writing)What would a native speaker usually doOf course I also welcome any information about dialectal variation, language change, etc!

I was driving the other day and saw a truck with 一般 written as 般一 on the drivers side door.  My wife was telling me that this is often the case with trucks, where it is actually written from right to left in 縦 style, as if there was only 1 row.  Just was wondering if there was a particular reason for it or if this is limited to just trucks or can this be found elsewhere.Of note, it was NOT written flipped so as to be seen correctly when looked at through a mirror like ambulances and such in the U.S.Note:This question is on the border in terms of being off-topic, but since it is referring to language use within Japanese culture, I felt it was appropriate to ask.Examples of texthttp://septieme-ciel.air-nifty.com/nikubanare/2005/09/post_5b58.html
In my JLPT practise book, there is this question:その国王{こくおう}は戦{たたか}いに負{ま}け____の一部{いちぶ}を失{うしな}ってしまった。Which I roughly translate as, "The kingdom lost a part of its __ in the battle."The possible answers to fill the space are:A 領域{りょういき} (territory)B 領土{りょうど} (territory)C 占領{せんりょう} (occupation)D 領収{りょうしゅう} (receipt)Both A and B are defined as "territory" and a lot of other overlapping words. So, going by the kanji, I figured 領土{りょうど} was more to do with the physical land, and 領域{りょういき} was more to do with the dominion. So my answer was A.The book, though, says the correct answer is B.As is usually the case with JLPT questions, both could work, but what makes 領土{りょうど} the more appropriate answer in this case
For instance, "He is eating" is "Kare wa tabete iru". However, "He is dying" is not "Kare wa shinde iru". Another example is "He is going to Japan" is not "Kare wa nihon ni itte iru". So if I can't use the "te iru" form to express an action currently in progress for verbs like shinu, iku, kuru, then what would be correct way to make those sentences

I'm currently reading The Tale of Peter Rabbit in Japanese, but the opening to the story is confusing me a bit.The actual text reads:[昔々]{むかしむかし}あるところに、四[匹]{ひき}の小さなウサギがいました。彼らの[名前]{なまえ}はプロプシー、モプシー、コットンテールとピーターです。 As you can see, the first sentence is in the past tense, but the second seems to be in the present. Double checking several English versions of the text, they all have both in the past tense; and in general switching tenses in English is frowned upon.Now, I know that Japanese treats tenses differently from English, but this seems odd to me. Thus, my question is: Can you switch tenses like this in Japanese, and if so, what (extra) nuances (if any) does it carryThanks!

Closed 9 years ago.I have come to the conclusion that to the beginner it is useful to equate the particle は with the article ‘the’ in English. Even more so for a Swedish speaker since the Swedish article is an ending. A difference is that we say あなたは but not “the you”. However あなたは is short for an old あの方 and not a true pronoun. Similar ways of avoiding a true ‘thou’ were common in Sweden 50 years ago (and forced an article). English examples are rarer but we can say “the other side” instead of “they” when referring to another political party. Thus I propose は as the definite form nominative case ending and が as the indefinite form nominative case ending.On the whole I think that the distinction between Japanese postpositions and endings in Germanic languages is misleading. Why is の a postposition and ‘s an ending Presently I see は, が, の and を as case endings and I would appreciate to see examples where it does not work out.
I found this sentence on a video game review site:日本だと「不思議のダンジョン」と言ったほうがわかりやすいかもしれないローグライクゲーム。I am not sure whether だと means 'in Japan' or 'if it were in Japan'. The translation in one case would be:This is a rogue-like game that, in Japan, is called 'Amazing Dungeons' which is probably a bit easier to understand. A rogue-like game is a genre of video game which is similar to the original of the genre, Rogue. The other option which I personally think is more likely is:This is a rogue-like game which if made in Japan would probably be called something more easy to understand like 'Amazing Dungeons'" It boils down to me not knowing the だと construction. Can someone be kind enough to explain this usage to me

I was writing to my japanese friends, and I got some doubts.Hope it wasn't asked here before.How can I express "what about ..." in Japanese Particularly:What about having some breaks  What about doing it on Mondays and Tuesdays  What do you think about this sweater  What do you think if we go tomorrow  How about openning the windows  What if we move this chair to another place  ...I was thinking of:どうですか。  いかがですか。  よろしいですか。Is the following correct月曜日と火曜日するのはどうですか。
I have found that there are a number of words in Japanese that correspond to "heaven" in English. By heaven I mean the concept of a paradisiacal afterlife. The two most frequent in my limited and flawed personal experience are天国   (as well as just 天)  and  極楽 which I often find is useful to translate as "paradise"Offhand, and in my own (again flawed) way of thinking, I see 天国 see as a bit more austere, while 極楽 maybe has a more sensual feel. I associate 天国 more with native Japanese myths and religion (shintoism) while 極楽 has more of a buddhist feel (and thus not purely Japanese) as it is from the  Pure Land school of Buddhism. I am wondering if there are any other terms for heaven in wide use, and also about the different feel and nuance each word possesses. I am also interested in which word Japanese Christians use for Christian heaven, and indeed if practitioners of specific faiths discriminate in their vocabulary for heaven.
Supposing that you want to express a list of events or actions exhaustively and without significance in ordering (for example: Yesterday, I ate some ice cream, went to the store, and read a book, but those things weren't necessarily done in sequence), what are the possible grammar constructions that can be used These are some possibilities I've seen:て →　This seems too temporal to me; that is, it seems like all events are sequential. Can the て-form be used without time relations or restrictionsたり →　This seems like it would work, but I don't know how exhaustive it is, since it seems to imply somethings might have been left out.Stem (連用中止法) →　Not sure about this one. What is the proper way to use this I believe this is similar to the て-Form.そ(う)して →　I think this simple conjuction works, but it seems slightly tiresome if one is listing many actions.I hope this question isn't being too open. I'm just looking for some opinions and explanations for the different grammatical constructs that could be used in these types of expressions.
Topic.

I was in Bikku Camera earlier today, and I wanted to buy a small kitchen scale for measuring small amounts of food.I looked up the word "scale" in the dictionary, and it said 衡器{こうき}. So I found a shop assistant and asked her for a 食{た}べ物{もの}を量{はか}る用{よう}の衡器{こうき}. (I'm not totally confident about my grammar there, so correct me if I'm off. However, I don't think it changes the main point of this question.)She looked at me quizzically, so I asked again, and this time I said 食{た}べ物{もの}を量{はか}る用{よう}のスケール. This time she understood perfectly, and took me directly to where the scales were.I walked away from that interaction a little baffled. I can see how some words are more commonly understood in katakana 外来語{がいらいご}. For example, how 写真機{しゃしんき} got replaced by カメラ, being that it was a concept imported from the west and the English word came with it.But surely Japan had scales since forever, and there would be a native word. Is it not 衡器{こうき} I didn't find any viable alternatives in the dictionary.In any case, I'm always a little confused when I have to resort to katakana English to be understood. I feel like I'm cheating somehow. And I'm always surprised when it works.How, and why, is it that the shop assistant understood スケール better than 衡器{こうき}
In a comment, I've read 「目が見えないのは誰ですか」.I remember that, some 10 years ago, I was told that "の" could not replace human beings.  But here, since we use 誰, it's clearly a person that の refers to.Is my memory failing, or is the above sentence casual but not correct, so to speak
This is an exercise from Genki 1, Chapter 12.Now the way I would word that sentence is: 私{わたし}は日本{にほん}に勉強{べんきょう}しに行{い}きます。 However, I put that same [English] phrase in Google Translate and got this: 私は日本に[留学]{りゅうがく}つもりです。 So now I'm not sure which translation is correct. Since the exercise didn't specify, we'll assume that the person is studying the Japanese Language.So which one is correct My translation or Google's translation
Note: I understand this question is on the edge of being off topic. I'll accept the community assessement if enough people feel that is the case.I'm reading 脳{のう}は0.1秒{びょう}で恋{こい}をする by 茂木{もぎ}健一郎{けんいちろう}, and out of the blue, there's an English word right in the middle of a sentence:The sentence reads 人生{じんせい}は「偶有性{ぐうゆうせい}」(contingency)に満{み}ちています。 I think I basically understand it, in that it says life is full of contingencies.My question, though, is why is this English word here The book is written by and for Japanese. The way the word is offered, it looks as though it is a clarification of 偶有性{ぐうゆうせい}, where 偶有{ぐうゆう} means having an accident, and 性{せい} means the suffix ~ness, so I guess it's supposed to approximate the word "contingencies".I just don't get how this would help a Japanese person reading the book Does Mogi San expect that a Japanese person who doesn't know 偶有性{ぐうゆうせい} would be helped by knowing that it meant "contingencies" That doesn't seem very likely to me.I appreciated it, because it helped me understand what he meant, but I don't think this is for the benefit of Japanese learners.What is going on here
I noticed that in songs, the vowel sounds of the morae that come before geminations are sometimes repeated. For example, the first lyric line of “マジカルちょーだいっ” is sung as しらんぷりをしたあって where the line is actually しらんぷりをしたって.Another example: in the second lyric line of “片道きゃっちぼーる”, the final あった sounds like ああった.Also, at the beginning of the song “Gem Stone”, the repeated もってる is pronounced as もおってる.My questions are:Is this way of pronouncing gemination limited to songs, or are there instances where it's used elsewhereIt seems to be limited to songs with children or children-like voices, so is it by chance the way Japanese children initially pronounce gemination
Here's an example:みなさんに愛される人。Does this mean, "the person that everyone loves," or "the person that loves everybody"
Here's an example.メイドにはびびったWho was scared, the speaker, or the maid
I need to add a body to submit my question, so I'll just say the Mortal Kombat seemed to believe that the term 腹切り (はらきり harakiri) was more appropriate for self slaughter (i.e., throwing a boomerang hat that cuts one's own head off); however, I found 切腹 (せっぷく seppuku) used in many novels about Japanese samurai considering suicide due to some circumstance involving their master falling from grace.  Is the difference between the two whether it is over personal loss of face or clan-wide loss of face
Is it known why a さかや normally has a か, rather than a け like in さけAre there many other -や constructions for stores that change the spelling of the word added to
The other day I came across どうたら and while looking it up I noticed that たら is classified as a particle. どうたら is apparently an abbreviation of どうたらこうたら, so I see that it should work for ああ and そう (by the way, what are these called), but I'm having a hard time imagining how else it is used.
This is from the anime Noir, Episode 1 starting at 23:13 at the school:[The two characters A and B are leaving the country.]  A: 出国{しゅっこく}の手配{てはい}は済{す}ませた。  　'I've made the arrangements to leave the country.'  B: ありがとう。  My question is about the conjugation of 済ませた. I would have expected to hear: 済まして(い)た. I can't figure out what kind of conjugation that is. It looks like the potential form with iru, but I've never seen a past potential form. Plus, 'can finished' or 'can have finished' is much different than 'have finished'. So again, what kind of conjugation is 済ませた How is it formed
Nihonjin no Shiranai Nihongo (The Japanese language the Japanese people don't know) seems to be claiming, at around 6:20 of this YouTube clip of language-specific portions of episode 4 of the show, that desu and masu were endings geisha originally used, but that during the meiji period, samurai visiting geisha in Edo (nowadays Tokyo) misinterpreted it as part of Edo's dialect and spread it across the country.However, googling either for masu desu geisha, or teineigo (apparently a term that covers desu and masu) and geisha doesn't get any hits corroborating this claim, apart from pages citing Nihonjin no Shiranai Nihongo. Is this claim more amusing than backed up by factual evidence(Sections at or before 6:20 also has Haruko-sensei using terms translated as "standard Japanese" and "common Japanese", but I can't transcribe the original words)
There seems to be many different ways of saying either to agree or to disagree with a person.Which words are there, in what circumstances should they be used, and are there any relevant examples of their usageOne example is I'd like to be able to say "It's OK if you don't agree with me" but I don't know how to.(This is a spinoff question as I thought the original was getting too broad. For finer points and examples on using に同意する to agree/disagree with a person, see also How to use ～に同意する to agree or disagree with a person)
I'm preparing a sales presentation; it contains some company data and I want to indicate that the entire presentation is confidential.  In English, this would likely be accomplished by stamping the corner with "confidential".What's the best word to use in Japanese for a similar meaning  I've seen this somewhere in my old company, but I forgot... here are the candidates I know of, but the one I think I've seen before isn't there, I'm having trouble finding something where I say "aha that's it".内緒 (ないしょ)  -- more used as in "private", like a small secret between a few people秘密 (ひみつ  -- "secret", but not sure if this is the appropriate word機密 (きみつ）-- don't understand how this is different than 秘密親展 (しんてん) -- you see this on envelopes of letters, but that's about it
I am having difficulties to make sense of にすぎない, which is translated by EDICT to mean "no more than that; just; only". Is it not simply equivalent to だけ Can I use にすぎない as substitute for だけAlso, since かぎる means "to be restricted", which is opposite of すぎる - "to go beyond",  does it mean that にすぎない and にかぎらない are opposite of each other Can I use にかぎらない as substitute for だけじゃない
I would like to ask on how to avoid multiple occurrences of the particle ga in a sentence. For example:詳細{しょうさい}のクエリは削除{さくじょ}フラグが0がありません。What I meant in the sentence: The Detail query does not contain the condition of "delete-flag equals 0".Right now I would work around this by using equals symbol or change the verb like fukumemasen.詳細{しょうさい}のクエリは削除{さくじょ}フラグ＝0がありません。or詳細{しょうさい}のクエリは削除{さくじょ}フラグが0を含{ふく}めません。Is the original sentence's grammar correct If not, are my alternative sentences correct
(This question started as a dual question about when to drop vowels and whether it matters. The first question is well answered at What are the rules regarding "mute vowels" ("u" after "s" and "i" after "sh").)I'm just starting to learn Japanese, and one thing I've noticed is that vowel sounds--in particular, i and u--are often dropped by Japanese speakers. For example, "suki" is usually pronounced like the English word "ski", "desu" usually has the final "u" dropped, and I sometimes--but not always--hear "ichi" pronounced without the final "i" sound.My question is: how much does it matter whether you drop vowel sounds or not Will native speakers notice either way
"何" is pronounced as "なん" before counter-words like in "何時{なんじ}", "何歳{なんさい}" etc; or before particles like in "何で", "何とか" etc.However, it remains to be pronounced as "なに" in some words like "何事{なにごと}", "何色{なにいろ}", "何者{なにもの}" etc. It can also be pronounced both ways like in "何か".What is the logic/origin behind this pronunciation difference

Wikipedia says that 日本 can be pronounced either [にっぽん]{nippon} or [にほん]{nihon}.Does this ambiguity in pronunciation happen with other words If so, does it only happen with words that originated before handakuten (the circle symbol in ぱ ぴ ぷ ぺ ぽ) were added to the "p" sounding kana (By Portuguese missionaries, according to the tv series Nihonjin no Shiranai Nihongo, at 5:00 of the link)(Nihon and nippon has slightly different nuances according to the article, but that's not what I'm interested in)

A debate came up on the use of タメ語{ご} in this question, and I thought it was worth its own analysis.The question is, does タメ語 simply mean "casual speech", or does it mean "speech between equals". Or something else.The difference has implications for whether or not it might be rude in some situations. For instance, asking an older or more experienced person to use タメ語 instead of 敬語{けいご} might be rude if you're implying you are equals, but might be okay if it just means to use everyday language.The original debate had two native speakers disagreeing (which should be a note to all those who hold native speaking ability as the be-all-and-end-all of authority), so to settle this we'll need convincing references.
Based off sawa's comment from this question:"you cannot have two ...に phrases. Remove either."And using the same verb "同意する", I looked up the dictionary and found:1.（人）に同意する - to agree with a person2.（意見・提案・計画など）に同意する - to agree with an opinion/suggestion/plan/etc.Let's say I agree with a person about an opinion/suggestion/plan that does not necessarily belong to that person. This way I'm not using the genitive-の to connect the parts together as in (人)の(意見・提案・計画)に同意する. Instead I'm trying to express that I agree with a person with something.Deducing from the above dictionary excerpt, I would form a sentence with two にs (Which I now know is wrong from sawa's comment).Flawed (pun　not intended) attempts at constructing the sentence:ｘ 私は計画に彼に同意しますｘ この計画が彼に同意します　(I just realised that this means "This plan agrees with him" (Unless sarcasm is taken into consideration, this sentence cannot make any sense))(Question) What would be the proper way to construct this sentence
In the context of restaurants, convenience stores and similar situations, is it ok for a customer to ask for something that was said in keigo (or in manual keigo) to be repeated in more "normal" Japanese Or would staff rather speak in English rather than non-keigo JapaneseAssume the customer is not asking because they want to be more intimate, but because the customer (an obviously non-native speaker) hasn't learnt Japanese in its entirety yet.
A couple of times I've tried to say "I agree with..." or "he agrees with..." but I don't know whether I'm using 同意{どうい}する correctly.In what ways should に同意{どうい}している be used Also, which particles should be used Can only に be used before 同意{どうい}する or are there circumstances where other particles are used as well, such as と and をIn many examples I've found using 同意{どうい}する, I've seen （だ）ということに or just （な）ことに (the だ/な after na adjectives/nouns and without だ/な after i adjectives/verbs it seems.) Is there a specific reason for using one over the other, e.g. is the longer （だ）ということに more polite, and what do these meanSome example sentences:I agree with his opinion: 彼{かれ}の意見{いけん}に同意{どうい}します。I agree with him that oranges are tasty: オレンジはおいしいということ彼{かれ}に同意{どうい}します。He agrees that apples are tasty: 彼{かれ}はりんごがおいしいことに同意{どうい}します。Many people agree that brussel sprouts don't taste nice: 芽{め}キャベツはおいしくないということに同意{どうい}する人{ひと}が多{おお}い。See also: What are the different ways of saying to agree or disagree with a person for other ways of agreeing/disagreeing with someone.
The difference between が and を with the potential form of a verb. and Is it true that all nouns must be able to accept a が particle and a を particle are noted as possible duplicates; however, I haven't seen an analogous structure.  The examples I have seen use a verb on the right-hand side, rather than an adjectivial noun.Please compare two sentences:このかばんが好きです。andこのかばんをすきです。Both are correct, right  Is このかばん emphasized in the sooner sentence and すき emphasized in the latter sentences  Or are these sentences completely the same  Or is there something else going onPlease, feel free to just explain the difference.

(Warning: potentially offensive words. Proceed at your own risk. Also, apologies for the length.)I realize this risks opening up the "does Japanese actually have swear words" debate, touched on here, and a little here too.After exploring the issue in those other questions, I'm content that there are some words that are definitely always vulgar swear words in Japanese (no need to repeat them here), and some words that are merely verbal jabs.However, there is one word that is still hard to nail down: 野郎{やろう}. It seems to cover such a wide range that I just have a hard time accepting most translations.I was reminded of the topic when, walking through Ebisu today, I looked up and noticed this sign for a mahjong parlour:(It's a little blurry, so just to be clear, the place is called 麻雀{マージャン}野郎{やろう}.)Let's say this store expanded to become an international mahjong chain of stores, and they wanted an English version of their name. What would we translate it toAccording to Space ALC, 野郎{やろう} means bloke, dude, fellow, and son of a gun. Very inoffensive.But, in that same entry, it also means the mildly offensive beggar, bugger (some might think this is worse), and hoser.On top of that, it also means the definitely offensive mofo, asshole, and son of a bitch.And, even further, it also means the inexplicable cuss (isn't that a verb), gazebo (isn't that a kind of patio), gazabo (what), gink (huh), and hooer (a what-er).Putting aside the bizarre words, we have a range that goes from dude to asshole. That's a hell of a wide range.Clearly, the sign would lean toward the milder, so maybe we'd translate it as "Mahjong Dude". But if that's true, then I have a hard time believing it could mean the stronger terms. After all, this sign stands on it's own, so why not translate it as "Mahjong Asshole"I get the fact that words in languages can have a wide range. "Aloha", in Hawaiian, apparently means both hello and goodbye.But part of the reason I have a hard time accepting the vagueness of this particular potentially offensive word is that, as Japanese learners, we're beaten over the head with the notion that the Japanese hold politeness in high regard so that they are sensitive to the slightest mishaps. Not saying さん after someone's name in a certain situation, or perhaps addressing someone with あなた, would cause offense.And yet at the same time, we can have a word that goes from dude to asshole and everyone's cool with that"Aloha" might mean contrary things, but none of its meanings are potentially offensive, so I can see why it wasn't forced into one particular meaning. But I can't see how a word with high risk of insult survives in a culture that otherwise seems quite rigid about how to avoid offense.Something doesn't add up in this word, and I suspect it has to do with a great deal of license on the part of most translations. Real offensiveness comes from the words surrounding 野郎{やろう}, not 野郎{やろう} itself.So... after all that preamble:What would the most accurate translation of the sign beIf my idea that the words around 野郎{やろう} are what really manipulate it's offensiveness level, then let's zero in on what exactly the naked word means and what it, and it alone, conveys in offensiveness.Or show me where and how everything I'm saying is just totally wrong and I'm just being a 馬鹿{ばか}野郎{やろう}.
I wanted to talk about a board game recently, and realized that I am missing all related vocabulary. Before you shout foul and throw dictionaries at me, these expressions are very difficult to look up, because most of them use existing words in new contexts. And I cannot ask the native Japanese I know, because they don't know the english terminology either. I'll make a list, and possibly add more to it if some are suggested. I am basically looking for the vocabulary to be able to explain any board game to someone.GeneralTake a turn ("Your turn!", ...)Passing a turn.Token. (Many games have tokens, be it for money, health, victory points and so on)Piece, as in Chess.[Some statistic] meter / counter. (Threat meter)Pick a card/miniature/faction/... randomly.Words I have seen often, but which are made up to begin withVictory Point.CardsDraw a card.Discard a random card.Discard a card of your choice.A deck of cards.The correct expression for "hand".DiceThrow dice, or roll dice.Reroll dice.Count the sixes. (or any other)Non-6-sided dice, in english usually called d8, d12 or d20.
Yep, I'm reading a lot of Tintin in Japanese recently, and he keeps throwing me curve balls with the language. Here's another one.The situation is that the car he was in has been run off the road into a small lake. A few people have gathered around to see if he's okay, and he asks if there is anyone in the group who can drive him the rest of the way to Nyon (a small city in Switzerland).Here's how he asks:The part I'm wondering about is where he says 「ところでみなさんの中{なか}にニヨンにつれってくださるかたありません？」Unless I'm missing something, he is using ありません, the negative form of ある, to refer to people. I was taught that one should use いる for people, and that it would be rude to use ある, because of the obvious implication that you are referring to them as inanimate objects.Especially since he is asking for a considerable favour from strangers, shouldn't Tintin use いるWhy did the translator opt to use あるBonus question: Could Tintin have used おりません in this situation Keigo always trips me up, but I thought おる was a more polite way of saying いる... I'm not sure if おる is humble or not, and if it would imply he was being humble or if it would impose humbleness on the people he was talking to (and therefore not fit).
I was taught ages ago that the volitional form of a verb means "let's" do something. For example, if you take 行{い}く and change it to 行{い}こう, you get "let's go".However, I feel like I can use the same form to express "I want to". For example:行{い}こうかなと思{おも}っている ("[I'm] thinking maybe I'll go")Am I wrong that it can be used this wayIf it's true that it can mean that, what is the difference between the sentence I have above and this one:行{い}くかなと思{おも}っているMy understandng of the plain form is that it can be used to imply future tense, and if so, maybe it also implies intention. If so, then the two sentences mean the same thing, don't theyPerhaps I'm thinking too much in English, though, where "will go" can be both intention and future tenseSo, my questions in summary are:Does 行{い}こう mean "will go" as well as "let's go"Can 行{い}こう and 行{い}く both be used to mean future tense and/or intention
In this question, it seems to me it was clearly established that わ, at the end of a sentence, is decidedly feminine. There was talk of a Kansai-ben わ with slightly different implications, but still within a range of femininity.So, I'm reading Tintin in Japanese, as I do, and I come across the character Captain Haddock using わ:The situation is that he is on a plane that has dropped altitude suddenly, so his ears were plugged. They just popped, and he feels スッキリ("refreshed").For those who don't know Captain Haddock, he is a gruff old sailor, who is not at all given to feminine speech. Quite the opposite. This expression really stands out.Also, to the best of my ability to detect it, he does not use Kansai-ben, which I only mention because of the discussion of Kansai-ben in the other question.So why did the translator opt to have the Captain use わ to end the sentence here Is it an ironic use of feminine speech Does it have another use I'm not aware of
I don't understand the role of "な" when used before "のに" as in these two sentences (with given translations):朝目がさめて初めて、外が雪なのに気がついた。He noticed that there was snow outside only after he woke up in the morning.せっかくの日曜日なのに働いた。Although Sunday is precious (to me), I worked (all day long).I'm similarly confused by the なので pattern, but I assume the principle is the same there.My best guesses so far are that:There's some relation to な-adjectives, but I don't see how 雪 or 日曜日would be acting as adjectives here.The な has essentially the samerole as だ (i.e. a "copula"), but you can't use だ in the middle of asentence like that.
This one probably needs a Japanese and Mahjong expert to decipher:（３）全局を一ハン（飜）しばりとし、二ハン場とする。This is the third rule about the basic game setup of (my version of) the official Japanese Mahjong Tournament rules. A 局 kyoku is one round, a ハン／飜 han is a type of multiplier used in scoring. So far so good, but I have no idea what this rule is trying to convey. There's no further context in the immediately preceding or following rules. Can somebody tell me what this means
I've come across this sentence in my manga.そ　そうか　そういう疑いを持っているのかIt's actually fairly easy, but the particle at the end has confused me. I thought it was the two particles の and か, but then I saw this in a dictionary:のか - Particle - endorsing and questioning the preceding statement (sentence ending particle); lamenting reflections on the preceding statement (sentence ending particle)That seems to fit, because it's at the end of the sentence, and he's commenting on what another character said to themselves. But beyond that, I have little idea of what this means. Is it actually a question particle similar to か When would you use this instead

Didn't the author mean furigana instead Maybe I didn't grasp something here.Lastly, what are the most important (to know)/most frequent homographic Kanji out there
All of my Japanese teachers have told me that な-adjectives converted to に-ending words and い-adjectives converted to く-ending words, when followed by a verb, are 'adverbs'.  However, sentences sound ridiculous when translated in keeping with this principle:  静かにランチが食べたいです。  'I want to eat lunch quietly.' or  'I want to eat a quiet lunch.'静かにしなさい。  'Be quiet!' or  'Be quietly!'汚いことをいっぱい言ったくせになんなの？　臭くなりましたか？  'What's with you saying so many damn dirty things  Are you being stinky' or  'What's with you saying so many damn dirty things  Are you being stinkily' (Obviously, stinkily isn't a word... but...)...Is there any way I can accommodate my academic learning and my true-to-life experience simultaneously, or do I have to surrender one of them for the otherAlso, can you pay especially close attention to the first sentence  I'm a little sad that I haven't been able to find the words that mean 'a quiet lunch'.  Alongside the first sentence in this post, 静かな場所でランチが食べたいです is a considered alternative, but it means, 'eat lunch in a quiet place'.  This doesn't comprise the implied 'peace of mind' that 'a quiet lunch' retains in English.
I will first state the dictionary entry, and then other formations that also yield the dictionary entry.Consider the following :思える　- to seem/appear, potential form of 思う - can think合わせる　- to join together, potential form of 合わす - can join togethercausative form of 合う - to let suit/match/agree with解ける - to come untied / be solvedpotential form of 解く - can untie/solve空ける - to emptypotential form of 空く - can become emptyAs above, there are words that in their potential/causative form that already have a dictionary meaning that is different from their conjugated forms.(Question) Were they equal in meaning at some point in time Or are they completely different words and should be treated as such
Can you tell me the difference between 壱 and 一, 弐 and 二, 参 and 三Do these pairs have the same meaning If yes, why do we use different Kanji If no, what is the difference in their meaningsCan you give example usage in sentences for each of them
In one of my study flashcards, I have this sentence:疲{つか}れぎみだけど生{い}きてます。Which should translate to something like, "[He] appears worn out but [he's] still kicking."The main point is that in this instance, my understanding is that ぎみ means "appears to," or, "looks like."This card just came up in the rotation, and I remembered seeing this question, where it is explained that がる also means something similar.So similar, that I'm wondering what exactly is the difference between がる and ぎみObviously one difference is that がる can be modified ("conjugated") like a verb (maybe it is a verb of some kind) to become がっている, and ぎみ doesn't look like it can be modified in any way that I'm aware of. So there almost certainly a difference in grammatical usage.The definitions still seem to be pretty much the same though.Can someone explain if they have different implications in meaning, and in what situations one would apply and the other couldn't
I would like to know how we say taking class or course or lecture in japanese.I have heard about　「クラスを受ける」　and 「クラスを取る」. Are there significant difference And Is there any other verb we can use with
This question already has an answer here:                                            Does は mean 'at least' in this sentence                                (1 answer)                            Closed 4 years ago.Can は mean "at least" in some situationsFor example, 10回は＝"at least 10 times"How does this workThis is an example:美味しかったぁ。腹いっぱい。今日のところはジャスミン茶は諦めよう。何回もドリンクバー行くの恥ずかしいし。一人じゃなかったら余裕で10回は行ってやるんだからな！
While studying Japanese I've met some problems with distinguishing some vocabulary.For example we have:赤{あか} = Red (color)赤{あか}い = Red (adjective) But what about 赤色{あかいろ} Is there a difference between that and 赤{あか} Is the former just there in order to study the Kanji, or are there differences in usage (and maybe "acception") between the twoI suspect it's the second, but it would be nice to have a good explanation about it.
My friend and I were having a debate. Basically, the line　「あんたは一人でこの家から学校に通っている。」 in an anime was translated as "And you live here alone, attending school."A direct literal translation of the Japanese seems to give a different English sentence. However, my question is: XからYに通っている the normal way of saying "(You) attend Y" He seems thinks that saying "You go back and forth from home to school" is a weird, if not too wordy, way to say "attending school". (Added after Chris' answer:)I'm providing the whole response from the character in the anime (for context).ゆうむら家の３人は、半年前にこの家を購入し、転居してきた。間もなくあんたの両親はアメリカに赴任し、あんたは一人でこの家から学校に通っている。The subtitled translation:The Yuumura family of three bought this house half a year ago and moved in. Soon after, your parents went to America to their new job posts. And you live here alone, attending school.
In this sentence:ゆうむら家の３人は、半年前にこの家を購入し、転居してきた。この家を is pronounced as "kono yo" as opposed to "kono ie o". And this phraseあんたは一人でこの家から学校に通っている。この家 is pronounced as "kono ye" as opposed to "kono ie".So my question is, is this normal pronunciation for 家 when Japanese people talk normally/colloquially Note: sentence from Noir the anime, Episode 1.
What are the different ways to make a sentence that ends in なかった polite
I can say 売り場は九時で終わります、 and 三時で帰ります、 which I've learned mean something like, "They'll be trying to close from," and, "I'll be trying to leave from."  I've also learned that ２月２５日で帰ります is not correct.  What are the rules surrounding the use of で in the place of に・から  Is there a more approximate meaning

I recently came across the term 変{へん}てこ, which, if I understand it, means "strange", but is softer than saying 変{へん}な.Is it similar to 変{へん}なちょこ I think this also means strange, but also in a softer, possibly cute way.In short, can someone clarify the different nuances of 変{へん}てこ, 変{へん}な, and 変{へん}なちょこAlso, are there other examples of ～てこ, or is it only used with 変{へん}
Ok. The whole sentence is:Person A bandages Person B's arm.Person B says: ありがとう。ずいぶん慣れた処置ね？看護婦でもやってたの？I get what the sentences are saying.But! For the life of me I can't parse ずいぶん慣れた処置ね？ into that makes any sense to me. All I can come up with is: "You do very accustomed treatments." Which I know barely makes any sense (grammatical or otherwise).Can someone please break this down for me
”I did some difficult studying last night."Could I say, "昨夜、難しい勉強しました。”Basically, my question is: can an adjective, relative clause, or adjectival phrase modify a noun that has する attached, for example 勉強をする or 勉強する　And does it make that word or phrase actually adverbial when applied like that
Expanding on my previous question,What if the range is not numerical I encountered these on a book for learning Japanese.The 初～中級編 book for beginner to intermediate level and 中～上級編 for intermediate to advanced level.(Question) If I were to read "~" out loud, what would it be Can I similarly use から and 乃至In English I can use "From One to ten" and "From beginner to advanced", is it reasonable for me to map this to Japanese i.e. the use of から and まで
Japanese for Busy People 1 (lesson 11) mentions when talking about [キス]{kisu} (whiting) at a [てんぷらや]{tempura-ya}:NOTE: Names of fish, fruits and vegetables etc. are sometimes written in katakana.Does using katakana only apply when talking about the animal, as opposed to talking about the food (For an English equivalent, people refer to the animal as "shark" but sometimes refer to the food as "flake")Assume that it's not gairaigo and therefore would be in katakana anyway.
人の目なんて。気にしてられないと思えるようになる。You can't concern yourself with what other people think.I saw this on a TV show where the hosts were talking about coming out in public if you are gay. They had both come out of the closet and were saying what a positive thing this is to do.I'm pretty sure I translated it accurately. However, I have some questions on the intricacies of the grammar.So気にしてられないwould mean: "can't concern" "can't be concerned", andと思えるようになる。means: "come to think that/ come to terms with"so put together it literally means:be able to come to the point where you aren't concerned with what other people think.Is this rightTo further clarify, here is a link to the original clip.The part I quoted is from 3:00-3:20The speaker actually says something extra between と and 思える but I can't make it out. If anyone would care to tell me, I'd appreciate it.http://www.youtube.com/watchv=sYNU1LEXWhM&amp;feature=related
I'm looking for a website with free audio recordings of Japanese children books. I found one a long time ago but alas I lost my bookmark to that site. I'm planning to go through those books since it'll be easier to follow the japanese they speak as opposed to listening to japanese talk shows and such for adults. Is this a good way to work on my listeningAnyone have a recommendation
In English and most languages I understand, the natural way to tell your phone to call someone (when using Bluetooth for example) is:Call .I was told that in Japanese, it is more natural to say the contact name first.-- Is there a way to mimic in Japanese a similar format, in which the command prefixes the contact name I understand it might be less natural, but would it be natural enough -- Is there already a "standard" that people expect based on how different devices already work in Japan Are people expecting to interact with "machines" in different language than with other humans
I found the sentence:女性の身体は本来美しいもの。'The female body is a fundamentally beautiful thing.'in the following passage:毎食後2錠から3錠、油っこい食事のあとは少し多めに飲むだけと、とっても簡単にダイエットできてしまいます。'An effective diet can be achieved simply achieved by taking from two to three pills after each meal, the number increasing with the oil content the cuisine.'女性の身体は本来美しいもの。'The female body is a fundamentally beautiful entity.'私のお気に入りの『ハーモニー7』は、身体の機能を整えながら自然にバランスの取れたプロポーションに戻してくれる、ダイエットの強－－い味方です。'Harmony 7 appeals to me because of its ability to arrange the body's functions whilereturning to a natural balance of proportions, making it an ideal diet support.'Is the quoted sentence grammatical Is the verb hidden I apologize in advance for my ignorance as this question has probably arisen before and been answered.
What's the real, definite difference between [寝]{ね}る and [眠]{ねむ}る  I know they both mean "sleep", but also that each carries some additional (sometimes, figurative) meanings.Where do the meanings overlap In what scenarios are they interchangeable
Asking this other question has reminded me of another confusion I often have, one of my long standing bad habits that you'd think I'd have sorted after all this time in Japan.I'm never quite sure how to end a list of two or more things. So, I want to say "I like apples and oranges."Saying it this way seems weird, because of having と and が together. It just feels weird in my mouth.りんごとオレンジとが好{す}きだ。This next option also feels weird, though, because it's like saying, "apples and oranges and like".りんごとオレンジと好{す}きだ。Which is right Or are both wrongDoes it make a difference if there's more than two itemsりんごとオレンジとパパイヤと(が)好{す}きだ。
Recenly, with Facebook's new "feed" feature, whatever the heck that is, I've been seeing this notification coming up a lot:[Friend One]さんと[Friend Two]さんがフィード購読{こうどく}を許可{きょか}しています。I have to admit, even though it's such a simple sentence, it actually confuses me a little. Does it mean Friend One and Friend Two have given permission to have their feeds be subscribed to by anyone Or does it mean that they have given each other permission to see each other's feed Something elseBasically, I'm not sure if the と means "and", as in "friend and friend have done X", or if the と means "with", as in "friend has done X with friend."Part of the confusion is that I don't know what the "feed" feature does, but I think part of the learning here is that I shouldn't be reliant on that information to work out what the Japanese means. I don't think I'd necessarily need that information to parse a similar sentence in English.(PS: Yes, I could switch my Facebook interface to English and just see what the translation is, but I think parsing the Japanese on its own terms has more learning potential.)
What would be the interpretation of verbs that have two levels of 'teiru' and 'rare' in them I figure that the 'teiru' will be one for stative/perfective and the other for progressive, and the 'rare' will be one for passive/honorific and one for possibility/ability. Here are a few from Google search:-神社には何がまつられてられているのだろうか？-富士の名水で育ってられてられてます-脇道も階段として整えてられてられているのだが　(3 'te'!)-調べてられてられないという事情も理解してくださいThese aren't that common, probably because they're hard to say and a little complicated to parse (think "the fish will have been being eaten"). I'm guessing the interpretations would be something like "have been able to be being done something to".Of course, there's the possibility that this is something that people say because they think it's funny, or some sort of typo :) If both interpretations of both words are actually in the verb, could someone with a native intuition tell me which one means whichEdit:Lots more googling. I searched for two patterns: "られてられて" and "てられてられ". The first one got much more hits than the second one, and with more formal and professional language (though there were exceptions).Also, I think, a cool discovery: emphasis via repetition of the passive auxiliary. Tell me if it's wrong. Examples:-最近、復職を求められてられてばかりで落ち込み気味。-また、マスコミに煽られてられて投資信託を購入しましたが-見せられてられて火病を起こしているようにしか見えないぞｗｗ
I saw this sentence and its translation in a textbook彼女は太った猫が好きじゃない。  She doesn't like fat catsI was under the impression that 「太ってる猫」 means something like “cat that is in the state of becoming fat”, which basically means “fat”, so I was wondering:What's the difference between 「太ってる猫」 and 「太った猫」If a cat has been fat since birth, is it true that in this situation then, we can only use 「太っている猫」 and not 「太った猫」 since the cat was already fat right from the start and did not “get fat”
その翼はとても滑らかに動くため、まるでコンピュータ・グラフィックスを見ているようだった。Its wings were moving so smoothly that it almost looked like CGI.or would a more accurate translation be:Its wings were moving so smoothly that it felt like I was looking at a CGI simulation.I have a few questions about this sentence.  Is 見ているようだった better translated as "it almost looked like" or "felt like I was looking at"Is this 見ている the act of looking, or is it "looking like"Thirdly is the まるで somewhat superfluous (I don't say this to be critical of the Japanese language I am just interested in the subtleties) If it is meaning "just like" in this sentence, is that role not also being played by the  "ようだった" Or is that just an established usage -- まるで ending with "ようだった"-- that flows naturally without any repetitive quality ( it sounds fine to my ear I was just interested in any clarifications )Lastly, and this question is a bit superfluous, is CGI commonly used in Japanese or is コンピュータ・グラフィックス usually used instead コンピュータ・グラフィックス sounds a little dated to me, though I found this sentence on Lang8 yesterday. I apologize for using superfluous twice.
I noticed that in this book on bioinformatics with Ruby (the programming language!) (Rubyではじめるバイオインフォマティクス―生物系のためのプログラミング入門), the authors sometimes used romanized Japanese in code examples. For example it sometimes uses hairetsu_1 for the variable name of an array (that'd translate as array_1).When not programming in English, do Japanese programmers use a consistent romanization scheme, and if so, which one
酔{よ}う and 酔{よ}っ払{ぱら}う both seem to mean "to get drunk" but how are they different from each other Does it depend on how drunk you are, and assuming 酔っ払う is worse than 酔う, exactly how drunk would you need to be to cross from 酔う to 酔っ払う Does the 払う part has any meaning or purpose
What is the difference between これから and いまから？ Both seem to have the meaning of 'from now on'.これから、食べます。  いまから、食べます。Do the sentences above carry the same meaning
目立つ事を恐れ、一緒でなければいけないという日本人が確実に減ってきているのです。The strong feelings that Japanese have of being afraid of standing out and everybody having to do things together are starting to become less prominent.To better understand this sentence, I tried to translate it myself more literally, and came up with this:The "being afraid of standing out, always having to do things together " kind of Japanese person is definitely starting to decrease.I am wondering if my interpretation of 確実 is correct. I usually know it as "certainly" and I guess in the original translation it kind of got spread towards "prominent". I'm also wondering if the 減ってきているのです could have been written as 減ってきています。Does the のです add meaning to the sentenceI'm not sure if these kind of questions are discouraged on this site, so please tell me if I'm out of line.
I noticed that ってなわけで is commonly used as a substitute for というわけで in colloquial speeches, but what exactly is the purpose of the な-particle in that phrase Does it make the context that the phrase refers to adjective-ish, like suggested in this answerOr is it actually the な-particle that is similar in usage to the one in それなのに How does the construction work though
Technically the word 微妙 meansas per WWWJDIC:(adj-na,n) (1) delicate; subtle; sensitive; (2) difficult; delicate (situation); complicated; (3) doubtful; questionable; dicey;However, last time I stayed in Tokyo ( about a year ago) most of my Japanese friends (about 25-30 years old) were using 微妙 to mean "kinda sucky" or "boring in an annoying way".I believe I remember a sentence like this:海はどうだった？まあちょっと微妙。How was the beach Eh... it kinda sucked.I also heard it used as an adverb with this meaning but I can't remember an example. When I asked my friends about it, they said they don't really use that word for positive things, though none of the numerous examples I saw on ALC had this slangy type of meaning. I guess the meaning of subtle mixed with dicey and then became "so either-or that it just sucks" If anyone can explain the subtleties of this slang usage, I've been wondering for a while.
一目ぼれから長持ちする関係は望めません。Falling in love at first sight won't bring you a lasting relationship.I found this sentence and translation without any other context, andhave a few questions about the expressions used here.First off, after studying the sentence, I came up with two alternate translations:You can't hope for a long-lasting relationship from falling in love at first sight.You cant expect a long-lasting relationship from falling in love at first sight.Which translation of 望めません do you think is more accurate (if accurate at all)Secondly, if 長持ちする is a verb meaning "to be long-lasting" or "to be durable", is 長持 ever used by itself, perhaps as a noun
There is an Indonesian song with titled "Aishiteru" which is fully in Indonesian language except for one line in Japanese (and a few "a a a aishiteru" lines).YouTube link The one line in Japanese starts at 2:38, which I transcribed below but I have difficulty in deciding the part with question marks:君が遠くにいても  [  ] がつながるから  信じてるよ  信じてるよAt first I thought it was 昨日思い but dismissed it because it's grammatically wrong unless there is a の particle there. So now I'm guessing that it's "ki no omoi", 気の思い, but I have never seen that phrase before and I couldn't find it in dictionaries. What does the phrase mean Could it be 気の重い instead (also not found in dictionaries)Here is the English translation of the stanza that follows after that one line, in case it would help set up the context:Even though our bodies are far apart,  Our hearts are always near,  When you miss me just close your eyes,  And think of me.Any idea anyone
Taking yadokari's sentence:彼女は表情が生き生きとしておりとてもかわいい。The part that I need help understanding is the relation of 生き生きとして with　表情　and　居る.Looking up the dictionary entry for 生き生き, it is "an adverb taking the と particle"(Question 1) Does the adverb modify して Or is 生き生きとして treated as an adverb as a wholeEDIT: What is the difference between 1. 生き生きとする and 2. 生き生きとして居る (Question 2) Is 2. the ~ている construction of 1. And what is its significance when used with an adverb English parsing would be greatly appreciated.
In a bizarre and transparently ineffective attempt to try and change the culture of Shibuya's central shopping district, the shopowners promotion association (商店街{しょうてんがい}振興{しんこう}組合{くみあい}) has changed the name of the main shopping road in front of the station from センター街{がい}(centre street) to バスケットボールストリート(basketball street).Or, apparently, if you're as "hip" as the geriatric bureaucrats who came up with this, you would call it バスケ通{どお}り.Anyway, in the article where I read about this, a pro basketball player attending the naming ceremony was quoted as follows:千葉{ちば}ジェッツの石田{いしだ}剛規{たけのり}選手{せんしゅ}（２９）は「この有名{ゆうめい}な通{どお}りにふさわしいプレーをしていかなければ」と語{かた}った。I'm not sure on the reading of the guy's name. Anyway, my rough translation is:"Ishida Takenori (29), of the Chiba Jets, said, "We have to play appropriately  (in/for) this famous street."I'm confused about the use of に, because it seems that he is saying they, the basketball league, need to play appropriately in the street. Which would be kind of a weird thing to do. Despite the new name, I don't think anyone intends to actually play there.It makes more sense to me, given the overall context, that he would be saying something more about how the league needs to set a good example for the street by playing appropriately in general, at their games. I'm not familiar with に being used to mean "for" in this way, though.So it seems from my (poor) understanding of grammar that his statement should mean play in the street, but from my understanding of the situation it should mean play for the street.Is either guess correct Am I wrong either way What exactly is he saying
彼女は表情が生き生きとしておりとてもかわいい。was translated awkwardly on ALC asShe is very pretty for the liveliness of her expression.Which おり is this I think I know it from the polite しております　but is it here wielding more expressive meaning
I've seen the honorific "o"/"go" (is it called bikago) being used as politness or reverence: o-cha for non-western tea, o-namae when talking about someone else's name, o-genki instead of just genki, and o-tera for Buddhist temple. However, I've recently come across (in "Welcome to Japanese") o-tearai for bathroom, which is presumably a modification of tearai.Google-sensei directed me to http://www.learnjapanese.com/japanese-o-factor/ and http://www.peterpayne.net/2008/05/useful-japanese-honorific-o.html , which talk about it being used for dirty things, such as a potty, diapers and female anatomy.Is it sometimes used to soften things that are somehow "dirty", or is it being used ironically
Taking 2 sentences from WWWJDIC as examples:見てごらん。２人の男の子がけんかしている。議論は最後に喧嘩になった。I was wondering is it true that the 「喧嘩」 in the sentences above may be interpreted both ways (i.e. it may be a physical fight, but it could as well have been a quarrel (verbal fight) instead)
あなたの私生活についてとやかく言うつもりはありません。I don't give a damn about your personal life.I have also seen についてとやかく言う translated as "quibble over".Could another translation of this sentence be:あなたの私生活についてとやかく言うつもりはありません。I really don't want to bicker about your private life.Is についてとやかく言う normally understood as metaphorical rather than literally "bicker" or "quibble over" There was no other context for this quote, so I am also wondering if とやかく is that harsh of an interjection.
Can it cover an entire month Two
ほんの時々私の中で顔を出し、しばらくすると消えてしまうもの。My attempt at translation: "Every once in a while my inner feelings show themselves, only to disappear again."The above was taken from the following dialogue:けれども時々不満を感じることもある。  それは、いつも感じているわけではない。  ほんの時々私の中で顔を出し、しばらくすると消えてしまうもの。  けれどこれから長い人生共に歩んでいくためにあなたにも考えてほしい。Translation provided by the source: "It is something that shows its face occasionally, and after a while it disappears again."So 私の中で is a set phrase, followed by 顔を出し, another set phrase. Could one replace the で with では instead, without changing the meaning, or are there any other connecting words/particles one could use I am confused (unfamiliar) as to how the two set phrases back to back flow naturally, but I suppose this is a common usage
日本のテレビを見ると、サブタイトルがいつも出てきます。でもサブタイトルじゃなくて。。。何と言いますか？what does one call Japanese "subtitles" that constantly appear in Japanese television and to a  lesser extent movies I'm referring to a sentence that someone on TV says, which is then immediately written onscreen to emphasize the expression (often for humor).OK so I asked my friend, and she said it's calledテロップis this rightOn a cultural level, any guesses as to why this phenomena is so frequent in Japanese media, yet the equivalent is pretty rare in Western countries
Is this the correct way to ask which of two options is trueあの CD は　トルコご　の　ですか　えいご　の　ですか？("Is that CD in Turkish or English")
This book (Chap. 29) says that for some verbs which can be unilateral or bilateral (like 相談する, 話す, 合う),The particle と implies that the verb is shared 50/50 between the two participants (bilateral), whereas the particle に implies that the main (or only) person doing the action is the subject (unilateral):For example:ジョンがトムに話した。 (John talked to Tom)ジョンがトムと話した。 (John talked with Tom)ジョンがトムに相談した。 (John consulted Tom)ジョンがトムと相談した。 (John consulted with Tom)I was wondering since ジョンがトムと話した。 already implies that it is a bilateral action, what is the difference in nuance between ジョンがトムと話した。 and ジョンがトムと話し合った。
This is a an example sentence from a JLPT textbook to explain the use of たらしめる:想像力{そうぞうりょく}こそ作品{さくひん}を芸術{げいじゅつ}たらしめる要素{ようそ}である。I understand the meaning, which is something like, "The key element in making a work of art out of ability is imagination."I have this sentence in my flashcards, and even though I've looked at it dozens of times, it still seems awkward to me.To make a long story short, it feels like it should be something like:想像力{そうぞうりょく}こそ作品{さくひん}を芸術{げいじゅつ}たらしめるのは要素{ようそ}である。Is my のは version any more or less grammatical Is it merely wrong Does it change the meaningIf the original sentence is fine, can someone break down for me how the first part of the sentence (up to the end of たらしめる) connects and relates to the end part (要素{ようそ}である)
This is another question that's come from a 昔話。We have the following section:大きい箱と小さい箱がありますが、どちらがいいですか。  どちらも結構じゃが、どうしてもと言うのなら、小さいほうでよかろう。I'm having trouble with the second sentence. My translation is:どちらも結構じゃが - Either one is fine. - Here, I think じゃ is a contraction of では and has the same effect as using です.どうしてもと言うのなら - If you say I must - の seems like the explanation modality to me.小さいほうでよかろう - The little one would be better. - I'm guessing that ほうで is a less emphatic version of ほうが. Just going on context for よかろう meaning good.What I'm really interested in is where よかろう came from. At first glance, it seemed like some crazy old volitional form (行こう!）, but It seems kind of ridiculous for there to be a volitional form of an adjective. It really seems like it could be the adjectival form of だろう. (I read something that sounded similar to this that was the adjectival form of だろう, but cannot find the link again.)What does  よかろう mean Is it equivalent to いいだろう Is this just one of those old fashioned feeling Japanese grammatical forms Is there a case where I could actually put this to use (other than reading 昔話)
At my schools 日本語クラブ, we studied a 昔話 (舌切り雀）, which like most of the others I've read, had some nonstandard grammatical constructions. I've heard that many of these constructions are archaic forms that are generally no longer used (or used much less often). It also seems that some of the grammar is very similar to many dialects of Japanese other than Tokyo dialect. For example: 申し訳ないことをしてしもうた。 It seems like しもうた is equivalent to しまった. As far as I know, this isn't standard Japanese, but is currently used in kansai and chuugoku dialects. Other than the characters' dialog, this story seems to be written in standard Japanese. My conjecture is that rather than being reflective of the Japanese language of the past, しもうた may be taken from another dialect to lend itself to the rural, countryside feel. Alternatively, this grammar could be from older Japanese, that has managed to persist in other dialects.Was しもうた ever a part of the standard japanese dialectDo 昔話 borrow from the other current dialects to create their atmosphere or do they generally only use older Japanese forms
I've found learning to speak Japanese in a classroom, rather than being self-taught, is useful because you get feedback on whether what you're saying sounds correct. Is the same true about learning to read and write the kana Are there risks in merely self-learning, or is it ok to do so If the former, is it ok to do it in your own time and briefly show your "homework" to your teacherI've got some books for learning the kana including "Kana can be easy", which includes the correct stroke order and warning about which kana are similar to which other kana. And the ubiquitous pictures used as mnemonics!
人生に生き甲斐を求めてギターを習い始めた。I started learning guitar to give myself something to do with my life.Is this translation a little too looseCan　求める mean giveOr would another way of translating this sentence would be:I wanted more out of my life, so I began to learn the guitar.orI wanted something to do with my life, so I began to learn the guitar.
What is the difference in nuance between きのう、何をしていた。 vs きのう、何をした。 To be fair, I can't really tell the difference between these two english sentences:What were you doing yesterday What did you do yesterday Is it true that like their english counterparts, きのう、何をしていた。 and きのう、何をした。 has no difference,Or is it true that there is some kind of hidden difference somewhere

Consider the following:そいつはひどく鼻持ちならないやつで、私をすっかりうんざりさせる。(That guy is so obnoxious that he really turns me off.)あなたをうんざりさせるものは何ですか？(What turns you off)痛み以上に私をうんざりさせるものはない。(Nothing turns me off more than pain.)自分の悩み事で人をうんざりさせてはいけないよ。(Don't bore people with your problems.)非常にうんざりさせる人　(thundering bore)うんざりさせられる状況　(irksome situation)うんざりさせられる試験　(boring exam)あの子にはうんざりする。(The kid is a pain in the neck)This may be due to a lack of adequate understanding of Japanese grammar, but I'm a bit confused as to how a number of different formations are used with this word to mean the same thing.うんざりさせられる状況a situation that makes me bored/turned offあの状況にはうんざりさせられる　　（is this correct)That situation turned me off/irked me.Could I also sayあの状況にはうんざりするorあの状況にはうんざりさせるI apologize if this question is too broad.
The linguistics text I’m reading has a sentence with this fragment: 「動詞の表す動作・作用が[…]」。 Consulting dictionaries just made me more confused; what’s the contrast between the two in this context “Action” vs. “effect”
I was wondering what the differences are between these three: ～がたい、〜にくい、〜づらいThey all seem to be some sort of variant of "Hard to do ~". But it seems they are used with different verbs and/or imply slightly different things. However, I'm not sure on what these are.Questions:1) When should you use one of these over the others. For example, when should you use ~がたい over ～にくい and ～づらい2) What is the difference (and are all 3 acceptable) between:わかりがたい わかりにくいわかりづらい
I have a couple of questions. Can verb-suru verbs be classified as jidoushi/tadoushiAnd could you take a look at this legend to help clear up my confusionHigher-res: http://i.stack.imgur.com/PkLYB.jpgI'm having trouble understanding the significance of the ガ/ヲ and (ヲ)スル that gets wrapped around the vocabulary items in this vocab book.It mentions that ガ/ヲ indicate 自動詞/他動詞, but I don't know if that applies to the bold part of the vocabulary item (the 見出し語) — it's rare but there are entries that have an ＜他＞ or  ＜自＞ mark, along with accompanying example sentences.Also confusing is that an example sentence for 超過 uses を (albeit with a marker over the を) even though ガ is prefixed to the vocab item.So, what's the significance of them They come in a variety of combinations:ヲ設定（ヲ）スルガ／ヲ中断スルガ作業（ヲ）スルI couldn't find an example when the ＜他＞  mark is used with verb-suru words, but here are some more examples:higher-res: http://i.stack.imgur.com/CUdMW.jpghigher-res: http://i.stack.imgur.com/Knl7b.jpghigher-res: http://i.stack.imgur.com/194Zk.jpg
Sometimes, a single foreign word or etymologically related words from different dialects/related languages is/are incorporated into Japanese with different transcriptions/pronouncations and often different meanings. The most obvious and systematic ones are the different on-yomi's assigned to a single kanji, which came from different ancient dialects of Chinese.明　(みん, めい, みょう)Besides kanji, there are some with gairaigo:ガラス &lt; glas (Dutch) 'glass, glass window'グラス &lt; glass (English) 'glass cup'コップ &lt; kop (Dutch) 'cup'カップ &lt; cup (English) 'trophy cup'Are there any other examples of gairaigo groups like thisI would like to exclude those that are due to 平板化 (deaccentation) such as the following:クラブ (KUrabu) &lt; club (English) 'club activities before/after school'クラブ (kuRABU) &lt; id.

I want to know the difference between 〜がる and 〜がっている, and in what situations I can use them.My friend said 〜がる is used for a regular activity that someone does every day or every week, and the person also wants to do that activity.〜がっている is used for activities that someone really wants to do but hardly has time to do.Is this right
Hi all I was wondering what is the difference between these two sentences:「決して悪気があっての回答ではないです。」「決して悪気がある回答ではないです。」I can't really make out the gist of the meaning of 「あっての」.WWWJDIC's explanation of 「あっての」 is "which can exist solely due to the presence of" (rather confusing..) and the example sentences do not really give much clue to the meaning/usage of the word.
For the longest time, I thought that a verb ending in て+いる meant that one was currently doing an action, similar to how we use ~ing in English to mean a contuinuing state. So 食{た}べている means "eating".However, I've run into confusion over sentences like 日本{にほん}に来ている. I thought it meant, "coming to Japan" but apparently it actually means "came to Japan and still here".After some looking into the issue, it seems that there is a thing in Japanese called a "punctual verb". These are actions that can not be extended or divided, so they're either done or not done. 来る it would seem, is one of these verbs, because you have either come or not. At least, as far as Japanese is concerned.However, the matter is not entirely resolved for me. Consider this screenshot from a weather report:Shouldn't 台風{たいふう}が日本{にほん}に来{き}ている mean "the typhoons have come to Japan and are already here" However, according to the dates included in the image, it is clearly depicting that the typhoons are on their way, in the process of coming.What is the dividing line between a punctual action and a continuing action, and how does one know which verbs are which

一生懸命な彼に申し訳ない気がしました。そこで、私は一度彼と会って面と向かって断ろうと思ったのです。  'I felt I had to do something so I decided to meet him face to face and tell him I wasn't interested.'一生懸命を副詞として使ったら 'eagerly, with utmost effort, very hard' という意味になると思います。でも形容詞として使ったらどんなニュアンスになりますか？この例で否定的なニュアンスがあるのか誰か説明してくれませんか？If 一生懸命 is used as a な-adjective to describe someone, is it usually negativeIn this example, the suitor was overly persistent, so the girl wanted to actively reject him.Please pardon any mistakes made in my faulty Japanese.
Which しんこう is the one Yotsuba-chan meant when she said 「しゅっぱつしんこ〜」 in the manga excerpt below WWWJDIC lists so many two-kanji words that read as しんこう, and even after eliminating totally irrelevant ones there are still a few plausible choices:新興 【しんこう】 (n,adj-no) rising; developing; emergent;  進行 【しんこう】 (n,vs) advance; progress;  進攻 【しんこう】 (n,vs) attack; drive; advance; invasion;  進航 【しんこう】 (n,vs) sailing on(From manga 「よつばと！」, 4th volume, page 30)
I'd like to get an idea of when it is appropriate to use different expressions for expressing disjunction (of the inclusive AND exclusive variety).「AとBとCの中で...」、「どちら」、and 「か」 come to mind, but I think they have situational usage (that I'm not entirely aware of). 「か」 seems somewhat awkward, 「どちら」 is limited to a decision between two things, and so forth. How would an inclusive or be expressed ('A or B' as opposed to 'either A or B')
I want to know the different between these two words. The meaning is the same which is social science. So, what is the differenceEdit: Sorry for confusing question. I mean the different usage.

When we say "birds singing", there is a positive connotation.When we say "birds crowing", there is a negative connotation."The birds are making some sound" seems to be objective, and thus neutral.I was wondering is it true that 鳴く is absolutely neutralIn other words, would the sentence 「小鳥が鳴いてる。」 have a positive connotation, negative connotation, or is it an absolutely neutral sentence
Knowing that 行く is punctual, stative, and a motion verb, I also know that, 日本に行っている means "I/he/she have gone to Japan (and am still there)" rather than "I am currently going to Japan."I also feel that 行っている can be used in the sense of habitual action, so that 大学に行っている can mean either "I'm at the college" or "I go to college" depending on the context.That being said, can I also use 行っている in the sense of a habitual action in conjunction with 間（に)大学に行っている間、もっと勉強すればよかった。- I wish I had studied more when I was going to college.大学に行っている間に高校の彼女と別れました。- While I was in college, I broke up with my girlfriend from high school.大学に行っている間、雨が降りました。- It was raining while I was at school.大学に行っている間に宿題をしました。- I did my homework while I was at school.
I think it's known that some intransitive verbs can take を particle and be used as transitive verbs such as for example 「私のことを分かってくれない」. While using 分かる transitively would require specific scenarios or patterns, from the point of view of an English speaker it just naturally makes sense, for the reason that "understand" is a transitive English verb.On the other hand, there are verbs that are naturally intransitive in both Japanese and English, that simply do not make sense to assign any noun objects, like 死ぬ and "to die". There is no way to imagine "Subject dies object", both in English and Japanese, unless if we modify it to "Subject allows/makes object to die" but that would change the main verb in question, again, both in English and Japanese.At first I thought 行く and 来る are parts of those naturally intransitive verbs, since there is no way for "Subject goes object" or "Subject comes object". And then I found a proverb 「天馬空を行く」, which made me look up "を行く" on Google. The result 8.75 millions results. "を来る" has 243K results which are a lot less but still a significant figure that shows that out there, 行く and 来る are used with を. However, my thought still remains, that there is no way for "subject goes object". Looking at sample usages, there seems to be a pattern of the nouns that are modified by "を行く" are roads, path etc, but imagining it in English as "to apply the act of going onto the road as the object" doesn't work to me. "を来る" does not even have any pattern that can be seen among the sample noun objects.Examples from Google results:お気楽サラリーマンジャングルを行く！歴史街道を行く一歩先を行くPythonプログラマが読むべきOSS私は私の道を行く晴れの日を来る遠い道を来るまでにSo, how do we make sense of 「を行く」 and 「を来る」
No, this is not about any Buddhist chant or mantra that can be used to call forth Japanese gods or heavenly spirits, but rather about any specialized words or interjections that attract attention of the God/spirits that we want to communicate with. Similar to the following equivalent interjections in some languages I know:English: 'O'e.g: O The Great GodArabic: 'يا' (pronunciation: Ya)e.g: ياربيMalay/Indonesian: 'Wahai'e.g: Wahai TuhankuDoes Japanese have such words/interjections Even though 神様へ might be serving the purpose, へ lacks the glorification that 'O' has. Note that 'O', 'يا' and 'Wahai' are not restricted to God/spirits/heavenly beings only since they can also be used towards people, for example in a sermon, so the Japanese equivalent(s) must also have to have similar scope in order to qualify.
I know that when I read sites like Wikipedia and there are foreign words they will often give the name with the original alphabet and spelling as well as a phonetic and a literal translation.  So for instance the entry for Tokyo has (東京 Tōkyō, "Eastern Capital") next to the first use of Tokyo.I had this thought because I was debating on how to translate the name of a place near where I live.  It's called Little Italy (think China town but Italian).  I was going to translate it phonetically as リトルイタリア but I think that loses some of the meaning so I was going to add 小さいイタリア with the specification that it was a literal translation.So my question is how do I indicate that something is a literal translation not a phonetic translation

This is from the comments on this youtube page where an infant is cuddling with a bemused cat.The commentator is writing on how cute the scene is. I am having trouble figuring out some of the subjects (which can be hard for students of japanese). If anyone would care to point out the subjects or correct my attempt at a very loose translation, it would be greatly appreciated. I'm having the most trouble in figuring out the first line. (The numbers only indicate the lines):自分だったら、これを大きくなってから見たら感動するだろうな。なんの気なしに一緒に暮らしている猫が 昔から、こんなに愛情深く寄り添ってくれていたなんて。「猫さん」「猫センパイ」と呼びたくなるレベル。To see these two growing up together would be so moving. (for me the speaker)Look at this laid back cat just living together like its nothing,snuggling up with so much love, must have been doing that for a long time. (for it to have been so comfortable)At this level I'd like to call him Mr. Cat, or even Prof. Cat. (superior cat)So in line 1, I'm having trouble understanding who this これを大きくなってから applies to. I'm guessing it's the kid and cat growing up together, not the writer growing up.Also in line 4, perhaps the writer is saying this:"Mr. Cat, at this level I'd like to call you Prof. Cat ((superior cat))"I know senpai doesn't relate to professor, but I just chose something someone might say in English. Also, does と呼びたくなる mean the speaker (him/herself) wants to call the cat senpai, or does the speaker want the cat to be called senpai by all in general (First person versus third person plural.)
In another forum, someone said the difference between誰が盗んだのか、誰か知りませんか。 and誰が盗んだか、誰か知りませんか。is that the former has more emphasis on the verb 盗む. Another person said that that's not the case.

I've long known 冷やす as the transitive counterpart of 冷える. But thanks to one question here, I've realized that there is another version with an extra syllable in it: 冷やかす. Although 冷やかす seems to have secondary meaning of making fun of someone, the first meaning "to refrigerate" seems to overlap with 冷やす. Is there any difference between themBeing curious, I looked up in the dictionary for other verbs that have "Xsu" and "Xkasu" variants and found another pair: 散らかす and 散らす. Same question, how are they differentLastly, are there any other verb pairs that are different in look from each other by one additional syllable while still maintaining transitivity, and would there be any pattern on how the verbs in each pair different from each other
I was taught in college that the 〜ない verb conjugation behaves like an i-adjective, thus it has 〜く form, it takes 〜ければ for "if" scenario, it modifies the noun that follows it etc. Also, I know that the 〜くて form of i-adjective has overlapping roles with 〜て form of verb, such that it can be used to combine the i-adjective or verb with the next predicate, e.g. 滑りやすくて転んだ and 転んで泣いた. However, while 〜て form of verb can be used before auxiliary ください, for verbs that have been conjugated with 〜ない, instead of using the 〜なくて form with ください, we have to use 〜ないで form instead. I just learned from sawa's answer for my previous question that i-adjective (even with 〜くて form) cannot be followed immediately by ください for the reason that the main verb is missing, but 〜なくて conjugation is attached to a verb so the issue of missing main verb should not be there anymore. Yet, why is it still not 〜なくてください, but is 〜ないでください instead Where's the missing link in my reasoning And finally, how does the 〜ないで form match with ください
Consider these stanzas taken from the opening song of Aria the Animation: Undine.Translations taken from this siteBackground information: An Undine as a mythical concept is a female water spirit or nymph. In the anime "Aria", they are what gondola operators are called. (In layman terms they are boat rowers)Vocative case: the case used for a noun identifying the person or thing (animal, object, etc.) being addressed.さあ　漕ぎ出そう　光る波へ笑顔が　すぐ　こぼれる (Come, let us row towards the shimmering waves,  our smiles will soon overflow.)ねえ　伝えよう　このときめき (Hey, let us impart the feelings of our beating hearts. )風にのって　あなたのもとへ行くわ　ウンディーネ (Riding the wind, I will return to you  as an Undine.)さあ　漕ぎ出そう　遥か未来へ水面に　夢　広がる (Come, let us row towards that distant future;  our dreams will spread out over the water.)ねえ　見つけよう　まだ知らない 宝物を　あなたと一緒に (Hey, let us discover yet unknown treasures.)探そう　ウンディーネ (Together with you  as Undines.)I disagree with translation in the highlighted parts above.(Question) Can it mean "Riding the wind, I will return to you, my Undine" and "Together with you, my Undine" Treating ウンディーネ as vocative case
Consider the following:このりんご（ は / が ）食べないでください。Person A: どちらが東ですか。　Person B：　こちら（ は / が ）東です。Workbook answers are は for 1. and が for 2.In 1., I would expect the person to be pointing at the apple or at least gesturing with body language towards the apple. Furthermore the apple is physically present within proximity of the speaker as evidenced by use of "この". Therefore the apple is already present in the "universe of discourse" and the use of は to extract it from the "universe of discourse" is justified.In 2., Discourse is introduced by person A. The workbook chooses が as the correct answer. (Observations) The apple is tangible while direction is intangible. However, both are present in the "universe of discourse". "Direction" is part of "immediate environment" and I should always be able to refer to immediate environment using は since it's shared information between two parties.(Question) Can't I similarly take "direction" as already present in the "universe of discourse" and use は to refer to it in 2.EDIT: Concept of "Universe of Discourse" taken from jkerian's answer
Does it make sense to have an i-adjective (in て-form) immediately before 「ください」 For example, when asked to choose between hot and cold coffee, can I use 「温かくてください」, or must I turn it into nominal phrase (温かいのをください)Another example, is it fine to say 「優しくてください」, or must I insert a て-verb before ください (優しくしてください)

I am under impression that the first syllable in a word gets a dakuten when it is transformed into voiced form under the effect of rendaku. But in the idiomatic expression 様みろ {ざまみろ}, the kanji 様 which is read as さま gets voiced and obtains the dakuten without any rendaku. How did that happen Apart from saying "well, it's a set phrase so just accept it as is", could there be any reason, etymologically speaking, why it became ざまAlso, are there any other scenario where words get voiced/dakuten without rendaku

Both けもの and けだもの are written in kanji as 獣, but is the beast with 'だ' inside more brutal than the one without 'だ' Or are they simply two variants of the same noun, thus they refer to exactly the same type of beasts If they are the same word, why is 獣道 only read as けものみち but not けだものみち

Regarding written English that isn't proofread ... it's quality definately leaves alot to be desired. I would advise people against treating written English that wasn't professionally written (for example, mailing lists or Stack Overflow questions) as good English.Am I likely to pick up bad spelling or grammar from Japanese that is written by native speakers but isn't professionally writtenAssume that I'm reading somewhat serious material, such as the ruby-dev mailing list, rather than YouTube comments.I'm not really planning on learning spelling and grammar from them, just practicing reading the kana within the emails, but I don't want to mis-train myself (learn something that isn't correct) by accident.I've also heard warnings not to learn from Japanese done by the opposite sex - sadly, I don't think there'd be too large a risk of that with a programming mailing list!
I noticed in many anime I watched that 「言っただろう」 is often contracted into 「言ったろ」 in conversations between friends and families. I'm guessing this contraction is both colloquial and standard (as in, everyone understands it).But I'm wondering if this contraction of 「だろう」 is limited to the phrase 「言っただろう」 only. Is there any instance where 「だろう」 gets contracted before other past tense verbs than 「言った」, e.g. 来たろ

(drum roll, please)... C, 金銭{きんせん}.First, I'm a little vague on the meaning of 金銭{きんせん}. Seems to just mean "money", but how is it different from just saying 金{かね}More importantly, while it does fit as an answer, I don't clearly see why it's a better answer than B, 大金{たいきん} (can also be read おおがね), which means "a large amount of money". To me it makes more sense that a large amount of money is more of a motive for murder than just money in general.Why is 金銭{きんせん} a better answer than 大金{たいきん}Rough translation of the question:Select the appropriate wordIt appears that underneath this incident of murder there was  some trouble with (  ).A An amount of money  B a large amount of money  C  money()  D a fund
Hi all I was wondering  if we want  to treat a quoted phrase as a "noun", is it necessary to put a と particle behind the quoted phraseFor example: A) The "received" in "received from Tom"「トムから頂きます」の「頂きます」, or「トムから頂きます」との「頂きます」 B) The "tadaki" in "itadakimasu"「いただきます」の「ただき」, or「いただきます」との「ただき」 Basically I was trying also just to figure out how should we know whether or not to put a と particle after a quote
Consider the following:[1] 僕は日本人ではなく,　シンガポール人です。　(I'm not Japanese, I'm Singaporean)[2] 僕は日本人ではないが, シンガポール人です。 (I'm not Japanese but Singaporean)Comparing my sentences to the worked examples in my grammar practice workbook, [1] would be correct while [2] would be wrong.(Question) Is [2] a valid sentence(Side Question) Can I read ではなく as じゃなく
I was at a Japanese restaurant called 星岡 (ほしがおか). And I was trying to figure out what the が does in it. I instinctively translated it to "Starry hill" (Not sure of my translation though).(Question) What does が do in this case Or is it simply 名乗り and I shouldn't think too much into it.
I always hear ～なぁと思った, but I don't know if it comes from:食べるかなーと思った。 or likeきれいだなーと思った。 or寒いなーと思った。I think this sound　なーと思う is so relaxing and so nice, that I want to use it. But actually I would like to know how is used and where.Related to it, I was thinking if we can use a suffix before と思う, like:そのパソコンは高いねと思ってた。I was thinking how expensive is that computer (is it ok)あの道は危なくないさと思う。I think that street is safe.。。。

What generally accepted mnemonic phrases are there in Japanese that are used for memorizing a sequence of numbers or words
In the following, I feel it should be 会話が出来るどころか.ジムは日本語で会話が出来ないどころか、簡単な挨拶も出来ない。  Jim is not only unable to converse in Japanese; he cannot even make simple greetings.I was expecting the sentence to end talking about how well Jim can speak Japanese. If this is a valid usage, can you please give a more literal translation
I've recently discovered that certain particles could be omitted from a Japanese sentence (to help make it shorter), and still preserve the original meaning. Unfortunately, most resources about this topic that I've looked at are vague at best; and some even contradict each other! This question is really a few sub questions (but I really don't think each one deserves its own thread since they're so closely related.) The answers don't have to be too detailed; just general points are fine. Anyways, the things I'd like to know are:Which particles can be omitted from sentencesDoes the omission of particles make a sentence informal/impoliteWhen can particles be dropped (e.g. How can you decide that it's okay both socially and grammatically)Can multiple particles be dropped in a single sentenceI hope someone can shed some light on this subject. Thanks! :)
I was told how an older non-native lady would say "it's okay!" and that it was perceived to be just like that person and cute many because it was grammatically incorrect. She would say, いいだよNow I didn't know that rule but I was sure I had heard いいだよ before. It is such a simple statement but even these things trip me up. So I'm guessing the rule is like だ after な-adjectives, nounsNo だ after い-adjectives Can I get something definitive on this pleaseWhat about adverbs
Using　あまりに（も）　in a sentence with 過ぎる, is it redundant because they both mean too much/excessiveIn the following example stolen from Lukman (thank you), does the sentence change if you drop the あまりに Ex: 料理にあまりに時間がかかりすぎる。 Cooking takes up too much time.
「彼は映画スターであり、政治家もだ。」 means "He is a movie star, and a politician is a movie star, too" (from Tsuyoshi's comment below this other post)「彼は映画スターであり、政治家でもある。」 means "He is a movie star and also a politician." (Source)If we were to replace だ with である in (1), we have: 「彼は映画スターであり、政治家もである」. Sawa suggests that で has to be attached to a noun for a sentence to be grammatical, so after swapping the positions of も and で, we have: 「彼は映画スターであり、政治家でもある」.What I cannot understand is why does replacing だ to である (and applying the necessary で and も swap) changes the meaning of the sentence
WWWJDIC lists both あまりに and あまりにも to mean "too much; excessively; too" but are they exactly the same in term of usage and nuanceあまりに 《余りに》 (adv) (uk) too much; excessively; tooEx: 料理にあまりに時間がかかりすぎる。 Cooking takes up too much time.あまりにも 《余りにも》 (adv) (uk) too much; excessive; tooEx: それは彼にとってはあまりにも易しすぎる仕事だ。 It is too easy a task for him.Can they be used interchangeably
In a manga I am currently reading, one of the character exclaims:安心しな。秘密に しとく から。The general meaning of the second part ("I'll keep it a secret") is quite obvious, and it seems that "しとく" (ostensibly derived from し, with a suffix appended) has more or less the same meaning as plain "する". But I am curious about the grammatical (or dialectal) construct used here, its usage, nuance etc.The closest to an explanation I could find, was this verb in WWWJDIC:とく  (v5k) to do something in readiness for, to get something (needful) done... but I must admit I'm still at a loss as to why it would be used as an auxiliary here.What is the exact nuance (and grammatical origin) of that "しとく" and does the "とく" suffix work with other verbs
In rather formal situations, when would you use 頂戴します I use いただきます all the time to express the fact of receiving something, but I just heard a colleague using 頂戴します over the phone.If I understand well, this page suggests 頂戴します is when receiving material merchandise.
In English it would be strange to have more than one "WH question" word in a sentence,For example:Tomorrow, where are we meeting, at what time and to do what It sounds like it's grammatical English, but nevertheless it sure sounds odd (or an intentional joke) at best.In Japanese, what is the stand on sentences that has  more than one "WH" word e.g:明日、何時にどこで何をしに会いますか。
Today as I was transferring trains in Nagoya the station attendant was shouting repeatedly「ありがとうございや」. Doing a search on the internet revealed that this seems to be a shorted form of ありがとうございやした but I have never heard of this before.    Is this from a specific dialect/age group/groupIs it's usage just a simple replacement of 「ま」in 「～ました」Can this be done to any verb, or is it limited to 「る」ending verbs that conjugate to 「い」in 丁寧語 (polite speech)
The 〜そう form means "seemingly 〜" and is usually conjecture made based on first-hand information.  This usually means seeing something or hearing about something and making a conjecture, e.g., おいしそう when seeing the food. (Presumably, first-hand information would extend to ESP, psychic visions, etc., if you believe in that.)Now, it's hard to imagine that this would ever apply to かわいい based on visual first-hand information; since you're actually seeing the thing, there's no guessing about whether or not it's cute.  However, it would be possible to make a "seemingly cute" conjecture if the first-hand information was hearing a description of something.  For example, maybe your friend is describing their new puppy to you.  Upon hearing the description you might respond that it seems cute.By the rules, かわいい (sometimes written 可愛い) would then become かわいそう【可愛そう】.  Unfortunately, this coincides with かわいそう【可哀相】 meaning "pathetic; pitiful; sad".Is the "seemingly cute" かわいそう even used practically in the way I mentioned (or some other way)If so, is context enough to distinguish which of the two words it's actually supposed to be  Or should you just avoid it altogether  Because I can think of a context where it would still be ambiguous."My new puppy is small, and fluffy, and likes to play ball.  But a cat attacked him the other day"."かわいそう"　→　(Is it "Seems cute" or "Poor thing")
I finally started going through some JLPT N1 grammar the other day, and one of the ones I'm looking at has me a bit confused: the ～にあって・～にあっても form. The book describes its usage as such:～のような特別の状況・時期・場所だからこそあることが起こるThe 時期 and 場所 parts I can understand, but my problem is with the 状況 side of things. The problem this arose on was this:木村氏は（　　）にあって、日々多忙なスケジュールをこなしている。The choices(the ones that make sense, that is) are:１　一国の指導者２　一国の指導者という立場The answer is #2 - can anyone explain to me why It seems like the first one is describing a 状況, but apparently not - at least, not more than 立場 does. Or is that 立場 referring to a placeEDIT - Since 立場 is the right answer, can someone say why 一国の指導者 is not actually a 特別な状況 Also, why does 立場 fall into the proper category
Last night, when I asked my wife to send an email to me, she said もう送っている which I took to mean that she was "sending the message". (The message had a big attachment so I imagined that it could take a few minutes to be sent.) What I later realized is that in this context 送っている meant that "the message has been sent". I thought that Vている is the same as a progressive or -ing form in English. According to my wife, if she wanted to say she was sending the message it would have been, 送っているところ.Is it true that the 送っている always means continuation of state (ie. "has been sent") or does it depend on the context Other verbs in the Vている form (for example 食べている) seem to mean continuation of action (ie. "eating"). Does the meaning of Vている change depending on the verb it's used with Can we divide every verb into a "continuation of state" or a "continuation of action" category or is it more complicatedFinally, where does てある fit into all of this. From my textbook grammar, I would have thought 送ってある would be the correct phrase for "it has been sent".Related question: If Vて+いる isn't a gerund, then what is it
In one of the Bleach anime ending songs, "Hanabi" has the following line:繋ぎゆく この想い 愛しき 君"itoshiki" seems to come from "itoshii", but how does this -ki form of i-adjective work I found a few other adjectives that have -ki forms, e.g. 幼き{おさなき}, 素晴らしき{すばらしき}, 古き{ふるき}, 良き{よき} etc but that's about it. Is this form productive Is it selective, i.e. only some i-adjectives can have this form Or has it become archaic, and thus only limited to those that survived into present Japanese
Does マシ come from English Or is it a semantic emphasis

If it is just close my question.I want to know what anime do you recommend to learn japanese The problem with the anime I've watch so far is that they tend to speak pretty casual and some of them use yakuza way to talk. Is there any appropriate anime for those who want to learn Japanese or should I give up on anime and learn from a different media (drama, news, etc.).I don't pretend to learn only from listening (I've been studying japanese for about 5 years). It's just that I think that learning any language is not only reading books.
In saying that something doesn't exist, is it unusual to use the ga particle (が) and a negative verb For example, would "(Uchi ni) Terebi ga arimasen" be an unusual way to say "There isn't a TV (at my house)"The reason I'm wondering is that lesson 8 of Japanese For Busy People, which introduces the ga particle and the existence of people and things, teaches "place ni noun ga arimasu/imasu" to say "The object exists at this location!". (If you were talking about a noun whose existance was already known, and you were just providing additional information, it currently suggests using "wa" and "desu" - eg "terebi wa ookii desu" - "the television is big")Also, at the start of chapter 9, it teaches "place ni noun ga arimasu ka", and tells you how to do the positive answer "Hai, noun ga arimasu".However, it doesn't teach "noun ga arimasen/imasen" to say "The object doesn't exist!". The only time it mentions the negative form is with "Nani mo arimasen" and "Dare mo imasen", which is to say that nothing or no-one exists at a specific location.Since it doesn't teach "noun ga arimasen/imasen", I'm wondering if it's because that's not grammatically correct.
So, I have the sentence礼儀のひとつも見せたらどうだね騎士殿I am getting stumped on the どうだ part. If I am reading the slang dictionary correctly (and I can only find it in a non-English one), it seems to be slang for どや顔, which I can't find in other dictionaries (although split, it seems to mean "cheap lodging face(person)"), and then it says「どうだ？」という意味で使われる方言。語尾をあげてWhich as far as I can tell, means that it is a suffix of some kind as part of a dialect. It's not very specific, and seems to leave the sentence incomplete. Google Translate says it means "it do".So my understanding of this is hindered by conflicting alternate translations and the possibility of it being dialect-specific. Can anyone get me on the right trackIf it helps, the previous thing the character said was something like "What sort of attitude lets you enter [my apartment] at your convenience"The full slang dictionary entry is this:どや顔（どやがお） - 日本語俗語辞書【年代】 2007年 【種類】 †『どや顔』の解説どや顔の『どや』とは関西方面で「どうだ？」という意味で使われる方言。語尾をあげて「どや？」と聞くこの言葉、何かが完成したりAnd it highlighted the portion that matched my search.I hope this question isn't too narrow-focused.
In Chinese letter writing there is a phrase "教祺" that can be roughly translated as "good luck in teaching" and is used exclusively in the letter ending greeting. Is there a counterpart in Japanese letter writing Or is wishing the teacher's health good enoughEdit: found a rather long list of letter greetings and cannot find anything specific to teachers.
私の祖母は私が欲しい以上のものをくれた私の祖母は私が欲しがる以上のものをくれたI want the meaning to be "my grandmother gave me more then I wanted." Is the second sentence right and the first sentence wrongI learned 欲しがる for the third person, but I found the second example as a first person example. Which is correct
What are the differences among the following two-kanji words that seem to mean "eternity":永遠 {えいえん}永久 {とわ}永世 {えいせい}永代 {えいたい}永劫 {えいごう}永永 {えいえい}久遠 {きゅうえん}悠久 {ゆうきゅう}恒久 {こうきゅう}恒常 {こうじょう}長久 {ちょうきゅう}無窮 {むきゅう}Please include any other related words (preferably two-kanji only) but please exclude those that make use of period of a lifetime like 一生, 末代 etc, or big number of years/era like 千代, 万古 etc.p/s: I noticed that the first two 永遠 and 永久 are the most commonly used; is it true and why them instead of the others
Textbooks usually teach that 花見 / お花見 means "cherry blossom viewing".Tatoeba has a couple of examples supporting that:ヒラヒラと桜の花が舞っている。もうお花見の季節も終わりだな It looks like cherry blossom-viewing season is at an end. You can see the petals flutteringdown.水戸市は花見客でいっぱいだった。 The city of Mito was crowded with blossom viewers.私は花見に行ってきました。 I have been to see the cherry blossoms.花見ができる春が待ち遠しい。 I can't wait for spring to come so we can sit under the cherry trees.お花見に行きませんか。 Why don't we go and see the cherry blossoms[source]Must 花見 / お花見 refer only to "cherry blossom" viewingCan they be used for "flower viewing" in general
What are differences among 第一, 一番 and 第一番, all of which seem to mean "the first" in English Are any of them more suitable for some specific scenarios than the others (e.g. 安全第一 but 世界で一番)
Hearing the word 小悪魔 used here and there, I had always foolishly assumed that the addition of that '小' in front, made it a much more harmless, playful, version of the real thing. And consequently, calling someone (with whom one is familiar enough, of course) '小悪魔', would be akin to using the literal equivalent in English, where nobody would ever be offended at being called a "little devil".However, recent conversations have sown the seeds of doubt in my mind, and upon checking the dictionary (what I should have done earlier), I find that the official definition given by WWWJDIC is:小悪魔 [こあくま]  (n,adj-na) (col) rogue, devil, imp... which has zero playfulness to it, and sounds about just as bad as calling somebody "Satan" or "the Devil" (悪魔 without 小).My question is therefore: How strong (and potentially offensive) is the word in a casual context Does it have any of the "harmless naughtiness" overtones a clueless English speaker might expect from such a term
So, we have the kanji 上・下 which can be read as either かみ・しも or うえ・した, and as I understand it, those two are antonym pairs. But what are the differences between the twoThe thesaurus isn't very helpful. For instance, it says, for うえ何かとくらべて高い方の位置、場所。and for かみ it says位置が高いこと。また、ひと続きのものの初め。川では上流、和歌などでは前半をいう。If I understand this correctly, this is saying that うえ is simply the place or position above some reference level, while かみ is the state of being above, or the start of a series. But the dictionary entry for かみ goes on to give definitions like位置の高い所。which bring it right back into the territory of うえ, or at least very close. It almost looks like the distinction is supposed to be relative vs absolute, but this just confuses me since, at least in my mind, above/below are inherently relative. Question. What are the differences between かみ・しも and うえ・した Are there minimal pairs illustrating these differences
What are the differences when using the following words/phrases to mean "perhaps", "maybe" or "probably"多分恐らく蓋し {けだし}もしかしてひょっとしてなかろう (negative -&gt; probably not)だろう / でしょう / であろうかも知れないPlease add any other words/phrases that provide similar meanings.N.B I hope istrasci doesn't mind me using his favorite question title pattern here :P
I have some untranslated mangas that come in pairs of two, and each of them is labeled with 上 or 下 to denote which is the first volume and which is the second. I'm wondering if these labels are only used for pairs of two or can also be used for trilogies, maybe in the order of 上 - 中 - 下 perhaps, but I don't have access to library or bookstore for Japanese books to verify. So, are the usage 上 and 下 as labels only limited to books/movies/etc that come in pairs of twop/s: On related note, in ダンゴ３兄弟, the eldest dango is 長男, the second is 次男 and the youngest is 三男. If they were actually ダンゴ二兄弟 instead, would they be labelled with 上 and 下 instead I think I've heard "上の子" or "下の子" being said but I'm not sure if they are referring to the order of siblings or something else.
A novel I'm reading contains this snippet of dialogue. The manager of a love hotel is explaining why she doesn't return to her apartment between shifts:帰ったって何があるってわけじゃなし、誰が待っているわけじゃなし、ホテルの仮眠室で寝て、起きてそのまま仕事をすることの方が多い。Does the わけじゃなし here parse to "わけ　じゃ　無し", or is she dropping the ”い”　in "わけ　じゃ　ない　し" Just in case it might be relevant, she speaks very colloquially, and is from the Yamagata countryside, although I can't detect any particular regionalisms in her speech. The setting is Tokyo.If it is "わけ　じゃ　無し", how does it work grammatically{EDIT-ADDENDUM} For anyone who's interested, I asked a native speaker about this, and his impression was that "わけじゃなし" adds an edge of scorn (「ばかにする」 is the way he put it) that "わけじゃないし" doesn't have, but with the same meaning. He also reckoned that it derives from "無し", although, personally, I still think that's an open question. Where's an etymologist when you need one
In many Indo-European ancient languages, there used to be a strong connection between the words for right and left on one side and the words for south and north1 (respectively) on the other side.This suggests that the sacred orientation used to be facing eastwards - in the direction of the rising sun2.  In Chinese instead the character 左 (zuǒ) means both left and east (an older version than 東/东) while instead 右 (yòu) means both right and west (an older character than 西).  In this case, this seems to suggest a preferred orientation towards the south.I have, in light of this preamble, the following questions.Are there any evidence for ひだり (hidari) or みぎ (migi) being used in the sense of east and west respectivelyIf not, are there any older words for left and right that would be used in the sense of cardinal directions (whether in the Chinese way or in the Indo European way)Note 1:For instance:  Celtic languages: Gaelic : deas (south and right); Gaulish dexsiuo (south and right); Old Irish desse (south and right); Welsh de (south and right); Breton *dehou Sanskit daksinah (south and right), Avestan dashina (south and right)  Ancient Latin scaevus and Archaic Greek σκαιὀς (meaning both "left" the side of the shadow).Note 2:Other indications include:  European Bronze Age tombs generally orientated towards the east.  The word orientate itself.Orientation of ancient maps towards the east.
The i-adjective はやい can refer to being fast or being early, but each of the meanings has affinity towards separate kanji: 速い (fast) and 早い (early). Yet, while it's not surprising that the antonyms of both 速い and 早い have the same pronunciation おそい, both おそい that means "slow" and "late" seems to share the same kanji: 遅い. Although WWWJDIC and dictionary@goo both include 鈍い as an alternative kanji for おそい, it does not seem to have affinity towards any of the two meanings either.Is this really the case that the same kanji form can refer to both meanings, or were there separate kanji for each (maybe abolished during the reform or something)
According to people I've asked, and this page, if I pay 20 Australian dollars for my meal, it seems I say ni ju doru (20-ドル), and that ni ju-en doru (20-えん-ドル) would be ungrammatical - "dollar" acts as the counter.Is it possible to refer to the Australian dollar as a noun in other circumstances (eg while talking about how the dollar fared on the exchange market) If so, is this only because it's a loanword, or can the same apply with native Japanese words
Are there any differences between using おしまい {oshimai} and おわり {owari} to mean "the end" (both with neutral and negative connotations) Are they always interchangeableE.g:テスト失敗したらおわりだぜ。テスト失敗したらおしまいだぜ。
Following hot on the heels on my other question about と and 思う, I know と can be used with 言う, but can it also be applied to verbs that imply some kind of thinking process other than 思うDo these make grammatical senseあそこに行くと決めた【あそこに　いくと　きめた】 (I decided, "I'll go over there")あそこに行くと考えた【あそこに　いくと　かんがえた】 (I considered, "I'll go over there")あそこに行くと感じた【あそこに　いくと　かんじた】 (I felt, "I'll go over there")If so, are there other verbs that might take と to imply a thought process behind the action
Compare the following two sentences:あそこに[行]{い}こうと[思]{おも}っているあそこに[行]{い}こうを[思]{おも}っているIf I'm right about this, they both mean that the speaker is thinking of going somewhere.However, the difference is that in the first case, the use of と indicates the speaker is literally saying those words in their mind. The English translation would be:I'm thinking, "I'll go over there."In the second case, を indicates that the speaker is not literally thinking those words, so it's not a quote of their thoughts, it's just a description of their thoughts. So the English translation would be:I'm thinking of going over there.I think this is right, but somehow the second one looks really awkward to me, so it doesn't feel right in some way.Is my intuition correct that there is something grammatically wrong with it... should it be が instead of を
I learned in Tae Kim's Grammar Guide that だ cannot be used when asking a question. But in the book Japanese Sentence Patterns for Effective Communication by Taeko Kamiya, I found several example sentences that used だ in a question. I also have seen it being used this way in anime.I'm guessing there is some type of exception to all of this Anyways, I hope someone can shed some light on the subject for me. :)== EDIT ==Here is an example from the aforementioned book:どうしてゆうべ来なかったんだ？ (Why didn't you come last night)And here is an example from the title of the 249th episode of the show Dragon Ball Z:悟飯はどこだ! (Where's Gohan!)
I would like to know a bit more about the "ねば" grammatical construction.Every now and then, I hear people say sentences like東京に行かねばならぬ粘々丼を食べねば倒れるなんとかせねばいいIt's quite clear that ねば means the same as なければ, butIs it a shorten form of なければ, or a different constructionIs it an old form, or something that has been around for 20 years or soIs its usage limited to some regions ages social classesHow (in)formal is itIs it like なきゃ and なくちゃ (as far as usage is concerned, not nuances)
I'm not sure what this example sentence is trying to teach. The translation is really throwing me off.易しい漢字も書けなりました  I cannot even write easy kanji anymoreI see the "even ... easy kanji" and the "anymore" in なりました, but where's the cannot coming from
What is the role of と particle in 「二度としない」 Is it quotative, adverbialisation, change of state or supposition Also, what extra nuances does it contribute to the expression compared to if も is used instead (二度もしない)

How to say "workaround/quick-and-dirty hack" in Japanese in the context of computer programmingALC says 次善策 for "workaround" but of course it does not convey the sense of dirtiness/fragility/speed I am looking for.Context: quick email about a software feature, to my superior, with whom I am on very friendly terms but still use -ます form for instance.
It's not the first time I hear it, but I've found it in this scene. I understand that, as in 知る or 始まる, a started action whose consequence remains is expressed in continuous form. However, I thought that the negative form was constructed in present or past, as 知らない　or 始まらなかった, but not in continuous. I find examples as the linked video using instead the negation of the continuous （見ていない）. In this case I would've used 「見なかった」.Am I missing something or is it a slang transformation In that case, which form should be usedThanks a lot!FerranEDIT: corrected misspelling/bad grammar. Tremendous lapsus :(
There are verbs with irregular humble forms, e.g. the humble form of 借りる is 拝借する.For these verbs, are the "normal humble conjugations" still used, or considered grammaticalWould お借りする be acceptableSimilarly, there are verbs with irregular honorific forms, e.g. the honorific form of 食べる is 召し上がる.For these verbs, are the "normal honorific conjugations" still used, or considered grammaticalWould お食べになる and お食べです be acceptable
There are a few compound nouns that are made by compounding something with na-adjectives like 好き and 嫌い, for examples:花見好き子供好き水嫌い人嫌い負け嫌いAre these compounds followed by a な particle Or do they lose the na-adjective status and become 名詞 nouns (followed by a の particle)水嫌い な 犬   or  水嫌い の 犬
Often times at the gym, when I'm on my way out, covered in sweat, one of the staff will say お疲{つか}れ様{さま}です ("you've worked hard"...).Usually at work situations, I've often found that saying some variant of お疲{つか}れ back makes sense, because we're usually in the same situation or we're finishing at the same time.However, in this case, they're working and I'm a customer, so I'm never quite sure how to respond. Saying some variant of お疲れ back to them doesn't seem right, as they are still working.I feel a little weird saying ありがとう (thanks) or something like that, because it seems to be acknowledging my own efforts ("why yes, I have worked hard!"), which doesn't seem quite right.What would be the right response
This is something I first noticed when I was at an aquarium in Japan (as evidenced in my examples) and continued to see ever since.  There are certain pairs of animals, that while extremely similar, have certain distinguishing characteristics such that English speakers (well, most anyway) know them apart; or at least that they are different animals even if they don't know which is which.Disclaimer - I'm no animal expert, so I may mix up these pairs, but I'll try to Google them to be sure.For example, alligators and crocodiles.  English speakers know these are different even if they're not sure what the differences are.  Alligators have broader, rounder snouts, while crocodiles have longer, pointier snouts.  Also something about the teeth.  But in Japanese, they're both just ワニ.  I asked my Japanese friend, and he said the average Japanese person doesn't know this difference or is even aware that they are considered different animals.Here are several other pairs that seem to just get lumped together in the same Japanese word (by the average person):Turtle (flat wide shell) vs. Tortoise (large dome shell)　→　亀【カメ】Seals (have fur; concave ears) vs. Sea Lions (smooth body; protruding ears)　→　アシカDolphin (have a "beak"; spiky teeth) vs. Porpoise (no beak; flat teeth)　→　イルカEven pairs that are blatantly different often get grouped:Crab vs. Lobster　→　カニ (not sure if Japanese people use ロブスター or not)Mouse vs. Rat　→　ネズミMonkey vs. Ape　→　猿【サル】There are many other examples, but these are the only ones I can think of right now.  I'm sure the 学名 are different, but like I said, it seems like the average Japanese person doesn't make, or even know of a difference in these pairs.  Why is this
I've often seen 「食べる」 used, when should we use 「食う」  Are these two interchangeable  Can you provide examples
Having picked up about 2,000+ characters from Chinese, one of the fastest ways for me to acquire a feel for Japanese grammar and word order, as well as some useful kanji readings, has been to study classical Chinese texts in kanbun. Yet I constantly struggle with the resources available to me. I know that there have been some multi-volume collections of kanbun which ought to be in the public domain, like the 漢文叢書. But I can't seem to find a good online resource. Ideally, I'd like to be able to pick any classical Chinese text and study a kanbun reading of said text.
In their comment to an answer on the question "Are foreign personal names usually written in katakana rather than Romaji", user sawa says:... Chinese names should be written in kanji rather than katakana and read by the Japanese pronunciation. For example, 金大中 is キムデジュン, not きんだいちゅう, but 毛沢東 is もうたくとう, not マオジードン. ...This got me wondering, since each Japanese character generally has at least two readings is there always one clear reading for pronouncing such namesI expect of course that the "on" readings would be used, but often there is more than one on reading for the same character.From the comments so far (no answers yet) this is indeed very interesting, and on Zhen Lin's prompting I would like to include Korean names as well despite their being discounted in the older linked question.
When expressing "It takes about 1 hour and 15 minutes", would it be best to say１時間１５分掛かる。or１時１５分掛かる。or maybe１時１５分間掛かる。
From early on, I've used こら and ほら somewhat interchangeably. They both mean "hey!"I picked them up from friends early on without really having a sense of the difference.Now, after some time, I've come to understand that ほら is simply "hey!", as in just getting someone's attention, and こら is "hey" with a flavour of "dude, what the hell" mixed in.The thing is, I still tend to slip and use こら when maybe I should say ほら, and vice versa. Old habits die hard.My question is, when I mix up and say こら instead of ほら, how bad is it
Earlier today my friend and I were looking for a restaurant that someone had recommended we go to. We couldn't find it, and so my friend suggested I should check again with the person who recommended the place about where it is located.In telling me to check with my other friend, the Japanese friend I was with said:場所を聞いておく。【ばしょを　きいて　おく】My very loose translation is "you should ask [them] the place."This is a classic case of what I encounter a lot which is that I get the meaning enough to know what is being asked and how to respond, but I can't claim to understand completely. I don't exactly know what おく is doing here.I know that おく, usually means "to place", as in to put something in a place and leave it here. However, it also means, "to do in advance".So I assume it's something like that second meaning being used here, but, if so, do what in advance of what, exactly Ask my friend in advance of attempting to go to the restaurant a second time That seems logical, but it also seems like a lot of assumed context and extra information to store in one verb.What exactly is おく doing when attached to 聞いて
Consider these example sentences given by my grammar dictionary:(1) 私はデパートへ贈り物を買いに行った。(2) そこへ何をしに行くんですか。Observation: The location is marked by へ instead of に.Considering that a sentence such as デパートに行く is grammatical,if the locations in (1) and (2) are marked by に, two にs would be present in the same sentence.(Question): Can the location in (1) and (2) be marked by に Would two にs cause the sentence to be ungrammatical
For those who might not be familiar with the series Tintin (soon to be in a major motion picture, by the way), there is a character named Captain Haddock who is famous for shouting out colourful exclamations when he gets upset.His signature exclamation when he's surprised or angry is "Blue blistering barnacles!". At least, that's what it is in English. I don't know what the original French would be. In any case, it's just sort of an arbitrary thing to shout.In Japanese, his trademark exclamation is made into 「コンコンニャローのバーロー岬！」.(In the panel above, he is looking at a ship in the harbour, and the ship has raised a flag saying it is in quarantine, and he's just shouting his surprise, the same way one would yell "Oh no!" or something like that.)This is obviously not a direct translation of the English (or the French, I assume), and I know it's just an equivalently arbitrary colourful thing to say. However, I'm struggling to parse exactly what he is saying.I know the last バーロー is probably just a katakanization of the name "Barlow", and 岬【みさき】 is "cape," as in the coastal geographical feature. So it ends on "Cape Barlow".I'm thinking the コンニャロー is an abbreviated この野郎【このやろう】, which translates to something like "you rascal", or worse, depending on how severe you think the context is.The first コン really throws me. I don't think it's just a stutter, because he says it this way each and every time. Even in some other cases where he does clearly stutter, this repetition is still preserved.The use of の throws me a bit too, as I struggle a bit with the use of の in general.I can't make it come together. What is he shouting
I found this adjective from 7!!'s song 「ラヴァーズ」(Lovers):無邪気なるDictionary entries categorises 無邪気 as a noun and な-adjective.For reference, I shall extract parts from two different stanzas in the song. They share the same rhythmic structure and melody:君は今 涙流した泣きじゃくる子供のようにたとえ未来(あす)が見えなくなっても守るよ夏の空見上げてニラんだ君の手を強く握った無邪気なる子供のようにたとえ時間(とき)が現在(いま)を奪ってもススムよ夏の空目指して走ったObservations: The parts in bold both are 5 syllables and both end in るConjecture: The songwriter used 無邪気なる to be more poetic and lyrical. (Because without "る" it just "would not fit")I understand that present day な-adj results from なる-adj which in turn results from classical Japanese's なり copula, and some なる-adjectives (like 単なる) survived.(Question) Can we produce なる-adjectives by "regressing" な-adjectives Are there any guidelines that prevents or allows us to produce なる-adjectives
Are foreign personal names usually written in katakana, or is this dependent on the type or writing, and the target audience For example, this Japanese Wikipedia entry on Steven Bradbury uses katakana, while this Wikipedia entry on JRuby uses romaji for the contributors.
Japanese has some sets of characters which look very similar or even identical. Obviously, context is usually more than enough to distinguish which character is intended, but I'm wondering if there are subtle differences which can be used to disambiguate. It's easy enough to compare characters in computer fonts, so my question is really more about handwriting.ー (katakana), 一 (kanji) and — (em dash)The first two can be distinguished from the last one in Minchō-type fonts, and usually it is possible to distinguish between all three. In vertical writing the katakana bō and the em dash are oriented vertically so is easily distinguished from the kanji ichi. What about in handwriting or Gothic-type fonts I suspect they are indistinguishable then, but counterexamples are welcome.ロ (katakana) and 口 (kanji)In print, katakana ro is usually printed a little bit smaller than kanji kuchi. In some of the fonts I have the final stroke of katakana ro protrudes to the right, while the penultimate stroke of kanji kuchi protrudes downwards.カ (katakana) and 力 (kanji)Like the above, katakana ka is usually printed a little bit smaller than kanji chikara; but I've also noticed that the little hook is subtly different for katakana ka, and that in some fonts katakana ka has a bit of a rightward slant or curvature.ニ (katakana) and 二 (kanji)エ (katakana) and 工 (kanji)タ (katakana) and 夕 (kanji)ト (katakana) and 卜 (kanji)Other than size, it seems like the only way to distinguish these pairs in Minchō-type fonts is to rely on the tendency for katakana to have more brush-like strokes than the kanji.ハ (katakana) and 八 (kanji)These are usually easy to distinguish in print, even in brush-type fonts, since the last stroke of katakana ha is of a different type from the last stroke of kanji hachi. What about in handwriting え (hiragana) and 之 (kanji)These are easily distinguished in print and good handwriting, but I have trouble making them distinct in my handwriting.へ (hiragana) and ヘ (katakana)Is there any difference between these two They are identical in Hiragino Mincho, for instance...

Is it possible to tell whether a word would be written in kanji or if it would be written in hiragana without actually reading it, like it is reasonably easy to tell if a word is likely to be written in katakana (An example for katakana would be "this is an English loanword so it's probably written in katakana")Background: The kana version of Japanese for Busy People 1 uses only kana - it doesn't have kanji with furigana, and I'm wondering if not knowing which words are really hiragana, and which are not really hiragana would be a problem.
I already know the main usages of の as said here, but I was wondering: If I want to use the possessive indicator in a row, is it correctFor example, if I wanted to say "My family's car is blue.", could I write something like this example私の家族の車は水色です。And are there restrictions or alternatives to this I'm not aware of
Consider the following sentence:お金じゃないところが好きだから一緒にいるの【おかね　じゃない　ところが　すき　だから　いっしょに　いるの】I think it means "I'm with you because of the parts of you that don't have to do with money".I'm wondering about the use of ところ here. It seems to mean the same thing as what こと was said to mean in this question, which is a vague collection of qualities that a person can have.Question one: Does ところ mean exactly the same thing as こと here, or are there differences Would 「お金じゃないことが好きだから一緒にいるの」 change the meaningQuestion two: I think this question refers specifically to a person who may or not have money, because of a wider context. However, from purely a grammatical point of view, could it also mean "I don't like things to do with money, so that's why I'm with you" In other words, the speaker is expressing more about the fact they aren't materialistic, as opposed to commenting on the resources of the person being spoken to.Question three: If you read this statement without other context, would you assume that the person being spoken to does not have money, and the speaker likes that person in spite of that fact Or, would you assume the person being spoken to may or may not have money, but either way it is not relevant to the speakerBonus question: I'm a little confused by the の at the end. I thought の at the end of a sentence indicated a question, but that doesn't seem to be the case. What's の up to here
In English, "barely"/"hardly" can be used both with a connection to time ("just finished"):I had barely finished eating when he arrived. (食べたばかり...)or to express the idea that a goal was reached at great effort, sometimes against expectations:We barely made it alive.There was so much wind, I could barely move forward.I can hardly explain it myself.The former (time-related) can generally be translated well with words like ばかり/ばっかり. There are also a few expressions such as ギリギリ or やっとこ, that can express both shortness of time and "difficulty", but building them in the above sentences would be slightly unnatural.Beside these, is there a more idiomatic way to unambiguously translate that "can do with difficulty"/"nearly couldn't do it, but still managed" adverbial meaning in sentences like the ones above
It seems like this is a remnant of (or reference to) older forms of Japanese. Is that all there is to it, or does it have special meaning  Examples from songs:歌声　笑い声　満ちる大空　目指すは憧れ(DuDiDuWa*lalala - KOTOKO)吹きやまぬは残り風 [...]  巡りゆくはこの心(残り風 - いきものがかり)And lastly, the same with が:(At least I suspect that it's not the "but" kind of が. Feels like the subject particle for some reason.)巡り逢ったが　運の尽き(刀と鞘 - ALI PROJECT)
I decided to split this into a thread by itself because I was afraid of cramming too much into the first thread.Is it true that only movement verbs can take [V-stem]に to express a purposeWill it be possible for a non-movement verb to take [V-stem]に to express a purposeFor example (let's take a really wild example), could 遊びに食べる even imply something like "Eat. Reason: Play." / "Eat your vege, so that you can play."
I was taught that there is a grammatical form which goes like this: [V-stem]に行くFor example:　遊びに行く, which means "Go. Reason: to 遊ぶ"I was wondering does this grammatical form work for verbs whose stems are not stand-alone words by themselvesOk, in case this gets confusing..I mean 遊び is the stem of 遊ぶ, and 遊び is a standalone word in the dictionary which means "play (n)".選び is the stem of 選ぶ, but　選び is not a standalone word in the dictionary. 選び by itself means nothing.砕き is the stem of 砕く, 掘り of 掘る, 食べ of 食べる, 威張り of 威張る, 植え of 植える. but 砕き、掘り、食べ、威張り、植え by themselves are not standalone words in the dictionary. By themselves, they mean nothing.Does these work:砕きにいく。 "Go. Reason: to 砕く"掘りにいく。 "Go. Reason: to 掘る"食べにいく。 "Go. Reason: to 食べる"威張りにいく。 "Go. Reason: to 威張る"植えにいく。 "Go. Reason: to 植える"
Background, problem statementVery often, I find myself in situations where I have to build structurally complex sentences in Japanese, and find myself struggling, trying to put all I want to say in a single sentence.As far as the other languages I know well enough go, it's not an issue since they have relative pronouns that resolve many ambiguities (that, which, who, whose, qui, que, dont, auquel…),their grammar allow incremental stacking of relatives, starting with the base of the sentence (see example).I guess there are two viable solutions to my problem, but I never really paid attention to which was usually chosen in spoken (nor, in fact, written) Japanese.Solution 1, the most likelyBreak your sentence in many small chunks, make a sentence of each chunk, and convince yourself that unlike French or English, it's not awkward to have a train of sentences like "Aです。Bです。AとBの関係はCです。Dです。CとDの関係はEです…"Solution 2, the "wished" oneIt is possible to express unambiguously sentences likeOn Monday, the dog that ate the pudding that I cooked and whose owner's sister I met yesterday will be castrated.My attempt at this sentence would be like:月曜日には昨日妹さんにあった飼い主がいる私が作っていたケーキを食った犬が去勢手術を受ける。But even though I feel quite satisfied with this simple, quite linear one, I don't think it's likely to be heard…(FWIW, the sentences I build are often describing inter-related complex mathematical relations, which makes thing even harder…)The recent remark on "invertion" makes me wonder even more if this common to have such sentences, because inversion may cause ambiguities to arise:日本人の相手がいる人The person with a Japanese interlocutor The Japanese with an interlocutor相手の日本人がいる人 The partner with a Japanese person  The person with a Japanese partnerQuestionsDo you have issues expressing complex relations in JapaneseHow do you get round this issuesAre there relation patterns in English that you will definitely break into several Japanese sentencesDo you have trouble understanding the aforementioned kind of Japanese sentencesAnd subsidiary question, if ambiguity is definitely a major issue to all: how could the language not evolve to avoid ambiguities
If I wanted to describe the person I was speaking about as being Japanese, to me it seems natural to say:日本人{にほんじん}の相手{あいて}... however, one time a Japanese teacher told me it's more correct to say:相手{あいて}の日本人{にほんじん}... but that never sat right with me. To me the first way seems more logical because it goes from more general to more specific.Is 相手{あいて}の日本人{にほんじん} more correctIf so, why
Is it true that all nouns must be able to accept a が particle and a を particleI was curious about how we could form a sentence with:特別が特別を出色が出色を
I have been wondering about this, since every time I hand in a 作文 in a Japanese class, I'm corrected on conjunctions. It seems to me that whenever I use a てform as a conjunction, a response comes back that it has a cause-and-effect feel. I thought that it was just neutral, since there are so many different ways to express cause and effect, but it seems that might not actually be the case. That being said, I thought that stem forms and なく might be the actually neutral way to join two clauses. I just wanted to know if I'm correct.
I have been informed that よゆう is to do with temporal or physical room, while 余地 has to do with emotional room, but I might have misunderstood the explanation.
I realize that very likely the answer to this question is likely to be something along the lines of "that's just the way it is", but I thought it worth asking to see if there were some insights that weren't immediately apparent.In Tokyo, the JR train line called the  山手線【やまのてせん】 seems to have dropped the の from the way it is written. It seems there used to be areas of Tokyo referred to as 山の手 , which was where the elites lived and is in opposition to the term 下町【したまち】(downtown, lower class areas). I hear the 下町 often enough in reference to areas like Asakusa, but I haven't heard anyone use 山の手. The only やまのて I know of these days is the 山手 train line.There is also an area of town called [御茶ノ水]【おちゃのみず】, where the の is still there, but in katakana. Why not leave it in hiragana...So, is there any rhyme or reason to how these conventions of spelling came about Is there a relationOr are they just quirks of tradition that just stand on their own without any rhyme or reason
From Wikipedia:&amp;puncsp;–§–  貴様 — formerly an extremely honorific form of address; in modern speech is as insulting as, but more refined than, "temee"貴様 is often said (by textbooks) to be the most insulting word used refer to someone, even more insulting than 手前.Then, what does the article mean when it says that 貴様 is more refined than 手前Or is that information just plain wrong
I asked about this in the comments section of another question, but no one responded, so I guess I'll ask it here. The question involved expressing that someone was both a movie star and a politician, and various good alternatives were offered. It occurred to me that 兼 might work, so I checked example sentences in a dictionary, and found 「総理大臣兼外務大臣」. That seems similar enough. However, I was wondering, does 兼 work with two things as wildly disparate as "movie star", and "politician", or does it sound strange In other words, would one expect a stronger or more logical connection between the things that 兼 connects
A colleague is organizing an event and sent everyone an email beginning like this:田中イベント担当の田中です。イベントの前ふりをば。 ...　(explanation about the event)The first line is a funny intro (the guy is known for joking all the time)QUESTION: What does the イベントの前ふりをば part meanIs it another joke Does it convey any information
A book about architecture I'm trying to read (it's a bit of a slog what with the technical jargon and such) contained this description of a temple building: 二重、初重５X4間、裳階　（もこし）　つき、上重４X3間. So it's two stories, the first being five rooms by four, with lean-to rooms attached, etc. I have a few questions about this. First, how is the "X" in 5X4 read Additionally, I'm assuming that 初重 and 上重 are read しょじゅう　and じょうじゅう, respectively. Is this correct

tl;dr: when answering a negative question, can いいえ be used to affirm what the question  states as a wholeI came to Japan at the age of six, and I guess I pass as a normal native speaker of Japanese to most people (aside from some personal quirks like long response time).However, there's one thing, one very basic thing that I have a hard time getting right without a conscious effort: answering negative questions.Consider this negative question:車、持ってないんですか？ You don't have a carThe right way to answer is:いいえ、持ってます / いいえ。 Yes, I have one.はい、持ってません / はい。 No, I don't.The problem is, I almost always mix up はい/いいえ and end up answering just like in English. i.e. Describing my situation rather than responding to what the asker has in mind. With a single word answer, with no clarifying comment, it could be a life-or-death mistake. Over the years, despite the threat of death, I've developed a self-serving hypothesis that with most negative questions, the answer is predetermined and anticipated by context and it doesn't matter much if I screw up. This hypothesis seemed to work sometimes.My question is, can I keep on believing my hypothesis For example, if you were askedもう料理はいらない？Answering はい implies what the asker has in mind "She looks full" is true; your meal is over. (the correct answer in Japanese)Answering いいえ implies you're not in the mood for another dish, just like the asker thought; your meal is over. (according to my hypothesis)Or, is there no pathway for the kind of logic in #2 in the Japanese way of thinkingEdit 1: to clarify the scope of this question, a few bullet points if I may...Assume the question is a simple, plain negative questionthat is, no double negatives (...じゃないんじゃない), confirmation in the form of a question (...じゃないですよね), etc.answered with a single word (はい/いいえ/うん/ううん)taking place between true, pure-bred native Japanese speakersEdit 2: thanks to the feedbacks, I've come up with a definition of the problem in a more formal fashion. Here goes..Conversations take place amid tensions (or harmony) between several norms:Grammatical norm - the correct usage defined by grammar booksSocial norm - accepted, default usage in practiceContextual norm - accepted usage defined by contextThe question is, when answering a negative question with a single word, can contextual norm disagree with the grammatical one i.e. can an utterance of "いいえ" mean "はい" as defined in grammatical speak As of this writing, one answer says yes, two others say no.

Despite its being one of the most basic element of daily-life Japanese, I often find myself looking for a proper way to end certain phone conversations.Of course, I know the standard: [それでは]失礼します, or: よろしく[お願いします]...But somehow, neither of these seems quite right when ending a (somewhat formal) conversation where I am the customer (e.g. making a restaurant reservation). I often opt for a basic ありがとうございました, but I don't think it is a very idiomatic way to end such phone conversations.What would be a good phrase, beside the ones above, to end a phone conversation with a strangerUpdate: So from Tsyoshi's comments, it sounds like 失礼します is just the way to end all phone conversations, service people included. But Dave MG's はい、どうも provides a nice alternative (and he's the only answer), so I'll accept it.
すぐ, and especially 今すぐ, is my habitual way to express "soon", or "right after this".I know that じき means more or less the same thing, and when I hear it or see it written, I get the general meaning of the sentence.However, I don't feel comfortable saying it myself because I'm unclear on how they differ and what the nuances are.What are the conditions in which to choose one over the other, and do they differ in meaning
I was about to ask a question but I can't without first confirming,Is this sentence: 彼は映画スターであり、政治家もだ。grammatically correct, and mean:He is a movie star and also a politician.==Follow-up question here: Why does replacing だ to である changes the meaning of a the sentence
I have an issue with the word 立{た}つ, which is that I get it's basic meaning is "to stand", but I see it used in all sorts of ways that don't make sense to me.Here are some examples, from various native sources, where 立{た}つ throws me off:顔立{かおだ}ちが環境{かんきょう}に影響{えいきょう}し、性格{せいかく}が変{か}わるから。どうやら星{ほし}も音{おと}をたてるらしい。このジュースは時間{じかん}がたつと成分{せいぶん}が沈殿{ちんでん}します。My translations, flawed as they may be, are, respectively:"One's looks are influenced by the environment, because one's  disposition changes.""It's seems somehow like the stars are making noise.""After some time the pulp(ingredients) in this juice will settle."So, when I hear or read 立{た}つ, I basically get the drift, but...What is standing in terms of your face to change your looksNoise can stand If I had to say the second sentence, I would use 音{おと}をする.  I would never think of sound as "standing".Time standing I would think maybe time passes, as in 時間{じかん}を過{す}ごしす, but I would never think of time as standing.Either the Japanese language has a different concept of what it means "to stand", or 立{た}つ has a different meaning than I understand it (in addition to the meaning I do understand.)Can someone break down for me how these concepts are "standing" in these examples Hopefully so I can get some insight that will help me own and use 立{た}つ like Japanese people do. :)
My understanding of using わ at the end of a sentence is that it's essentially just for emphasis, just like using よ, and that only women can use it.However, as far as I know, women can, and often do, use よ as well.So is there a difference in meaning, nuance, or context which would make a woman choose to use わ instead of よ
My first thought is that いかない in this phrase conveys the meaning of 行かない, that is, not progressing to something. But this is mere guesswork. What is the history of いかない in ~わけにはいかない Does it have roots in the verb 行く or is this way off base
For over a decade of speaking (poorly) and listening to Japanese, it seems to me that I have almost exclusively heard the word えらい in the sense of meaning "admirable".For example, I'd mention volunteering in Tohoku, and someone might say えらいね to say "hey, good on you," or something like that. I swear this kind of use of えらい was the only one I was aware of for years.Then, recently, I'm reading Tintin and I come across this panel:Tintin: えらいときに　来あわせちゃった ([I] happened to arrive at a really bad time!)The context is that he's just arrived in a town where there is a war brewing between some local factions, and people are being conscripted for the army. Tintin fears getting forced into service. A bad time to show up indeed.That use of えらい didn't match my expectations, so I looked it up in a dictionary, and to my surprise, えらい does indeed mean "terrible", as well as "admirable" and "excellent".So... questions abound:Is this use of えらい rare or limited in some way so that the usage that I am familiar is the dominant use Or is it me who just happens to not have been exposed to the whole spectrum of meaningsIt seems from the dictionary that when used in the positive light there are two kanji, 偉い and 豪い. I'm guessing the second kanji is more rare, but is there a difference in use or meaningLastly, if the sentence 「えらいときに来あわせちゃった」 were taken out of context and presented completely on its own, is there any way of knowing whether the positive or negative meaning of えらい was intended

It seems common enough for Japanese to attempt to use English, that we get some truly bizarre translations. Especially bad are older games that were non-professionally translated to what we came to call "Engrish", due to what could have been a misspelling of the very name for our language. I don't imagine this happens, or happened, very often in the reverse direction. Is there a word in Japanese for Japanese text that has been poorly translated from English (or any language)In particular, imagine a game that has perfectly normal Japanese, but you can choose the language, and the language list has "English" spelt "Engrish", giving you an early warning sign that this could be really bad (and possibly also really awesome, but not intentionally). I'm looking for the opposite mistake, where it's the Japanese that's poor, if it exists and can be understood in the same way.
I learned from a Japanese friend that ふむふむ could be translated like "oh, I got it", "I see", "I know", or "ok". It could be also in this form: ふむふむ　なるほどBut, my sister lived in Japan for 5 years, and she had never heard of it.Is it still used
One day, I asked my japanese friend how I could invite some friends to eat.He said "一緒に食べに行くかい？"I know that we could also say:   行きましょうか（行こうか）？行きませんか（行かない）？行きますか（行くの）？  but I got interested in why he used "kai".I'd like to know others situations that japanese people use "kai"

The passage suggests that not all na-type adjectives can be used as real nouns as shown in (b). It doesn't seem to be a case of careless choice of words, since in the 2nd para, the passage uses "some" and in the 3rd para, the passage uses "all", and there is an explicit contrast.I was wondering why is it that not all na-type adjectives can be used as real nouns. As far as I know, all na-type adjectives can be used as if they are real nouns, like for example, this is grammatical right:特有は確かだIs there even 1 na-type adjective that can't be used as a real noun as shown in (b) (to prove that passage right)
I saw on a board the other day someone referring to insecticide as "薬", which doesn't really fit with the English conception of "medicine". I looked up "薬" in Kenkyuusha, and sure enough, "chemical" was listed as a meaning (along with "enamel", which is just weird if you ask me, but anyway . . .).My question is, how broadly does the "chemical" sense apply in normal usage For example, would an adhesive,a cleanser, or a solvent be classed as "薬" Additionally, are there other senses which might surprise an English speaker

How did the の get in the expression 「◯◯のバカ!」 Was the expression originally longer Is there any other example of usage other than insults(other example I know of: 「つよし君のエッチ!」 or anything to the same effect) Edit: Another example by Pacerier: 「Tsunadeのばあさん」. Seeing that バカ is also a noun, that would make them similar grammatically.Edit 2: Or maybe not. I think what I hear in old-fashioned candy stores are surnames, not first names, e.g. 高橋のばあさん, whereas it would mean "the grandma of Takahashi household (whose store sells candies)". I don't know if Tsunade is a surname or not though.I did a quick search and miraculously, one BBS that is discussing construct uses the exact same sentence 「お父さんのバカ！」: http://mentai.hanako.2ch.net/gengo/kako/981/981698334.html
A book I've read states that けど is a 接続詞 (conjunction).However, another book I had read states that it is a 助詞 (particle).Who is right
他 is one of these common words that still to this day confuses me...My general assumption is that:used as a prefix, it should always be read 【た】, e.g.: 他人【たにん】when treated as a "substantive" (that is essentially, followed by の), it is 【ほか】: 他【ほか】の人【ひと】()But then, some expressions crop up, like 他の物, which my dictionary indicates as read 【たのもの】, and make me doubt whatever little I have deduced so far.Could anybody settle the た/ほか rules once and for all (and point out any nuance in meaning, if they exist, between the two usages)
I was taught that these two phrases are interchangeable and have the same meaning.However, I recently wrote a few practice sentences using this grammar point and they were corrected to use ずには instead of ないではThe sentences I wrote were:知り合いにそっくりだったので、話しかけないではいられなかった。  まだ子供なので、許さないではいられなかった。However, both of these were corrected to:知り合いにそっくりだったので、話しかけずにはいられなかった。  まだ子供なので、許さずにはいられなかった。I was under the impression that both were acceptable and can't find anything stating otherwise. Is there something in particular with these sentences that they can only use ずには？ Or am I completely missing something

WWWJDIC lists いちにん and ににん as alternative readings of 一人 {ひとり} and 二人 {ふたり}, but I can't recall anywhere I heard those readings except when counting more than 10 people for example 三十一人 {さんじゅういちにん}. Is that the only situation where 一人 and 二人 are read as いちにん and ににん, or are there any other situations
The example sentences in WWWJDIC all use the word "首" in the "fire" sense (e.g. 彼を首にしてやる) hence I was wondering is the term only used to refer to "firing" someone Or is it also used to refer to students who have just graduated and not yet found a job (they have never had a job before so they can't be fired can they)

A friend once commented to me that Japanese has a larger vocabulary than English. I said I didn't think it did, because it wasn't really accurate to call all kanji compounds "words". My friend said I was crazy.Words like 新車【しんしゃ】(new car) and 愛車【あいしゃ】(one's own car / "beloved" car) are in the dictionary, but... aren't they really just the application of prefixes to the word "car"Put another way, in English I wouldn't consider "neopragmatism" it's own word, it's just the addition of the prefix "neo" to the word "pragmatism". (I don't even know if it's in the dictionary or not and won't look it up, because my point is that as a native/fluent English speaker, I can stick 'em together if I want, dictionary be damned!) Aren't some kanji compounds the same kind of thing... not really words, but just obvious in meaning when combined correctlyPut yet another way, if one were trying to learn Japanese vocabulary, it would be ridiculous to have a list that included all the possible kanji combinations that get used in the real world. It's more efficient to learn a concept like 新 as a prefix and you instantly have potential understanding of many kanji compounds - 新語【しんご】(new word), 新貨【しんか】(new currency), 新地【しんち】(new territory), etc...So, is any valid kanji compound really considered its own word in some kind of official or commonly understood sense, or are some kanji compounds considered merely "combinations"If I combine kanji in some new and useful way, have I invented a new word, or am I merely using the kanji in the Lego-like combinative way they're intended to be usedAnother way I might ask is, do Japanese consider "words" and "combinations" as separate things
My understanding of the word 音沙汰【おとさた】(news, letter) is that in terms of usage, it functions the same way that 連絡【れんらく】(contact, communication) does. It refers to modes of communication between people.The context in which I read it was a book, written recently, where the author spoke about communication from a girlfriend at that time. The author seemed to deliberately choose 音沙汰 over 連絡 to convey a different feeling of how communication was in the sixties, when the relationship happened.So you could say:音沙汰がなかったor...連絡がなかった... and they would have the same essential meaning, but the former says, "there was no contact by phone or letter," and the latter says "there was no contact by phone, letter, email, text, etc..."So my question is, does 音沙汰 mean communication in a sense of writing letters and making phone calls, and therefor has a 昭和【しょうわ】 era (or earlier) feel to itAnd has 音沙汰 been more or less entirely replaced in modern Japanese by 連絡 because now we use email and text messaging and a wider variety of more immediate communication technologiesOr am I just totally off base about the meaning and usage of 音沙汰

This is a follow-up question to Does うるさい have a "negative" connotation.I've seen うるさい written as 五月蝿い.現代では、is this form used often / at allWhat does this have to do with flies (蝿【はえ】) in May  Do a lot of flies hatch in May due to excessive trash built up from Golden week  Or is there a lot of poop outside for some reason that attracts them  Or dead carcassesIs it at all related to 蝉【セミ】 and May is when they start to come out for the summer, and the [蝉時雨]{セミしぐれ} is unbearably noisy
Is it true that when someone uses the word うるさい,  it means that there is a feeling of "discontent" Like for example, we will take this sentence: "It will be noisy in the factory" "It will be noisy in the factory"  is neutral. (no nuance of annoyance )But is it true that if we translate that sentence into japanese using うるさい as a replacement for noisy, immediately we will have the nuance that the speaker is "annoyed" at the noisyness
While hiking I saw 3 bears, and I have heard a lot of people say ひき to count them. There was a mother and two small ones, if that matters.But when talking about it I also have been told that 頭 should be used to count bears.Are both usable Does it depend on the age of the bear
Initially I'd thought ひき is for small animals and 頭 is for animals that are not small ("big" animals) however EDICT (http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/cgi-bin/wwwjdic.cgi1MUE%E3%81%B2%E3%81%8D) seems to claim that horses belong to the ひき group and not the 頭 group (yet of course I think we can agree that a horse is not "small" at all!).1) Basically I was wondering is it true that "horses" is the exception where we ignore the "small" / "big" rule and they are always counted with ひき (regardless of the size of the horse) instead of 頭 2) Are there any cases when ひき is used to refer to a non-small animal
A certain dialog in my book has a man describing the symptoms of his cold to the doctor.  It reads thus:医者：熱はありますか。  患者：はい、きのうから。夕べはぞくぞく寒気がしたので、高熱が出るんじゃないかとひやひやしたんですが、今のところ７度８分【なな・ど・はち・ぶ】くらいでおさまっています。The English translation on the next page read, "Doctor:  Do you have a fever  Man:  Yes, I do, since yesterday.  Last night I came down with the chills and started shivering, and I was afraid I'd get a really high fever.  Now it's only about 37.8°C though."My question is, was the original Japanese sentence a typo and should have said 37度８分 instead of just ７度８分, or do Japanese people commonly just refer to body temperatures by the number of degrees over 30  Although if it's the latter, how would you refer to a body temperature of 40 or more (for argument's sake; ignoring the fact that you'd probably be dead)
WWWJDIC does not tally their meanings of 掛ける and 掛かる so i find it hard for a beginner like me to properly learn these 2 words..Do all these meanings of 掛ける and 掛かる tally: (is this list correct):1a) to hang 地図を掛ける1b) to be hung 地図が掛かる2a) to take (time/money) 時間を掛ける2b) to be taken.. 時間が掛かる3a) to multiply ２と３を掛ける3b) to be multiplied２と３が掛かる4a) to wear (glasses/necklace) ネックレスを掛ける4b) to be worn.. ネックレスが掛かる5a) to make a call 電話を掛ける5b) to be made.. 電話が掛かる6a) to make an insurance 保険を掛ける6b) to be made.. 保険が掛かる7a) to set (engine/alarm) into "on" mode テープレコーダを掛ける7b) to be set.. テープレコーダが掛かる8a) to fix (toothache/headache) 頭痛を掛ける8b) to be fixed.. 頭痛が掛かる9a) to lock 鍵を掛ける9b) to be locked.. 鍵が掛かる10a) to secure (seatbelt) シートベルトを掛ける10b) to be secured.. シートベルトが掛かる11a) to apply (salt/toppings) 塩を掛ける11b) to be applied.. 塩が掛かる12a) to spread over/around (cloth/dust/tape) テープを掛ける12b) to be spread.. テープが掛かる13a) to cast (spell) 魔法を掛ける13b) to be cast.. 魔法が掛かる14a) to trick (someone) トムを掛ける14b) to be tricked.. トムが掛かる15a) to have a feeling (pity/hope) 情けを掛ける15b) to be felt.. 情けが掛かる16a) to present (someone to court / idea to conference) 質問を掛ける16b) to be presented.. 質問が掛かるIs it true that the only meaning that is not available in both 掛かる and 掛ける, is:to depend on (someone/something) 我々が彼の手伝いに掛かるPS: if some of the example phrases are wrong please correct me thx!PS: i think i will leave out "standard phrases" out of the discussion, like: 腰を掛ける, 迷惑を掛ける, お目に掛かる
This is a frequent problem that I think many Japanese learners experience. You look at some Japanese sentences, and you understand the words, and most, if not all, the grammar, and yet still, it just doesn't seem to mean anything.That is the case when I look at this ad that I recently saw on the subway:The text says:本当のガキ大将は、弱い者いじめなんて絶対にしなかった。昔話でもしながら、ま、一杯。In kana:ほんとうの　がきたいしょうは、　よわいもの　いじめなんて　ぜったいに　しなかった。むかしばなしでも　しながら、　ま、　いっぱい。And my rough translation:The leader of the gang never bullied the weak ones.While talking about old time, hey, have a glass.がき means more like "punk", but in this case since it's plural, I opted for "gang". 一杯 means a full cup, but I went with "glass" as in "have a glass of beer".The second sentence, that one should enjoy a beer while talking over the old times seems clear enough.But... the leader of the bullies didn't pick on the weak Am I reading that right And if so... It's a weird assertion. Isn't the leader of the bullies by default complicit in bullying The picture adds to my confusion I think the kid on the far left is the leader of the bullies, the kid with the broken net is the victim, and the rest are the gang. It looks like the leader is the one who broke the net... It seems to contradict what the words say.What the heck is going on Does it mean what I think it means and I'm not getting some cultural aspect in order to understand it Or does it not mean what I think it means
Note: I understand the risk that this question might be considered "too localized". However, my hope in asking isn't just to translate this one instance, but to use it as an exploration of how and why standard Japanese words can get modified by a native speaker so as to deviate so far from the textbook that they become unparsable to a learner.One thing I find somewhat frustrating about my level of Japanese is that my ability to understand people rapidly drops off the more they add character to what they say.So, for example, I can't understand the crazy rantings of a man who, for some reason, is walking down the street shouting at the top of his lungs.Which is what I encountered today when walking through Aoyama Ichome. The guy, who didn't look particularly crazy, was walking along, shouting at the top of his lungs to no one in particular.It frustrated me that I couldn't understand him. He rolled his Rs too much, shortened his words, and possibly used slang I didn't get. At one point (not in the recording), I made out the words 娘【むすめ】(daughter), and ですか. That was it, though.I followed behind him for a bit and recorded him using Soundcloud, which you can listen to here. The sound quality is better than I expected, but still a little quiet.However, I know that in English I would be able to cut through the noise and make out what he says. In Japanese, I can't parse his words.Can anyone make out what he is saying, and in addition offer some analysis of the types of modifications that make his words so hard to parse

Is it true that when we see 伯母 it usually (90%) means "parent's elder sister" and sometimes (10%) can be used to refer to the parent's younger sisterOn the contrary, when we see 叔母 does it always (100%) mean "parent's younger sister" and never "parent's elder sister"
My Japanese text book says that a present-tense verb followed by ことにする is used to indicate making a decision about the action. But I've also noticed the verb 決める, and that it's usage is very similar.So supposing we have a sentence such as:朝ご飯を作った後に、ジョギングすることにした。(After making breakfast, I decided to jog.) My question is, would there be any specific semantic difference if 決める was used In all the cases that I've seen, the final する has always been in the past-tense, but 決める has been in a variety of forms; is this possible difference of the twoThanks! :)
Ok, so there seems to be some controversy over whether we can really say that there are 'の-adjectives', or whether we simply use a noun in an "attributive" way (a term which I don't actually really understand). But it's clear that there's something interesting going on here, a deviation from the "default" understanding of の (as marking the genitive case), and I'd like some clarification.Let's look at what seems to be for whatever the classical example:○　「永遠の愛」 "eternal love"It's clear that we can't just apply the pattern "X の Y ⇔ Y of X" here*. But what is really going on How do we know that the usual pattern doesn't apply here - is it contextual A matter of set-phrasing Is it because 永遠, being abstract, would need to be reified to be used in the normal way* It's worth noting that the pattern doesn't even hold in English here, which does seem to be a special case."love of eternity" - a strange thing to talk about, but in English, reification is implicit so this works just as well as "love of gold". But what is more strange is that with "love" in particular, this doesn't have the normal genitive-case meaning - an English speaker parses "love of gold" not as the love which is expressed by gold, but love such that gold is the thing that is loved. Similarly for "eternity", following the same role.And it doesn't even work the same way with similar words... * "desire/lust of gold" - should be "desire/lust for gold". But regardless, a love which is eternal is not the same thing as a love which is expressed by (belongs to, really; but in what other sense can love be possessed than by expressing it) eternity-seen-as-an-entity, which would be the default interpretation of the pattern.What happens in Japanese with that example 「金の愛」 - grammatical How would it be interpreted How about with explicit reification (「金のことの愛」・「金のものの愛」）？And how literal is it to translate 「永遠の」 as "eternal" Can we describe what's going on here more pedantically What determines our ability to use a noun this way with のAnd am I getting too philosophical :)
Do Japanese writers use underline to emphasize a point, or other techniques Wikipedia mentions the use of katakana in its article on Emphasis and in its article on Katakana, but I'm not sure whether it's appropriate.Background: I’m incorporating XKCD 386 (with the text modified) into a talk given in English with Japanese subtitles. I'm doing the cartoons side by side, and I'm wondering what the equivalent of underlining "wrong" in a western cartoon would be.
These three phrases can be used to express emotions and feelings that cannot be controlled.For example in the following sentences:a) １点差で負けたので、悔しくてならない。b) １点差で負けたので、悔しくてしょうがない。c) １点差で負けたので、悔しくてたまらない。With this,1) How do the above sentences differ Are they all interchangeable Are any "stronger" than the others (To me てたまらない seems particularly strong due to たまらない meaning "unbearable".)2) If we were to literally translate the above sentences would they be something along the lines of:a) I lost by one point, it's so frustrating it just can't be.b) I lost by one point, it's so frustrating there is nothing I can do.c) I lost by one point, it's so frustrating it's unbearable.Note: I understand the てならない and てしょうがない have an additional function when used with verbs which can mean "can't help but", as in この写真を見ると、子供の頃のことが思い出されてならない／しょうがいない。However, for the scope of this question, I think we should keep it to the meaning of "unbearably" or "so ~".

In the song "Eien no tobira" (永遠の扉) by Yonekura Chihiro (米倉千尋) the chorus starts with this line:言葉じゃなくて約束もなくてSince じゃなくて is contraction of ではなくて, I would have expected the second clause to say でもなくて, but it became もなくて with the で omitted instead. There is possibility that the lyric writer really wanted to say "there is no my promise either" instead of "it is not my promise either" but that would make it not parallel to the the first clause "it is not my word" (sorry I can't find a better translation for 言葉 in this context).Assuming if the lyric line's second clause was supposed to say 「約束でもなくて」, is it okay to omit the で particle and yet still retain the intended meaning through parallel structure with the first clause In the context of a song or literature, does this kind of trick workN.B. It is a really nice song. I recommend trying listening to it if you haven't :)
In a recent comment exchange on ELU.SE, a Japanese man (my senior in years, and a "guest" in the forum whose questions I had answered regularly for some time, but not much lately as I have been scaling back my participation there), said in his comment to my response:お久しぶりです。I felt obliged to respond in kind withご無沙汰いたしました。and that is how I replied.

See title. I'm looking for idiomatic ways to say something like this - over-emphasizing something, worrying about it overly much, etc.Bonus points if a literal 大 (whether read as だい　or おお) is involved; I'm hoping to make a particular bit of wordplay work. Alternatively, perhaps a way of talking about "using 大 as a prefix to a word" that could have the former connotations
I learned that you can use でも (demo) at the beginning of a sentence to mean "but," and that you can use けど (kedo) at the end of a sentence to mean "though." However, I don't see a difference between these two.For example, suppose someone says this: あした かいもの に いきましょう. Ashita kaimono ni ikimashō. "Let's go shopping tomorrow." Would there be any difference in these two responsesでも あした は やすみ です. Demo ashita wa yasumi desu. "But tomorrow is a holiday."あした は やすみ です けど. Ashita wa yasumi desu kedo. "Tomorrow is a holiday though."To me, these two responses seem to have the exact same meaning. So my question is this: Are there are any differences between でも (demo) and けど (kedo) It seems like the placement of the "but" (でも at the beginning and けど at the end) could change the emphasis. Is that true If so, howAlso, are there any situations when you can use one but not the other
I found a page in Japanese with title "世界でもっとも汚染された10の都市". Having encountered the phrase 「もっとも」 for the first time, I looked it up on WWWJDIC and found two entries:尤も 【もっとも】 (adj-na,adv,conj,n) quite right; plausible; natural; but then; although;最も 【もっとも】 (adv) most; extremely;Since the page is about world's dirtiest cities, I assumed that the もっとも used in the page title is the second one 最も that means "most, extremely". However, should I have not known what the page is about, I think I would have not known which of the two もっとも is the one used in the title since both of them can be used an adverb. Since WWWJDIC example sentence for 尤も is using it as a noun, I tried to look for sample sentences that use 尤も as an adverb with not much luck.Are there scenarios where 尤も is commonly used as an adverb If it's rare, is it safe to assume that if もっとも is used as an adverb in a sentence, it is most probably 最も, otherwise if it's not used as an adverb it is most probably 尤も
Verb る-form + そう indicates hearsay.帰るそうだ  'I hear he will go home.'   帰らないそうだ [Negative]Verb masu stem (i.e. conjunctive form 連用形) + そう shows information obtained through the senses, observation:帰りそうだ  'It looks like he will go home.'   帰らなさそう [Negative]With this, how do you achieve past tenseFor "hearsay", do you say: 帰ったそうだ  ' I heard he went home.'Whilst for "observation", do you say:帰りそうだった   'It looked like he went home.'
I translate these words as either "only, just, simply".I'd like to know how I could differentiate these 4 ways (i.e., when I use that one, and when I use the other).Examples:たったひとつの恋　(Dorama)  ただの子供だ  ただ待つだけだ  よし, この 10 万円は君にあげよう. ただし, これ以上はお断わりだよ.  ...  ... so on

I am familiar with the set phrase 「言われてみれば」 as a way to say "Now that you say that", but as I examine the phrase further, the phrase structure strikes me as strange. The 〜てみる conjugation is commonly used to say "to try doing something", but what meaning does it give when used with passive verb form; "to try being done" does not make much sense to me.Maybe one might argue that 「言われてみれば」 is a set phrase so I should just accept it as such, but when I googled around I found that while many verbs yielded zero results when I tried to find their [passive]てみれば forms, there are some verbs, mostly related to speech, that can use this form:本当に好きだったと聞かれてみれば、本当に愛してたと答えられる。  違う病院に行く、ご事情を話されてみれば良いと思います。But there are also some verbs that are not related to speech:愛されて壊されてみれば (song lyric)お前が轢かれてみれば分かるから、お前で実験してみろよ。So, in general what meaning does this form give to the original verbs, and in what kinds of scenarios is it used for
This recent question introduced me to the concepts of 外来語【がいらいご】, defined as foreign words not originating from Chinese, and 和製英語【わせいえいご】, which are English constructions that were made in Japan.According to the above links, the word レンジ is considered a 外来語 because it is derived from the English word "range", which is an old-fashioned way of talking about a stove.What happens when a 外来語 is combined with another word to form a compound wordFor example, ガスレンジ is a gas stove, not a "gas range" in English.  Is this an example of 和製英語電子レンジ combines a 外来語 with a kanji-compound.  Is this still considered 外来語  Or, is there some other classification for words like this

The following sentence is from a newspaper article メレンゲ菓子は数あれど、これほど繊細なものは珍しい。あれど　＝　あるけど makes sense to me in the context, and this seems to be supported by my searches so far - is it simply a written formThe full phrase "は数あれど" appears extremely common on google - is 数 here read しばしば, and is this a set phrase
In a professional setting, would two professors/doctors/lawyers—who would normally be addressed as "sensei"—refer to each other (as peers) using "sensei"Note: This question used to be asking about Japanese formality in English.  Now I'm just interested on how sensei would be used in this context in spoken Japanese.
Putting な after a plain verb turns it into negative imperative.But I noticed that in spoken Japanese, putting な after conjunctive form (連用形) turns it into positive imperative. For example:遊びに行きなよ。Is this usage standard or colloquial Also, it seems that it's usually used by elders towards younger people so does it have special nuances, for example maybe like patronizing
An entry of Tae Kim's blog suggested that 出来る came from Chinese word 出来 that does have the nuance of potentiality, but the most recent visitor's comment claimed that the usage of 出来 in Chinese to show potentiality is fairly recent, so the usage of 出来る in Japanese might be unrelated to the Chinese word after all.If this Japanese verb really did not come from the Chinese, how do the kanji characters for "to go out" and "to come" end up giving the nuance of potentiality in JapaneseCan anyone find out authoritative sources on the actual etymology of 出来るEDIT: Also, is the origin of 出来る somehow related to 出来 {しゅったい} (meaning: occurrence) or 出来 {でき} (meaning: workmanship, execution etc)
Initially I wanted to compare the rudeness level of [v]ないでくれ。 and[v]な。 but since that may be a rather vague question:In what situation is it appropriate to use [v]ないでくれ。 but not [v]な。 In what situation is it appropriate to use [v]な。 but not [v]ないでくれ。 I mean I'm not asking for a list of examples when it is appropriate to use 1) or 2), but rather one example on when it is appropriate to use  [v]ないでくれ。 but not [v]な。 and explanation on why it is so, and another example on when it is appropriate to use [v]な。 but not [v]ないでくれ。 + explanation.PS: as for the くれ i'm referring to the short / abrupt / manly くれ and not the くれ in 勘弁してくれよ~
Is it true that only girls will use うち to refer to themselvesSo  when a guy say うち he is referring to his in-group / company / family, and not referring to himself, right
焼き鳥屋さんで集まったのですが、とても楽しい、かつ有意義な時間を過ごしました。
Is wasei-eigo or wasei-kango looked down upon by Japanese language purists (as opposed to English or Chinese purists!) as informal, inauthentic, incorrect or the like
I came across the phrase 言ったりしたら【いったりしたら】 in one of the Tintin books I'm reading. It means something like "if I say [it]".What I can't figure out is how it's different from simply saying 言ったら.Here it is in context:My rough translation:Tintin: So, what is that boss's nameDoctor: I... I can't say that! If I say it, they'll do something terrible to me!What is the difference in nuance or meaning between 言ったりしたら and 言ったら
Of course 来る is most often read as くる.  However, it can also be read as きたる.  Is きたる mostly an archaic reading  Does it carry a different, or any additional meanings  When are "appropriate" (socially, grammatically, etc.) times to use it
Way back in the day when I was first learning Japanese, I learned that you could add ことができる to a verb to indicate potential. Like so:食{た}べることができる(I) can eat (something)It became my habitual way of expressing possibilities.Then later, I learned that you could just modify the verb and get the same thing:食{た}べられる(I) can eat (something)I know that this is also the passive voice, but, unless I'm mistaken, it can be used strictly as a way of expressing potential.I still tend to habitually say ことができる, though. It tends to jump out of my mouth before I realize that I could have probably modified the verb. I think because my brain thinks they are the same thing, so I just go with the usual.So... are they different
I'm a little confused on the difference between [凍る]{こおる} and [凍える]{こごえる}.From what I've researched, it seems like 凍る focuses more on the physical process of something freezing, and the result being ice or frozen solid.  Like water freezing into ice, or a steak freezing and becoming solid after it's been in the freezer for a while.Whereas 凍える seems to be the more abstract concept of freezing, or the physical sensation of freezing.  Like freezing toes/fingers when you're walking outside in the winter, or a "frozen wasteland".Is this correct thinking, or am I off
I agree that ～たら is one practical tool that could express lots of meanings. but sometimes it became one problem for students of japanese.  If I say:日本に行ったら、友達を訪ねます。it's : If I go to Japan, I will visit my friend.()or: When I get to Japan, I will visit my friend.()卒業したら、旅行したいと思います。it's : If I graduate (it's a possibility), I want to travel.or: After graduating (it's certain), I'm think of traveling..Does the meaning depend on the context or Is there a better way to say that sentences
Japanese以下の文を比較すると、でき得るならば、独立して事業を始めたい。できれば、独立して事業を始めたい。意味が同じですか？どう違いますか？すみませんが、説明して頂けませんか？EnglishIf we compare the following two sentences:でき得るならば、独立して事業を始めたい。できれば、独立して事業を始めたい。Is the meaning the same How do they differ Could someone explain it
I learnt:食べるところ：about to eat.食べているところ：in the middle of eating.食べたところ：just ate.食べたばかり：just ate.I would like to know if I can change ところ　for とこ in spoken language.and if there is any difference between 食べたところ and 食べたばかり. which one is more rude, or more polite; and if I can use both in any situation.
According to jisho.org they have the same meaning. How to know which to use
I found quite a few website tables and software conversors, but none that was both complete and authoritative.  Is there any place I can find such a list in digital format拡張新字体 would be a nice bonus, but what I’m really interested is the official list.
I've been meaning to ask this for a while.What is the difference between these 3 words. I was taught they all mean "why", but obviously, being different words they convey different nuance and would be used in different situations.What would be the difference between these 3 sentences and in what situations would they be used  なぜここにいるのですか？どうしてここにいるのですか？なんでここにいるのですか？
I'm wondering whether it makes sense to say [v]ませんでしたら instead of [v]なかったら.When I googled for that conjugation there were very few results, but since there were results, I wonder if people actually use [v]ませんでしたら.For example http://homepage3.nifty.com/floatingbugs/fishing070216.htm:お名前を聞きませんでしたらまた。。http://detail.chiebukuro.yahoo.co.jp/qa/question_detail/q1150782366　二回目は私達は帰りに焼肉を食べたので食べませんでしたら以後作らなくなりました。http://blog.zaq.ne.jp/lemongrass/article/707/いつまでもアップしませんでしたら、失敗したんやなって思っといてください。
Consider these two sentences:　(1) 母はついてくるようにアリスに合図した (Mother signaled to Alice to follow her)　(2) 父は手で私に部屋を出ていくようにと合図した。 (Father gestured to me to go out of the room)And another sentence which I suspect has the same use of と　as (2) but I cannot exactly say what it does:(3) この本は子供を対象とした本です。(Unnatural: This book is a book that is done in order for children to be targets) (Natural: This is a book for children)Now I deconstruct the use of AをBとC in (3) to mean "Do verb C to achieve state B in direct object A"(Question) How would I understand the use of と in (2) Since (1) does not require と yet has a similar structure involving ように. But XようにY means "to do Y so that X can happen". What happens when と is added to the mix as in (2)(Example sentences taken from WWWJDIC)
There are several adjectives that are formed by attaching 「手」 to more common adjectives:手厳しい手堅い手早い手広い手短いBut most of the time this does not seem to change the meaning of the adjective very much.厳しい severe; strict; rigid手厳しい severe; harsh堅い hard; solid手堅い steady; firm早い fast; quick手早い nimble; quick; agile広い spacious; vast手広い spacious; roomy短い short手短い short; briefCan these adjectives be used interchangeably  What does the 手 prefix mean, and how does it change the meaning of the adjective
Consider this phrase:　今は(event)二十分前です。Deconstruction of the above phrase yields:Now is twenty minutes before (event).(Q1) Can I reconstruct the statement using 後 in this manner:　今は後で(event)に二十分がある。(I'm not sure if I used に correctly here)(There are twenty minutes from now to (event)).(Q2) Can 今は and (event) be elided once the context is set That is to say 二十分前です and 後二十分がある are acceptable phrasesI think that (event) cannot be elided to form 二十分前です and yet retain the meaning. By itself the phrase would mean "(it was) twenty minutes ago" and would be too vague to be useful to specify (event) in relation to "now".
I can't find this in any dictionary, but it seems to mean something like picture. Is that rightI don't have an example sentence, because that word was the whole sentence.
What nuance does "ことなく" haveIf we compare the following two sentences:(For example, at a footrace:)最後まで、あきらめないで走ります！vs最後まで、あきらめることなく、走ります！Is ことなく stronger than simply saying ないで Does ことなく show will and volition more than the ないで version
I'm unsure of the difference between these four words. They all seem to indicate some type of "condition" or "circumstances".(1) Are they interchangeable(2) What are some example sentences which show their differences.
1) What is the difference between 言うな！ and  言ってんじゃねぇぞ!, in other words can we use them interchangeably at all times2) which is ruder
I see 対応（たいおう） quite often, but I can't seem to grasp exactly what this word means or how to use it properly.Checking a dictionary I get about 5 different definitions, all quite different from one another.My question is, what does this word actually mean and what are the most common ways it is used Are there any good example sentences which show the usage of this word clearly
I am wondering what the reading and meaning of 公け is in the following sentence:彼女のことが公けになることを好まず、ひそかに離縁しようと決心した。
I noticed that verb ending syllables cover all of -u syllables (る,く,ぐ,す,つ etc) except ず,づ, ふ, ぷ, しゅう, ちゅう and じゅう. I suspect that ず is reserved for the negative conjugation thus no plain form verb is allowed. しゅう, ちゅう and じゅう were mostly reserved for on-yomi pronunciation, I think, so no verbs for them either.Not sure about づ.ふ and ぷ is a curious case because there are verbs that end with ぶ but not the other two.I'm not saying that there should always be verbs that cover each of the -u syllables but I'm just curious why there are no verbs that end with some of them. Maybe there are some historical reasons behind the gap
i was taught that verbs are either transitive or intransitive.but what kind of verb is 分かる WWWJDIC lists it as intransitive.Yet the replies/comments from this thread Why is it 日本語がわかります instead of 日本語をわかります argues that を can be used with 分かる.so is　分かる both a transitive verb and an intransitive verb at the same time
What's the difference between 言わないでほしい and 言ってほしくない If the intended message is "I don't want you to say it" which of the two above would be more suitable
I always know that 歩く is the verb to use when talking about walking. But I'm aware the kanji 歩 has another verb 歩む. In WWWJDIC, the example sentence given is:ビルはあの会社の社長になるまで成功への道を歩み続けた。  Bill climbed the ladder of success until he became the president of the company.There is also this one line from the lyrics of the song 「未来へ」 by KIRORO:これがあなたの歩む道。It seems to me from these usage examples that 歩む is better suited to refer to the abstract type of walking, like walking down the path of life, while 歩く is used when referring to the actual act of walking on foot. Is this always true
WWWJDIC states that 「だらしない」 can be written with kanji as 「だらし無い」, which suggests that the phrase is a negative construction that uses 「無い」, unlike words like 「すくない」 and 「あぶない」. Furthermore, 「だらしが無い」 and 「だらしの無い」 are listed as the other two variants of the phrase, which imply that the phrase is using 「だらし」 as a noun, instead of being derived from the negative of non-existent verb 「だらしる」. However there is no dictionary entry on 「だらし」 other than as "dalasi", the currency of the country of Gambia, and "だらしない" variants.So, what exactly is 「だらし」 Or was there a verb 「だらしる」 which is now extinct
My friend recently said to me:眠くなってきた　【ねむくなってきた】Which, I think means "I became sleepy".But it seems to me that it is the same as saying:眠くなったHow does the addition of きた change this phrase
Explain the differences in the following vocabulary.  They all essentially mean some form of investigation, inspection, etc.  Please don't just write the definitions; I'm lost on how they differ, when to use one over others, what they apply to, and so on.  After much study, a lot of them still seem to overlap in my mind (and maybe they do).  Here they are.  Good luck!監査【かんさ】鑑査【かんさ】検査【けんさ】検討【けんとう】審査【しんさ】捜査【そうさ】探査【たんさ】調査【ちょうさ】査察【ささつ】視察【しさつ】監察【かんさつ】
Both 間 {あいだ} and 内 {うち} can be used to describe time span relative to specific situations, similar to "while" in English. But are they interchangeable all the time Are there any scenarios where one can use one of them but not the other Are there differences in nuancesExample sentences of my own (I'm not sure if they are correct or not so if they sound wrong please point out why):先生が見てない間に逃げよう先生が見てない内に逃げよう
(Question 1)Are there any differences in nuance and usage of conjunctive form of verb (連用形) + をする compared to the plain form of those verbs whose conjunctive forms can be used as nounsFor example:間違える vs 間違えをする考える vs 考えをする逃げる vs 逃げをする(Question 2)Does (連用形) + をする follow the plain form in term of transitive or intransitive E.g 逃げる is intransitive; is 逃げをする intransitive too
I came across the sentence 混乱する気持ちもよーくわかる in my manga. I have translated it, but the use of the dash (which was vertical in the actual vertical text) stumped me for a bit (I thought it was よう at first, not よお). I was under the impression that a dash like that is only used in katakana, and in hirigana they use the character of the sound they want to extend. But that's not the case here.So what does it mean when this happens Is is a special case or exception, or is there some ruleBy the way, I ended up with よーくわかる all together meaning "I know you..." (thanks, Google Translate, for being more useful than a dictionary for once), which seems to be right in this context (In this case, "I know you're feeling confused"). That's why I think it might be a special case. (Searching よお on it's own ended up with "trouble brought on by sins of forebears"...)
Consider the two sentences below:(1) 私のほうが田中さんよりよく飲む。(I drink more than Mr. Tanaka.)(2) 私はビールより酒のほうをよく飲む。(I drink more sake than beer.)I think the pattern for the second one is a reverse of the first to put the direct object in closer proximity to the verb so the sentence feels smoother.EDIT: By "reverse" I meant "reverse of each other" as opposed to "reverse of the "correct" construction". And I also learned that ほう precedes より by default in sentences involving comparison except when there is a direct object marked by を. (I may be wrong so please don't hesitate to correct me)(Question) But if it is not a direct object, does it have any difference in meaning or nuancei.e. Instead of (1), I change the sentence to:(1') 田中さんより私のほうがよく飲む。
皆さんこんにちは、日本語で質問がお聞きしてみたいのですが、言葉や文法を間違えたらお許しください。では、「かしこまりました」とは誰かに命令や注文を頼まれた場合などの返事とすることもよくありますが、「かしこまる」と言う自動詞がこの表現以外で使われる場合はありますか？"kashikomarimashita" is usually used as a response to somebody's order or request, but are there places where the verb "kashikomaru" is used other than in this expression
There seems to be a tendency to have a heading (or emphasized text) in English, but the body of the text in Japanese.For example, Tokyo train stations have posters with Saving Electricity in English, and the body in Japanese, and this anti-groping poster only has "NO" in English (which would only make sense if it's adding emphasis rather than informing an English-only reader), and this is an apparent example of English being used as a heading or for emphasis.Assuming that the English isn't for the benefit of foreigners, is there a term (either Japanese or English) for such English text
This question already has an answer here:                                            Closed 9 years ago.Possible Duplicate:～うございます - keigo い-adjectives I still remember the introductory lecture of the first Japanese course I took in college, my sensei told the class that おはようございます does not mean "good morning" but it is actually derived from はやいです which simply means "it is early".Some time later, I've been told that this honorific formation of i-adjectives is not restricted to はやい only, but can be applied to any i-adjectives. I've not been told how though.I'm assuming that for any i-adjectives that end with X-ai, they become o-X-ou:はやい → おはよう  たかい → おたこうBut what about adjectives that end with -ui, -ii etc Turning them into -ou does not sound right. For example:さむい → おさもう  たのしい → おたのしょう  おおきい → おおおこう  　[triple お]What are the rules for turning i-adjectives into honorific form And also, are this honorific still in use today and in what kind of scenarios
I'm wondering what does 食べやすい mean exactly "easily-eaten" doesn't seem to make any sense at all.. Does 食べやすい mean that something is soft and easy to swallow, or does it mean that something tastes niceDoes 食べにくい mean something that is hard to bite/swallow
皆さんこんにちは、日本語で質問を聞かせていただきますので、ご協力ください。回答やコメントなどは、日本語か英語、どちらの言語でも喜んで読みます。では。此間友達と喋っていて好みの話をしていた時一人が「ホラー映画やB級映画が大好き」と言うやいなや「あなた安いな〜」ともう一人が反応しました。その「安い」は、英語に「cheap」と直訳すれば同じ意味が通じるそうなので、もしかしたら英語からきた表現じゃないかと思ってきました。(その逆もありえるのですが、あんまり想像できません)。JLUの皆さん、どう思いますか？偶然に意味も言葉も合うか、または英語とかから日本語に導入された表現でしょうか？宜しくお願いします。
Apart from using verb-specific humble and honorific versions (e.g. 参る &lt; 行く &lt; いらっしゃる), the general method of turning a verb into humble is by using お+[verb stem aka 連用形]+する while the general method of turning a verb into honorific is by using お+[verb stem aka 連用形]+になる. For example:Neutral: 泊まります  Humble: お泊まりします  Honorific: お泊まりになりますLinguistically, how do the two constructions respectively introduce the honorific and humble nuances to the verb, i.e +になる introduces honorific-ness while +する introduces humbleness What are their origins
I am aware that the phrase 「おかわり」 that is used when asking for second helping (of meals especially) is an idiomatic expression, so its usage is understood as it is. But, I'm curious about the origin of this phrase because it seems to be derived from 替わる / 代わる(P) / 換わる, which means "to be exchanged/switched". How did this phrase come into the usage Is it the case that in the past when people asked for second helping, something was exchanged (bowl, chopsticks etc)
Soon I am leaving my job and I would like to leave an e-mail for future correspondence with my colleagues. How do I write in Japanese something like "Please direct all your future correspondence to my private email"I could go with some simple expression like: 今からメールをemailへ書いていただけますか, but there probably exist better ways to express it.Thank you!
Well, 以上 is used after a speech to indicate that the speech has been concluded　(i.e., 'Everything before this has been said.').  以上 is used in numbers to mean 'or more', as in 八十%以上 (as in, 'Everything after this is included.').  If you want to say, "80% or less", you say 八十%以下 or 八十％以外 for "anything but 80%".  Are 以上 and 以上 only homonyms and homophones, or are the words somehow synonymous, by definition
Text books normally teach that the negative of です is じゃありません.However it seems very common to hear native Japanese use じゃないです. Is this slang or somehow less correct than じゃありません Would it be marked as incorrect in a JLPT exam If they are both equally correct why is じゃありません taught to beginners(To me じゃないです seems simpler for a beginner to remember.)

Is there an expression in Japanese that is equivalent to "as far/long as I/you X", for example "as far as I know", "as far as I'm concerned", "as much as you want", "as long as he is still alive" etc Or perhaps are all those English expressions expressed differently in JapaneseSome example sentences:As far as I know, it only takes 15 minutes to travel from Kyoto to Osaka by bullet train.As far as I'm concerned, that kind of questions is not suitable to be asked here.Please take as much as you want. He is working hard to achieve that golden dream of his as long as he is alive.EDIT: One more expression: "as soon as possible"
There is female Japanese name "Midori," and I want to know the ways I can write it. I know it means "green," but maybe the name and "green" are different words sometimes.I used google-translator to get variants. I want to know if all of those variants are used to write the name Midori. Otherwise I am interested in what they mean.緑翠As far as I can understand, the first variants are kanji and next ones are hiragana:ミドリみどり and みどりのWhat is the difference between these What does the "no" mean
The textbook I'm currently using defines both of these grammar points as: 〜のだから、絶対にする／しないのが当然だWhat is the difference between the two grammar points, can they be used interchangeably like the following:  自分でやると言ったからには、最後まで責任を持ってやってください。vs自分でやると言った以上は、最後まで責任を持ってやってください。  If they can be used interchangeably, is there any nuance I should be aware of
Is there a term that describes multiple foreign words sharing the same Japanese-language loanwordFor example, Wikipedia's disambiguation page for フォーク (Romaji: foku) covers both the English word "fork" and the English word "folk", because Japanese-speakers don't have "r" and "l" different.

Is it true that 寂しい can be used to describe someone as "pathetic"  (pathetic in the sense like someone is cheating in a game: pathetic. and like someone is robbing a grandma: pathetic. and like someone who doesn't wish to work and just wanted to live off others: pathetic)The dictionaries I use only list them as "lonely, lonesome, solitary, desolate" so I'm wondering if the "pathetic" meaning of 寂しい is widely used (or used at all)
There are a number of Japanese words which have distinct compounding forms:-a/-e alternation: 天・雨、酒、上、風、目 — many examples.-u/-i alternation: 神（[神]{かむ}[集]{つど}ふ）、月（[月]{つく}[読]{よみ}）-o/-i alternation: 木（[木]{こ}の[葉]{は}）、火（炎【ほのほ】）-a/-o alternation: 白（[白]{しら}[雪]{ゆき}）This BBS post has more examples. There is also another kind of alternation I know of, even rarer:s-insertion: 雨（[春]{はる}[雨]{さめ}）、青（[真]{ま}っ[青]{さを})I have three questions:Are there any other alternations I have missedIs there an exhaustive listing of words with exceptional compound forms somewhereTo what extent is this process still alive For instance, [風]{かざ}[車]{ぐるま} is a comparatively recent coinage.
Was nihonshu (what English refers to as "sake") always called nihonshu, or was it only called that once western alcoholic beverages were introduced to Japan
What is the learning curve like for learning Japanese writingAre you able to use what you've learnt as you're progressing, or are you only realistically able to start reading real text once you've learnt about two or three thousand kanjiRelated question: What are the advantages/disadvantages of writing in romaji instead of in kanji and kana has a few answers on the merits of learning Japanese writing.Edit: By "real text", I meant text you'd encounter in real life, not learning text that has had its grammar artificially dumbed down. As an example of "dumbing down", I've heard that texts deliberately made up entirely of kana is only for children too young to know the kanji. By contrast, signs and menus, even if they're not literary masterpieces, haven't had their grammar artificially changed. Would learning the kana be enough to identify a few gairaigo items in a fast food restaurant menu, for example
How do I form a sentence pattern for:The more/less X happens, the more/less Y happensE.g. The more you stir, the faster the salt dissolves.The colder the weather, the more time it takes for snow to melt.
Examples first.空 {そら}.Almost all compound nouns for which 空 is the second component pronounce it as ぞら zora:青空 {あおぞら}夜空 {よぞら}星空 {ほしぞら}.There is at least one exception though: 美空 {みそら}.蕎麦 {そば}.All compound nouns I found so far retain the そ so syllable as unvoiced:狸蕎麦 {たぬきそば}月見蕎麦 {つきみそば}焼そば {やきそば}.心 {こころ}.Many change it to ご go: 物心 {ものごころ}乙女心 {おとめごころ}But some can be pronounced both ways:恋心 = こいこころ / こいごころ真心 = まこころ / まごころThis also extends to the on'yomi: 用心 {ようじん} vs 欲心 {よくしん}.Finally, the question: what are the criteria that determine whether the second component's first syllables get voiced or remain unvoiced in compound words
When does one use 欲しがる instead of 欲しい  For example, in phrases like:先生は野菜を食べて欲し​｛いです・がっています｝。 My incomplete understanding is that the がる form is more formal/polite, but it can only be used when the subject is not currently present in the room.  The "subject in the room part" is the part I'm most unsure about, as it doesn't seem right.Could I say this to my teacher  先生は野菜を食べて欲しがっていますかTo clarify the above sentence.  What i was trying to say was "Sensei, do you want me to eat vegetables"
I noticed that some i-adjectives have specific prefixes that can be used to intensify the quality of the states that are described by the adjectives, similar to "flaming hot", "freezing cold" etc in English. Some examples:物{もの}凄{すご}い 蒸{む}し暑{あつ}い  膚{はだ}寒{さむ}い  [容易]{たやす}い  手{て}厳{きび}しい  真{ま}新{あたら}しいWith color adjectives, there is 真 which intensifies as well as makes the i-adjectives into na-adjectives:真{ま}っ白{しろ}  真{ま}っ黒{くろ}  真{ま}っ赤{か}  真{ま}っ青{さお}    However, there are prefixes that focus rather than intensify the i-adjectives. Examples for 苦しい {くるしい}:重{おも}苦{くる}しい = gloomy, heavy (focus on the atmosphere)  息{いき}苦{ぐる}しい = choking, suffocating (focus on the air)  寝{ね}苦{ぐる}しい = unable to sleep well (focus on the sleeping/rest) 見{み}苦{ぐる}しい = ugly (focus on the look)  狭{せま}苦{くる}しい = cramped (focus on the space) 堅{かた}苦{ぐる}しい = strict (focus on the flexibility)  So my questions are:Is there special categories and treatment for these prefixes in Japanese languageAre there websites/resources/lists where I can look up if a particular i-adjective has an intensifier or not

Excerpt from a JLPT practice question:Background information: the writer was looking for rental apartments.次に行ったところは小さい会社ですが、そこの人は大変優しい人でした。　それにいいアパートもたくさんありました。　私はその中[Blank]好きな家を借りました。　今、住んでいるアパートより少し高いですが、新しくきれいなアパートです。The answer is given as から. (but it's not as important why から is correct than why で and に　is wrong)(Question 1) Why can't I use で to fill the blank(Question 2) Why can't I use に　to fill the blank eitherMy thoughts leading up to choosing で：その中(in the 会社) is a place where the verb 借りる occurs.My thoughts leading up to choosing に:その中　is the place where the writer is. Hence その中に.My thoughts trying to justify the use of から:The demonstrative その中 is referring to "the choice of apartments" rather than "the office where the choice is being offered"Hence その中から would mean "from the choice of apartments" rather than "from the office where the choice is being offered"(My initial thoughts were その中 referred to "the office where the choice is being offered)(Clarification Point) What is the demonstrative その中 referring to

In modern Japanese, the kana ゑ/ヱ (we) and ゐ/ヰ (wi) are largely obsolete. Words formerly containing them now are pronounced with /e/ and /i/, so they were replaced by え and い, respectively.But when referring to the letters themselves, it would be ambiguous to pronounce them like that. So what are the names of ゑ and ゐ currently That is, how do you refer to those letters in speech
Sitting in a restaurant yesterday I saw a sign advertising a mango flavoured bagel. It was described as トロピカルな味.That just got me wondering... whenever a 外来語【がいらいご】(word taken from a foreign language / "loan word") is used as an adjective, is it always a な adjectiveAre there any examples of loanword い adjectivesAre there any general guidelines as to how loan words are made to conform to Japanese adjective rules.(Please note I'm not familiar with linguistics, so even though I'm asking a fairly technical grammatical question, please dumb it down for me as much as possible. Thanks!)
Consider the sentence:今度の旅行は全部で何人行きますか。I would roughly translate it literally to:For this trip, in the domain of "total"(abstract location), how many people will be going"And then more naturally as:How many people in total are going on this tripMy conjecture: で is taking on the role of "location where a verb/event occurs".(Question 1) What is the role of で for this type of usageOther things for your consideration:JMDict and WWWJDIC categorises 全部 as:Adverbial Noun (副詞的名詞)(Q1.1),noun (temporal) (jisoumeishi)(Q1.2)(Q1.1) But I don't think 全部で acts adverbially to modify the verb　行く. Am I right (Please correct me if I'm wrong)(Q1.2) I don't think this part is relevant right (Again please correct me if I'm wrong)
I would like to know what's the difference of じゃん and だろう／でしょう.the meaning I know it's similar, but when I should use each of themIs it same to say:これはすごいじゃん！　＝　これはすごいでしょう！　＝　これはすごいだろう！昨日、楽しかったじゃん？　＝　昨日、楽しかったでしょう？　＝　昨日、楽しかっただろう？できるじゃん！　＝　できるでしょう！thanks

If you look in the dictionary for the definition of 氏 you'll find it defined as: family name; lineage; birth.However I have seen it used in such a way that it is doubtful that it means any of those things in certain contexts.Here's an example sentence:今日はマオ氏のアーバンカーで送ってもらった♪(´ε｀ )What does 氏 mean hereNote: Mao is a very famous Japanese singer.

This question about colours got me thinking:Why, and how, did オレンジ come to replace 橙【だいだい】 to refer to the colour orangeIt seems weird to me that a word taken from a foreign language became adopted as the norm when there seem to already have been a perfectly good local word for the same thing.I've seen 橙 used very occasionally, but it seems to be reserved for deliberately attaching a Japanese style, or 和風【わふう】, context beyond just describing the colour.
I understand that 適当【てきとう】 can mean both "appropriate" and "whatever/vague". How do you know 適当な人を教えてください means "please inform me of the appropriate person" as opposed to "please tell me about whatever kind of person you want" Is this determined entirely by contextBecause 加減【かげん】 means "condition", いい加減 seems to be "good condition" -&gt; only the "reasonable" definition comes naturally. Yet using it to mean "irresponsible" is standard (いい加減に仕事をするな), except when you tell people いい加減にしなさい. Where did that come fromI saw this question in 日本人の知らない日本語 but no explanation was given. I am living in Japan but none of my Japanese friends can explain it either.
This question about alternate terms for coins focused on the use of ワンコイン, but it got me thinking about slang terms for money in general.In all the years I've been in Japan, I don't think I've regularly heard people use slang terms for money they way they do in, say, North America.In Canada, everyone routinely uses "loonies" to refer to the one dollar coin.A guy from the US recently said to me, "it's all about the Benjamins." Bucks, greenbacks, cheddar, and more are a matter of regular conversation.I could probably say, "it's all about the Fukuzawas," but I think they would see it more as me at play than using a commonly accepted slang.On the coin level, in North American English, we almost exclusively use quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies in place of "25 cent coins", "10 cent coins", and so on.By contrast, I can't think of anyone referring to a hundred yen coin in any way except its value, 百円{ひゃくえん}.Am I right in thinking that Japanese on the whole don't really feel a compulsion to give nicknames to their units of currency A little web searching hasn't turned up a wealth of terms that I was unaware of, but my Google-fu is always a little lacking in Japanese.By the way, bonus karma points for anyone who can translate "it's all about the Fukuzawas." I can't figure out how to convey the vague "it" part which refers in a vague way to life or living or "the reason to do stuff".
I came across this sentence in a manga:なにすんじゃこんガキャ―――！！There is no kanji use in that speech-bubble, making it hard to work out the meaning. In fact, I haven't been able to find the meaning of anything past なに (which I already knew means "what").What does it mean when the whole sentence is in kana(And, as a side question that I hope is related, all-kana doesn't seem like it should make the sentence that much harder to translate, but I can't seem to find any of the combinations characters aside from なに and possibly すんじ (which ignores the ゃ and doesn't seem to fit the context anyway). So is there something that I'm missing here)
I'm writing a short (3-5 page) business plan in Japanese.I'd like to include an "estimate" of the sales for the next 3 years.The question: what would you choose for the graph titled:2012 Fiscal Year Sales Projections2012年度の売上高の________I've seen words like 目標 and ノルマ used to refer to a sales target/sales "budget" -- e.g. how much sales a company expects a person, team, or division to achieve.I use 予算 more frequently to discuss a client's budget (i.e. for spending, not for earning) for a project, as in the construct:ご予算はどのぐらいをお考えですか。About how much are you thinking to budget for this projectBut I've also heard 予算 used to discuss the "budget" that a company must achieve in terms of sales. That said, something like 推計 translates nicely in English as "estimate" or "estimation", and given that I'm trying to plan a business sales plan for 2.5 years from now, I'd say "estimate" in English is a pretty good sense of what I'm doing -- it's just a few stages short of a "SWAG" :).Any feedback is appreciated.

Lately ふう has been on my mind. Often it seems interchangeable with よう:これを｛こんなふう／このよう｝にしてください。 Please make it like this.あれを｛どういうふう／どのよう｝に解釈しますか。 In what way do you interpret that家を出るとき、帰りにケーキを買ってきてという｛ふう／よう｝に言われました。 When I was about to leave, I was told to pick up some cake on the way back.QuestionsWhen ふう and よう are used in this way to mean "manner" or "like":Are they always interchangeableIs there any difference in nuance
For example, 'a tennis master'
I'm not familiar with either word, but just looking at the characters, 達人 would seem to indicate 'accomplished' (ie an accomplished pianist). While 名人 seems more like 'renowned'. Is that a valid assessment
Is it true that the べつに when used to mean "nothing particularly" is pronounced differently from when it is used to mean "separately / apart" Like am I right to say that these 3 examples belong to the same "sound":たまに朝飯を抜いたって別に悪いことじゃない。「何を考えてるの？」「別に・・・」べつにいがみあっている敵同士ではあるまいし。and these other 3 belong to a different "sound":ニンジンは別にして、彼が食べないものはない。ソースを別にください。別にサービス料を申し受けます。Also I was wondering whether this sentence 私は別に怪しい者ではありません。 will belong to the first category or the second one
I found this particular proverb on WWWJDIC when I looked up for なんじ : [艱難]{かんなん}[汝]{なんじ}を[玉]{たま}にす. It is translated into English as: Hardship makes the man.How do we parse the proverb I know 艱難 {かんなん} means "hardship". But 汝 {なんじ} means "thou" (archaic 'you') so what nuance does it contribute when suffixed to 艱難 And does 玉 {たま} mean jewel or actually refer to the family jewels And what about にす, is it an archaic verb, or simply abbreviation of にする How are all these in the end summed up as "hardship makes the man"

I am familiar with contraction of の to ん before です (and variants で, だ, でした etc) but I noticed that の is also contracted before 家 in spoken set-phrases like あたしんち and おれんち. Are there any other instances where の is contracted before some particular nouns I remember hearing おれんとこ in some anime/jdrama but I might have misheard.Also, are there any dialects that utilize these types of contractions more frequently than the other colloquial dialects

Sometimes a Japanese person will say to me:そんなに丁寧な言葉を使わなくてもいいんですよ。This is an invitation to be less formal. But how much less formal As I have experienced, sometimes unintentional gaffes can be committed blithely as one learns to navigate the treacherous waters of the politeness hierarchy. Note that the expression itself uses です even though it is a request to use less formal speech, and that is the level of politeness  I would normally be using. So I find the whole matter confusing. The eternal politeness dance ...Now, here's the catch: I feel it would be rude to ask something like "What level of politeness do you suggest I use" That might come off as sarcastic or, worse, a rebuke. Any adviceEdit to add more detailAn example of this kind of occurrence: At a lunch after a business meeting, I was using standard TV keigo: desu, -masu, plus o- and go- where appropriate, plus a bit of nasaimasu and itashimasu to senior people. The gentleman seated across from me (on about the same level as me), said this rather matter-of-factly. Honestly, I really wish he hadn't said this. It was like saying "Don't worry about the snakes, just stick your hand in there."
In Japanese mathematics, the word ‘functor’ is translated as 関手【かんしゅ】. What is the etymology of this wordI suspect that it is a pun on 関数 (function). This leads to two further questions:Why 関手 and not 函手 According to Wikipedia 函数 was standard until the late 1950s. Category theory (圏論) was invented in the late 1940s, and was certainly known in Japan in the 1950s, c.f. Nobuo Yoneda's (米田信夫) work.Why -手 It seems to be the same agentive morpheme -手 as in 運転手、歌手、選手 etc., but these are words referring to people. Moreover (to my knowledge) -手 is not as productive as, say, -者. Either way, it seems unnatural to calque -or like this.To ward off any confusion, I do not mean 関手 as in せきて.
Are there any other verbs than 死ぬ whose plain forms end with ぬ Why are they so rare Is it because the verb 死ぬ itself has special etymology why it ended up having the ぬ ending
I have only found 行 being pronounced as いく, ゆく and おこなう for kun'yomi and as コウ and ギョウ for on'yomi, but my dictionary software also lists down なみ, なめ, みち and アン as the other pronunciations of this kanji.In which words is the kanji 行 pronounced as なみ, なめ, みち or アン
Looking for a phrase that has the same meaning as "May I" in English. One that would work in situations that would indicate I would like to try to solve a problem at hand, or receive control over something. For example, if someone is stuck with a Rubik's cube, or maybe I want a user to get up from a workstation so I can sit down and try a solution.I know I can use words in a sentence to say what I want, but is there a phrase that accomplishes the sameI'm thinking よろしいですか？ could work, but is it enough alone
since 受ける is the same verb associated with "sustaining damage", "incurring losses", "suffering injury", all 3 seemingly have negative nuances, I'm wondering when we use it (受ける) with 試験, does 受ける imply anything on the 試験 are there any clues to the listener what kind of 試験 it isOr is it the case that we cannot derive any traits of the 試験 just by the phrase 試験を受ける because by itself the phrase is a neutral one
The following two sentences, I believe, are grammatically okay, however I'm not sure on how they differ in nuance.もう[歩]{ある}けないほど[疲]{つか}れた！  もう歩けないくらい疲れた！ Additionally, why is it that:[死]{し}ぬほど[恥]{は}ずかしい  is grammatically okay but死ぬくらい恥ずかしい is not (However 死にたいくらい恥ずかしい is okay.)From looking at this, it seems くらい cannot show volition. Is there a logical reason for this that I'm not seeing
For example, the following 3:  女っぽい (おんなっぽい)女らしい (おんならしい)女みたい (おんなみたい)In what situations would you use っぽい over らしい？ Does っぽい have negative connotations Are 女らしい and 女みたい interchangeable as in 彼女は本当に女らしい／彼女は本当に女みたいI would love if someone could contrast these 3 terms.
Consider the following sentence:その薬は去年期限切れのだったので、捨てました。I'm trying to explain what the bolded の does in the above sentence.This is what I came up with:の is used as a back referralThe sentence would look like this :その薬は去年期限切れの(薬)だったので、捨てました。But because 薬 can be understood from context, it is left out in the same sentence.When I looked up 期限切れ in the dictionary*, it is listed as (Nouns which may take the genitive case prt. 'no') I'm not sure what it means exactly so...(Question): Is there something I need to understand differently because of this dictionary categorisation How are "Nouns which may take the genitive case prt. 'no'" different from just nounsWould 日本語 in 日本語の先生 also be a "noun which may take the genitive case prt. 'no'" Because so far many nouns are able to take の, and I dont understand the separate category for it.EDIT: I think this was what I meant to ask - did the の in question come from elision or does it have something to do with 期限切れ being a no-adj (Just looked it up in other dictionaries**, it's labelled as no-adj)*taken from JMDict**checked against WWWJDIC and japanese.nciku.com
The pronunciation "みやげ" does not correspond to on'yomi nor kun'yomi of 土産, so I thought it was a gikun (義訓), but the combination of kanji 土 and 産 does not seem to provide the meaning of "souvenir" either. Based on the pronunciation, I previously thought that it was taken from the verb stem of 見上げる and the meaning "to look up at" does sound like it's related to giving souvenir, but the slight difference in the second syllables of "みやげ" and "みあげ" has a lot to say against this theory. So what was the origin of the word and kanji 土産{みやげ}

My dictionary lists 髭 as moustache / beard, but from the example sentences in WWWJDIC, it seems like 髭 is more often used to mean "beard" than "moustache" So for example, in this sentence: 彼はもっと大人に見えるようにひげをはやした。, is it clear to the listener that the speaker wanted to say "He grew a beard to look more mature", and not "He grew mustache to look more mature" Or is it ambiguous and it could mean either one

I have been in the market for some good synonyms for ときどき, and I encountered one today that I wanted to share, and also ask for some opinions, since I can not find a correct definition online.  The specific use I encountered is:俺実はここんとこずっと同じ夢を見るの subtitle: "Lately I keep having the same dream"Context:http://www.crunchyroll.com/a-dark-rabbit-has-seven-lives/episode-1-900-seconds-of-after-school-part-one-580756 (4 minute 6 second mark)The entry in the Jim Breen dictionary is:此処ん所; ここん所 【ここんとこ】 (n) this place; hereAnd I think this is wrong, I think it is of the same general variety as ときどき, ときに, and たまに.  However, I think it probably has a bit of a different nuance as well.  I think that the use here, as well as uses I find in Googling for it, are showing that ここんとこ is good for showing that a phenomena has started happening and is currently still happening on and off.  I should qualify that observation by noting that I just totally made that up myself.  I also see some uses that might be referring to something physical, simply as a replacement for このところ, but I'm not entirely sure.  Oh, and ここんところ seems to substitute without any real difference in meaning.Obviously I want to ask if anyone can give a definition with confidence.  I would also like to know how this word would fit into your arsenal of words to express occasional occurrences, which is something I'm always wanting more precise words for.  If I had to express the idea in my example I might have said 最近ときどき, which sounds kind of clumsy now.Thanks in advance!  I'm new here, and I'll be taking a stop by meta soon to ask some more questions about how to use Japanese SE effectively.

I sometimes find that when Japanese answer my questions, their answers are too vague. For instance, I asked what つなぎ is in a given context.

While attempting to translate the sentence "It will soon be two years since I started learning Japanese", I started wondering how になります works in the context of time. Ignoring any other translation errors, is になります the correct word to use at the end of the sentence日本語を勉強し始めてからもうすぐ二年になりますFor some reason, the になります sounds like it is incorrect. My main reason for using になります is in order to keep the 'becoming' part of the original sentence. Something like日本語を勉強し始めたのは二年前のことですholds a vaguely similar meaning, but is more like "I started learning Japanese two years ago"Is my usage of になります here correct, and is it common to use it when talking about timeI often hear my friends say もうすぐ10時ですね, but is it also correct to say もうすぐ10時になりますね Even typing that, it seems as though it can't be correct, perhaps because になります needs some sort of state to transfer into The sentence もうすぐ10時になりますから、そろそろ帰りましょうか seems like an appropriate usage, but I really don't know.
I've heard that the number four attracts superstition because of its similarity with the word for death. For example, yon is used instead of shi in some circumstances, and sometimes the number 4, along with some other numbers is avoided.Does the Roma-ji letter "C" attract any superstition, as it is usually pronounced "shi" (for example, CD is pronounced "shi dee") Or are the pronunciations different
This is a question taken from a JLPT excercise workbook.Person A: 新聞をよく読みますか。Person B: そうですね。毎日は[Fill in this blank]。I am given 4 choices, of which only 2 are conjugated correctly.Choice 1: 読みますChoice 2: 読みませんTo me it seems both options answer the question, since そうですね in this case should be just a 相槌 (interjection used to indicate that the listener is still participating in the conversation), and should not be a consideration factor between Choice 1 and 2.According to the workbook, Choice 2 is the correct answer. Is there an explanation for this Or can I just dismiss this as a poorly constructed question in the workbookAfter considering what Dave said about は. I've come up with some explanation.This question should have been about the disambiguating function of は.Person A: Do you read the newspapers frequentlyPerson B: 毎日は[Fill in the blank].The domain that A establishes is "frequently"B is using は to extract 毎日 from "frequently" as a given premise. (Since the concept of "everyday" is a subset of "frequently")This begs the question of why it's wrong when B says the following:毎日読みません毎日は読みます
I was recently trying to make an open-ended enumeration of places in a construction that would require the use of a に particle. E.g.:AやBに行こうor even:A[and the like]に行こうPreferably using a stronger indicator of open-endedness, such as 等 (to me や only has a weak implication of other possibilities, whereas here I want to convey the idea of "places like A [or B]"). But then I realised that the combination of に and 等 did not sound quite right, and even if it was, I had no idea how it would go (Aに等 A等に)...Thus my question: Can 等 (or a suitably similar word for "and the like") ever be used with a に/で construction (not necessarily just locations... Tools or "means" as well: AやBで行こう)

This question is based on the discussion arising from "Unsolvable Problem"Start of ExcerptRelevant discourse extracted from "Unsolvable Problem":Quoted from Derek Schaab's reply to "Unsolvable Problem":○ （私は）この問題{もんだい}が解{と}けない。 [I] can't solve this problem.× この問題は解けられない。 This problem can't solve itself.The second sentence might sound fine at first (from a grammatical standpoint), but when you think about it, assigning an ability to an inanimate subject doesn't work here. (Even in English, the better way to express the idea behind sentence #2 is, "This problem will not solve itself.")Because of this, only 解{と}けない問題 is correct.Also from Derek Schaab's reply to "Unsolvable Problem":istrasci also mentioned the ～にくい suffix. I was about to agree with this, but then I saw sawa's edit which reminded me that 解く can be read as both とく and ほどく, and 解ける can be read as both とける and ほどける. (The meanings differ between readings.) ～にくい can be attached to both ほどく and ほどける, such as in this way:ほどきにくいくつひも a shoelace that is difficult to untieほどけにくいくつひも a shoelace that won't come undone easily…and to とく, but not to とける:○ ときにくい問題 a problem that's difficult to solve× とけにくい問題 End of Excerpt(Question 1) Why is ほどけにくい acceptable while とけにくい unacceptable Following the logic of "I cannot assign ability to an inanimate subject", it should cause both to be unacceptable since both are intransitive and by extension force the existence of the "inanimate subject"(Question 2) If it is true that there are cases for which Intransitive+にくい are acceptable, does it imply that there are cases for which Intransitive+られる (Potential form) are acceptable(EXTRA Question 2.1) If there are cases for which Intransitive+られる (Potential form) are acceptable, how do we decide if we can assign ability/potential to an inanimate subjectAppendix: Other points taken from the comments in "Unsolvable Problem" for your considerationFrom Derek Schaab:Could it be related to whether the verb expresses a continuous or discrete change ～にくい, when it means なかなか～しない, seems to imply that the verb may happen only gradually over a period of time, but never quickly and easily. Because of the gradual transition, a continuous-change verb (such as ほどける or 燃{も}える) is required. But 解{と}ける expresses a discrete change: a problem is either solved or it isn't, and the change from unsolved to solved takes place instantly. Perhaps this is why 解{と}けにくい sounds odd, but other combinations, such as 溶{と}けにくい, work.From Matt:But you can say 割{わ}れにくい, and that is instantaneous. Perhaps 〜eにくい has some sort of restriction relating to concrete vs abstract subjects

Many things that seem normal in English look arrogant in Japanese. I think I found a special case where the reverse is true. In Japanese is it normal to speak in the third person when referring to oneself I have seen this done before on Twitter. What about in face to face conversation or other conversational situations Is it normal to refer to oneself in the third personWhenever I try to speak in the third person about myself in English I always get accused of looking pompous. This is not the case in JapaneseWhat's the difference when using the third person to refer to oneself instead of words like 私、僕、or 俺？

Note: This question may contain wordings that may be considered rude to some, so proceed with open mind and caution.One of the legacies of Japanese colonization in my country during WW2 is a rude slang name-calling word "bagero" which roughly means "stupid bastard", which I could easily map to the similarly sounding colloquial phrase バカヤロウ soon after I started learning Japanese. The people at that time probably could not make out what they heard and simply understood the interjection as "bagero".However, I am still wondering if the "bagero" version really came from the people mishearing "バカヤロウ", or there was a dialect that really pronounced バカヤロウ as バゲロ. Was thereThere is also a longer version of the localized interjection, "bagero kuntoroyo", that I still cannot decipher until now. Can anyone suggest what would be the original Japanese bad words, if anyN.B. My purpose of asking this question is not to learn about the bad words, but simply out of curiosity about this phrase that are (fortunately becoming rarely) used by local people here who are oblivious of its actual meaning.
What is the correct construction of "unsolvable problem" Is it "解{と}けられない問題{もんだい}"？(Question 1)Plain(intransitive): 解{と}ける "To be solved".Potential form(of intransitive): 解けられる "can be solved".Potential + Negated(of intransitive): 解けられない "cannot be solved"Plain(transitive) 解{と}く "(Some agent) solves".Potential form(of transitive): 解ける "(Some agent) can solve".　Potential + Negated(of transitive): 解けない "(Some agent) cannot solve"Does 解けられない問題 mean it intrinsically cannot be solved (Question 2)Does the transitive version "解けない" implies that some agent is unable to solve, but does not mean it is absolutely unsolvable (Question 3)*(Agent: one who initiates and/or completes an action or event)

EDIT: Started a bounty with hope of getting more definitive and elaborate answers, e.g. timeline of when color names started being used in Japan.In Japanese language, there are colors that are i-adjectives: 青い, 赤い, 黒い, 白い etc. Then there are colors that are original nouns: 緑 {みどり}, 紫 {むらさき} etc.And finally color nouns that are made of [something]-色: 茶色 {ちゃいろ}, 黄色 {きいろ} , 灰色 {はいいろ}, 桃色 {ももいろ}, 銀色 {ぎんいろ} etc.Why are there different word classes for colors in Japanese Is it because they have different historical backgrounds and etymologies

I am looking for terms in the Japanese language which can describe the act of flirting in a positive light. This probably requires inventing terms to close a lexical gap, because as far as I know, all terms that are related to flirting in Japanese carry a negative connotation."Flirting" has a couple of meanings in English. However, here I am speaking specifically about flirting in the sense of when a person shows their attraction to another person. It's a deliberate act, and can range from covert to overt.The thing is, where I come from, flirting generally is seen as a playful, positive thing. It is flattering to the recipient. It is also can be considered harmless, in that it might be that the person doing it does not necessarily intend to seduce the other, but that they want to test the limits of their attractiveness by provoking a small response.The only time flirting is negative in English is when a larger context makes it so. If a person flirts with a third person while in a committed relationship, the action of flirting itself is not what defines it as negative, it's that the committed relationship comes with an implication of promises that are being broken.In Japanese, however, all the terms I know of that approximate the act of flirting tend toward the negative.浮気する【うわきする】 is all about cheating, so this is clearly the dark side of flirting.ナンパする I would translate as "to hit on," and it is clearly much more aggressive than "flirting". With ナンパ one necessarily has the goal of seducing the other. The feeling of the word to me is of a meat-market night club, although I know it can be used in much more mild and neutral circumstances.いちゃつく might be the most mild, and therefor the closest to the English. However, it does seem a bit cutesy, like a child's view on flirting ("... sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g..."). Also seems almost entirely on the overt end of flirting, in that it is more like a public display of affection, like kissing and holding, than it would imply any clever or subtle behaviour or words.In essence, I want to convey the idea of being at play with showing and getting signals of attraction without it necessarily taking on an aggressive sexuality. Flirting can be a sophisticated interaction between adults.Is there a way to convey flirting in the positive light I am describingIs there a way to say "I'm not really hitting on you, I'm just flirting." Something like:実際はナンパじゃなくって、ただ___しているだけだ。
Update: There seems to be some controversy here as to whether or not there really is a difference between vouching and guaranteeing, which impacts how it is translated. Please see the discussion I started on English L&amp;U about this, where I believe the answers are supporting the idea that there is a difference, and explain what that difference is.Japanese does not seem to have a readily available equivalent for the concept of "vouching" for someone when you are introducing someone for work, or as a possible date, or whenever there is some kind of favour involved and it's not just social.To be more accurate, in Japanese culture, when one introduces someone else, the default assumption is that you are vouching for that person.Which means that just about any and every introduction comes with a fair amount of responsibility. Which might be fine, except Japanese tend to err on the side of caution by being hesitant to make introductions, for whatever purpose, for fear that something might go wrong.The words the dictionary provides for "vouch" is 保証【ほしょうする】, or 請け合う【うけあう】, both of which mean "guarantee", which is much too strong. I think because the default assumption is that any introduction comes with a sense of vouching for that person, to then add words only stresses the assurance, not qualify it.The problem with anything like "guaranteeing", is that it implies that if something goes wrong, you can come back to me, either for compensation, or maybe just to punch me in the stomach, or something.In English language and culture, when I'm vouching for someone, I am telling you about the content of their character. What transpires from their actions is between you and them. Guaranteeing is about putting assurance on future actions and transactions.So is there a way in Japanese I can say I'm vouching for the person without guaranteeing their future actionsAlso, can I qualify a meeting by saying I'm not vouching for someone In other words, despite the fact that this introduction is to help you with something, I'm only making the introduction because I'm trying to help, but I don't know the person I'm introducing well enough to give you any assurance.This is somewhat a cultural issue as well as a language issue, which means I wouldn't expect there's some perfect term that I simply haven't discovered yet. If this is a concept that has to be described in some way so as to introduce it to the language, then let's concoct something new.
One of my coworkers todays said something like: "Today I have too many 割り込みタスク  so I cannot pay too much attention to  this project"Literally translating it into "interrupting tasks" sounds rather vague,so how would a 割り込みタスク be defined
According to my dictionary, both 照{て}れる and 照{て}れてる mean to be shy, or be awkward.I don't think one is a different verb form of the other. The て+いる form of 照れる would be 照れている, not 照れてる.So I think they're different words, but do they have a difference in meaningAlso, the kanji by itself seems to mean "to shine". Is there some kind of association in the word origin or in the culture between shyness and shining(Please note that the green check will only be awarded to answers that do not rely on technical linguistic terminology to be understood.)

Sometimes I've seen ド as a prefix that adds emphasis to words. So saying someone is ドバカ is saying that they are much more stupid than just バカ.I'm wondering what the origin of ド in this context is. Does it come from 度 【ど】("degree"), as in, "the degree of X is higher"Also, is it always negative I usually see it attached to negative terms, but I don't know if it's exclusively negative.Lastly, is it impolite

How are とても/とっても,　でかい/でっかい, 超 (and others that I have yet to encounter) used differently I figured that for とても/とっても-type difference is that the double-consonant(geminated) version is stronger i.e. a greater intensity and used colloquially.I've also heard "でかい煩い". I presume でかい/でっかい is used with negative connotationsEDIT: (From the anime Aria the Animation, the character Alice frequently uses でかい as an intensifier in the ungrammatical way as in "でかい煩い". I now understand it as her 口癖) How about 超 in "超安い" for "very cheap" (price of object) What would be the difference if I swap them aroundAre there other qualitative intensifiers that would be good to know And what differences in nuance would there be

From WWWJDIC:愛 【あい】 (n,n-suf) (See 愛する) love; affection;恋 【こい】 (n) love; tender passion;My understanding on affection, love and tender passion is like the following:affection &lt; love &lt; tender passionIf I may line up all three in a spectrum in term of the strength of the emotion involved, I imagine 愛 covers the lower end of the spectrum while 恋 covers the higher end. The adjectives that are derived from these two nouns seem to conform to it:愛しい 【いとしい】 (adj-i) lovely; dear; beloved; darling;恋しい 【こいしい】 (adj-i) yearned for; longed for; missed;However, when the two kanji characters are combined with 人 to refer to the person that is the target of each type of love:愛人 【あいじん】 (n) lover; mistress;恋人 【こいびと】 (n) lover; sweetheart;Apparently the two 'loves' swap places, with my assumption being:sweetheart &lt; lover &lt; mistressWhat's going on Am I not getting the nuances for both nouns for 'love' rightN.B. I don't mind getting philosophical answers here so please go all out if you must ;)
I am at present rigorously studying 擬音語／擬態語 (an entire world of its own!).The definition my book has for ぼちぼち (also ぼつぼつ) is:1. Gradually; slowly but steadily2. Used to describe something that is about to happen.  Imminently.  Right away.3. The condition of many dots or other small objects scattered around.Ignoring definition 3, definition 1 seems nearly identical to どんどん and だんだん:ぼちぼち　←→　どんどん　←→　だんだんand definition 2 seems nearly identical to そろそろ:ぼちぼち　←→　そろそろIs this correct  If so, are they freely interchangeable in a given situation, etc.  Can someone explain any nuances amongst them
I've seen this phrase a couple of times but couldn't read the Kanji so I don't remember it.

I've been listening songs and anime dialogues that end sentences with ～もの or even cuter version ～もん for so long that I am able to see how the word denotes reasons or excuses like:おなか空{す}いたもん (when the character was asked why she finished the cake all by herself)I have no problem with the grammatical structure of the sentences that end with ～もの when the words before もの are verbs or adjectives, but I am confused when the words that precede the もの are nouns, they need to put the copula だ or です before the もの, for example:好きだもん  女ですものShouldn't it be の or な particles between the nouns and もの How does that work, in term of grammar Or is this usage of もの simply colloquial or slangy that does not have to follow any grammar rule
Today I heard 人形がいる, so I googled around because I thought 居る was only for living things, but I found many examples of this usage. Many for 人形がある as well.Are there other exceptions for いる／ある？
In English:a burglar is usually associated with someone who breaks into a house (victim is usually unaware during the burglary)a robber is usually associated with that person who uses weapons and threatens you to give him your property (victim-aware of course)a mugger is usually associated with a robber on the street (victim-aware)a thief is usually one who sneakily steals things without resorting to violence (victim-unaware)a pickpocket is  usually associated with a thief on the street (victim-unaware)So what exactly is the exact nuance of a 泥棒 perhaps most likely there isn't a 1-to-1 match so probably could someone write an explanation of 泥棒 without using words like robber/mugger/thief/pickpocket/burglar etcSide question: if we change 泥棒 to the hiragana form どろぼう, does it affect the nuance in any way

I noticed that the 前 is a handy kanji character in Japanese language. It is used in many words including but not limited to:名前 {なまえ} : Given name手前, お前 : You[当]{あ}たり[前]{まえ} : Natural, obvious matter出前 : Meal delivery[建]{た}て[前]{まえ} : Public facade男前 {おとこまえ} : Handsome, manly, masculine不足前 {たらずまえ} : Deficit, shortage[持]{も}ち前 {まえ} : Characteristic, nature[分]{わ}け[前]{まえ} : Share, quota板前 {いたまえ} : Chef, cook朝飯前 {あさめしまえ} : Very easy, a piece of cakeTo my knowledge, a kanji character is used in a word because of how the kanji's meaning relates to the word's meaning, except for the case of [当て字]{ateji}, so I imagine that there must be a reason why each of the words above (and many others) uses 前 as the ending kanji character. Does Japanese language and culture have any concept that centers around 前EDIT:It seems like people are misunderstanding my question here. I am not asking how to relate the meaning of the 前 characters to the meaning of the words I listed above. I am asking why are those words built up using the 前 character While we can easily see the relevance of 前 in some of them like 名前 and 建て前, the relevance is not obvious in some others like 出前 and 板前. Does 前 have any significance in the language or culture, that somehow influenced how those words are coined
I just encountered the phrase 「男前な女」in the book I am reading.  When I looked up 男前, it was defined as "good looks in a man," much like "handsome" in English.  What does it mean when used to describe a womanHere is the context:もし、兄の連絡を受けるようにすれば、あの生意気で男前な女の被る負担は少しでも減るのかもしれない。  Roughly: Maybe, if he was willing to put up with his brother's phone calls, he could lighten that cheeky, [] woman's burden just a little.(For what it's worth, the woman in question had been repeatedly described as a conventional beauty.  The man who describes her as an 男前な女 is probably attracted to her but still oblivious at this point.)
Following the current trend of pitting the particles に and で against each other, here is another question that does the same but from another type of usage and perspective.When we want to say "do X before Y", we use "Y 前に X":食べる前に「いただきます」と言う。On the other hand, when we want to say "do X after Y", we use "Y 後で X":食べた後で「ごちそうさまでした」と言う。What is the simplest explanation to explain the differences between 前 and 後 that make 前 goes with に while 後 goes with で in the two situations above
In English, there is a certain etiquette to follow when writing a business letter.  From what I've seen so far, the same seems to be true in Japanese as well.If I was making a business-related request to someone who has helped me a lot in the past, I can start my email with いつもお世話になり、ありがとうございます。  Likewise, if I'm asking someone that has just done something for me, I could use お疲れ様です。However, if I needed to make a business request to someone I don't know well, is there a general opening phrase I could useHow about if I don't know that person well, but they work in my departmentWhat if they were in the same company, but a different departmentWhat about if they worked for another company
Consider the statement A: ホテル（に/で）泊まる. For both cases would translate to "I stay at a hotel" in English. However they are answers to different questions.Consider the questions １．どこに泊まる　and ２．（ホテルで）何をするQuestion 1 would be answered with ホテルに（泊まる）, while Question 2 would be answered with （ホテルで）泊まる. The secondary information is presented in parentheses, and can technically be left out. This shows the role of に in marking a location, and the role of で in marking an incidental location where an action occurs.Consequently, If I present other information using に/で I am in effect emphasizing on the location/action. And for which being more appropriate is dependent on contextual information. (Whether location/action is more important for the listener, or whichever the speaker wants to convey.)Now consider statement B: 部屋（に/で）泣いている. I am told that I cannot analyze Statement B in the same way as Statement A. I think it's because the verb has been conjugated to its continuative form, and cannot be treated in the same way as Statement A. What happens when I try to ask the two questions of "where" and "what" againFrom Sawa’s answer below, my new understanding is if the verb naturally relates to the location (as in the case of ホテルに泊まる）, に should be used. And if it doesn't, で is used.Consider the following statements. I-部屋に読む, II-部屋で読む, III-図書館に読む,　IV-図書館で読む. The verb "read" has no inherent connection with places in general (Reading can be done in a variety of locations). However, "read" is naturally related to "library" as opposed to "room".Question: So, is II more appropriate than I And III more appropriate than IV If it is the case that II&gt;I and III&gt;IV, under what circumstances would I&gt;II and IV&gt;III, and how different would the meaning (or in nuance if any) be in each instance Question: For statementｓ containing に or で. Is it true that if に is replaced by で　(Or the other way around). The sentence immediately stops making sense and is absolutely wrong Are there circumstances for which a statement is grammatically correct and has two separate meanings (or nuance) resulting from a (に/で）　choice
I work in an American subsidiary of a Japanese company.　I met a few Japanese colleagues while working at the home office on an exchange. Do I need to use Keigo for:Colleague A: 1 year younger in age than me and joined the company at a later time. It seems like I could use the desu/masu form without Keigo, but since we belong to different departments, different branches, etc., I'm not sure whether he is in-group or out-group. Colleague B: Not 100% certain about age and seniority, but probably the same age and seniority as me or my junior.Colleague C: 6 years younger than me and much less seniority. Should I use plain forms to talk down to him I decided not to since I wasn't sure whether we were all in-group or considered out-group.

How do I form a sentence of these patterns "X does not arise from Y", "X not due to Y", "X not because of Y", "There are other reasons for X". Since obviously I cannot simply slap ない onto から or ので to form an "anti-causal" particle.Would the below constructions work:Xの原因はYじゃないXの原因はYだけではないXの原因は他があるXはYだからじゃないXでもYはないXとYは関係がないAre there better options for this type of relationship between X and Y Or do more colloquial forms or set phrases exist for stating anti/non-cause I'm not sure if my constructions sound unnatural. The way I constructed those statements feel quite literal to me.

Me and the particle へ don't get along. It's not that we don't like each other, it's that we don't get each other. I'm in a pretty committed relationship with に. I mean, I think I understand what へ aspires to do. へ is focused on the process of going somewhere, and に is focused on the destination. But in practical terms, the difference strikes me as too subtle to really matter. So subtle that I don't know if I've ever uttered へ when speaking Japanese.It seems to be that 「あの場所に行っている」 and 「あの場所へ行っている」 both mean "[I'm] going to that place". However in one case I'm emphasizing the 場所 and in the other I'm emphasizing that I'm 行っている. Hmmm... Whenever I'm speaking, I never invite へ to come along, because I've never felt the need to make that distinction. I've never thought, "does the person I'm talking to understand that I'm going to that place, not just there's a place that I'm going to" Absolutely every time I want to convey an action that involves direction, I find that に always comes through for me.So I wonder, is there any situation where に absolutely cannot replace へ？　Where the meaning would significantly change, or that it would become ungrammaticalHeck, do we even really need へOr have I misunderstood its purpose completely(Please make answers readable by all, with no overly technical linguistic terms. Thanks!)
in "明日、姉とデパート＿買い物に行きます。"why is へ favoured over で in my workbookIf i ask myself the question "明日は、何をする" Can i answer it with "買い物に行く" and make ”デパート”　an incidental location That was how i justified my choice of "で" To justify the choice of へ, I tried to reason like this:If "デパート" is the domain for which "買い物に行く" is true, it would make no sense because there would be no "行く"-ing to be done. "買い物に行く" would only make sense if my domain is outside of "デパート". If my domain cannot be "デパート", I cannot use で to mark it.Am i right Is デパートに買い物に行きます grammatically correct If it is grammatically correct, then how is it different from the case where へ is used To distinguish them, I tried to reason like this:I'm interpreting the case where へ is used to mean "I'm going to the store to shop (but it does not mean all the shopping is going to be done there since へ only ever indicates direction)" and the case of に to mean "I'm going to the store to shop (and only the store which i mentioned will the shopping be done)"Or is it just a simple case of "degree of politeness", and for both cases they mean the same thing just that when へ is used, it's more polite by virtue of referring to the location more indirectly than if に were used
According to Wikipedia, kanji was introduced and imported from chinese hanzi long time ago before Japanese language even had a writing system. From there, Japanese kanji has transformed and evolved from the original hanzi and became what is is today. To my knowledge, it is not clear how long the process took but I'm guessing that, except for modification and simplification, the assimilation has already matured long time ago. Is this trueAre there any kanji characters that were recently (i.e. post-1946 reform) created or imported from hanzi What I mean are characters that were previously still not used in Japanese until they were created or imported from hanzi, not characters that had been assigned new meanings or readings, nor characters that had been simplified like 惡 -&gt; 悪.Related to that, is it possible in the future that newly coined words like むかつく to be assigned brand new kanji characters instead of reusing existing ones

What changes are usually made to the pronunciation of gairaigoI notice that vowels are often added between multiple consonants and to the end of words (eg "programmer" =&gt; "puroguramaa" (プログラマー)), and that sometimes multiple words are turned into portmanteaus (eg "personal computer" =&gt; "pasokon" (パソコン)).Are there other changes madeAdditionally, if you have an English word and you think it may have a gairaigo equivalent, will pronouncing it in a "more Japanese" style make it easier to understand

The "Lonely Planet Tokyo" iPhone app describes female sword fighting as a bygone form of male entertainment:Surprisingly, striptease almost failed to catch on due to the popularity of a rival form of risqué entertainment, namely female sword fighting (to modern ears, the idea of scantily clad jousting females might sound a bit strange, but at the time it was the height of erotic entertainment). Is there a Japanese term that refers to this phenomenon, as opposed to legitimate fighters who just happen to be femaleI tried googling and had no luck, but I heard from "worst jobs in history" that it was a form of entertainment in the United Kingdom.

There are a few books with lists of words and kanji compounds found in the news. Like this one, this one, and this one.However, unless one wants to spend a lot of time doing data entry, they don't lend themselves well to modern flashcard programs, both online and off.I was wondering if there were web pages and sites that might have this kind of thing, so the words can copied more efficiently into one's flashcard programI suppose there are potentially two categories of words, ones that are perennially in newspapers (political, economic, and crime related terms), and ones that try and capture the current zeitgeist (popular people, recent incidents, names of places where things happened.) Both types would be helpful.One with definitions and readings would be best. English would be ideal but not required.On a related note, what would you search for on Google to find this kind of thing I went along these lines:新聞の最近よく使っている言葉... But it didn't get me much.

Warning: This question contains words in both Japanese and English that some might not want to read.Also: My apologies that this question is lengthy. However, I wanted to take care to express it properly.When I asked about words that are not permitted on television, I was trying to get at the concept of what makes a word "bad" in Japanese, because clearly the concept is different than in English. However, that question opened my eyes to the connected, but different issues of political correctness and zeitgeist. It was fascinating and helpful, but I'm still wondering about how Japanese handles curse words.So I am going to come at the question a different way in hopes of getting a definitive answer on something I know plagues many learners of Japanese:Does Japanese actually have swear wordsWe all know the stereotype, which is that when you ask a Japanese person, "what are some curse words in Japanese" they say, "oh, we don't have those." Then one learns of words which seem to be curse words, and the perception is built that the Japanese language does contain curse words, but a culture that wants to be seen as non-confrontational obscures those words from outsiders. Thus a whole bunch of stereotypes about Japan and Japanese people get reinforced, such as the fact that they withhold things from outsiders, or that they are too shy to speak openly about some things, or whatever else.I thought `気違い【きちがい】 was one of those words, until I saw it in a book for kids. Now that I've seen the list of words unsuitable for broadcast, I now know that it's offense doesn't lie in its purpose, but its inappropriateness. It's probably best translated as "psycho", which, in English, is still used as an insult, it's acceptable in a wide variety of contexts, but a news anchor wouldn't say, "police caught the psycho late last night."So one thing one will note about words not suitable for broadcast, is that all of them can, in fact, be on TV, but it's all about when and how.Surprisingly to me, There are some words that are not on the list that I think might count as "dirty words", such as てめえ, 野郎【やろう】, and くそ.I've seen these words translated as "motherfucker", "asshole", and "shit", respectively.However, I've also seen them translated as "you" (although a stern "you"), "rascal", and "damn".That flexibility is crazy to my mind, because in my culture, the purpose of a word like "motherfucker" is to convey an extreme of passions, or an extreme of comradery. You say it with intent to people you really want to know you are mad at, or people who already know you are such good friends that it's a joke. Either way, it conveys extremes.Thus the real question, is if there is a concept of words that are on the other side of a line of general acceptability, like George Carlin's Seven Dirty Words.My concern when I see 野郎 translated as "rascal" is that it's that maybe the word doesn't mean "rascal" at all, but something has been lost in the translation because the context didn't carry over.Put another way, in English, I can call my friend an "asshole" in a joking way that I can get away with because we're friends. So when 野郎 is translated as "rascal", might that not simply be a case where the translator (in a general sense) was worried that the friendly context that made "asshole" acceptable wouldn't be conveyedWith all that context in mind, I hope we can answer "Does Japanese actually have swear words" definitively. I hope an answer can directly or indirectly cover address the following points:Are there words that are always harsh and insulting, that do not range from "you" to "motherfucker" Words that are decidedly curse words (Note I am not asking for a list, I'm asking for an analysis of their place in the language)Is sometimes translating 野郎 to "rascal" actually a fair translation, or is it a kludge to try and make up for context that is hard to capture in wordsDoes the Japanese answer "we don't have those" reflect the fact that Japanese really don't consider any words "bad" Or does it reflect that they don't want to be involved by proxy in any contexts that call for those wordsWouldn't it be more accurate to say that a word like てめえ is a curse word, and that it's default implication is bad, and that context can make it less threatening In other words, it's not that its definition ranges from "motherfucker" to "you", it's that it means approximately "motherfucker", but given the right context it is made acceptable, just like "motherfucker" in English.Please no overly technical linguistic terminology so that answers are understandable for everyone. Thanks!
One of the most useful turns of phrase in Japanese is  ありがた迷惑{めいわく}, which is that of being helpful in a way that is not helpful. It can cover situations where one is being helpful to semi-deliberately cause guilt (Hi mom!), or situations where the helper is sincere but causing more harm than good.For a long time I pronounced it as ありがたい　めいわく, because I assume it was a combination of "grateful" and "troublesome".Since learning the correct way of saying it, I've always wondered, why is there no い at the end of ありがた
I was wondering whether the differences in Japanese vocabulary between the dialects extend even so far as particles.Are there dialects that pronounce any of the standard particles differently Especially the grammatical (syntactic) ones like は (wa), が (ga), and を (wo) Or do some dialects go so far as having extra particles or not using some of the standard particlesI'm expecting if it occurs at all it would be in Okinawan/Ryukyuan since the speech there is classed as separate language(s) as often as dialect(s) of Japanese. But I have been surprised before!

There were a lot of great answers here. I gave the checkmark to ento's answer because I felt it most completely explained all aspects of this use of こと. But many of the other answers are excellent, so if you're visiting this question for the first time, please take a few moments to read through all answers. Thanks to everyone for your help with this question.When learning the phrase "I like X", everyone learns "Xが好きだ". But if X is a pronoun, you sometimes see こと:あなたが好きだ。　→　あなたのことが好きだ。What purpose does こと serve here I know that in subordinate clauses, こと can eliminate ambiguity:彼が好きな人 "a person he likes" or "a person who likes him"彼のことが好きな人 "a person who likes him"But in a simple statement such as the first example above, it doesn't seem to change the meaning at all.My own searches on this problem have yielded the following two theories (neither with anything to back them up):こと adds a layer of indirectness, and is therefore preferred from a Japanese standpoint.こと encompasses more of the object ("you" versus "all the things about you")Is either of these correctこと also shows up in many other situations, seemingly without any effect on the meaning:事件を覚えている。　→　事件のことを覚えている。 I remember the incident.地球を考えて行動する　→　地球のことを考えて行動する take action while considering the Earth planet (edited to "the planet" to fulfill the requirement for 考える to be paired with something abstract)What's going on here

According to dictionaries, 「けど」 means ‘but’, ‘although’, ‘however’.However, it seems to have slightly another meaning at the end of the sentence. For example, here are few example sentences with their approximate translations (correct me if I'm wrong):「まあ、いいけど。」 — ‘I guess, it's okay.’「お話があるのですけど」 — ‘I have something to tell you’「セーターが欲しいんだけど」 — ‘I'm looking for a sweater’Translations demonstrate that「けど」 introduces some uncertainty, but don't feature anything close to ‘but’ or ‘however’.Can anyone clarify how the meaning of 「けど」 at the end of sentence can be expressed in English, when it's appropriate to use this word, and what's it ‘politeness level’
In all the anime and j-drama I have watched all these years, as far as I can remember, the only scenario where the greeting 「ごめんください」 is used is when the characters are in front of an ajar or open door of a house calling the residents out, like 「ごめんください! だれかいませんか」. I also remember some scenes where this greeting was used in phone calls, although I can't recall whether it was in the beginning or before the end of the conversations.Apart from the two scenarios above, are there any other scenarios where 「ごめんください」 is used If not, what makes this greeting so restricted in usageN.B. Somewhat related: Usage of すみません (sumimasen) versus ごめんなさい (gomen'nasai)
Warning: We're all adults here, but just in case, this question may contain words, in both Japanese and English, that some may not like to read.A long time ago, when I was working with a translator, a native Japanese speaker, the term 気違い{きちがい} ("insane person") came up. She told me it was one of the worst insults one can use. So bad, in fact, that you wouldn't hear it on television.I wasn't clear to me then, or now, if she meant that as her opinion, hyperbole to express how bad the word is, or that there really are some guidelines or rules about words that can be uttered on television.In any case, I took it to mean that 気違い{きちがい} is much more offensive than, say 「この野郎{やろう}！」, which means "You asshole!"... maybe.Then, a little while ago, I'm reading a Tintin book, タンタンの冒険{ぼうけん} - 青{あお}い蓮{はす} (The Adventures of Tintin - The Blue Lotus), and on page 13, when Tintin is running away from a sword weilding madman on drugs, he yells 「きちがいだ！」Since this is a book for young readers, I guess my impression of 気違い{きちがい} is wrong...First question is, just how bad is 気違い{きちがい}Second question, is there a list of words considered too bad for television (If so, references please, lets not just speculate.)(Please no overly technical linguistic terms. Thanks!)

I maintain a flashcards app (called AnkiDroid), it is open source so various users contributed the Japanese UI localization.Unfortunately, for the term "flashcards deck" (a file containing a number of cards about a particular topic), there seems to be two schools of thought: Some are using デッキ while others are using 単語帳.For the sake of consistency, I must choose one, but I have no idea which is better.Which one would you keep
I think we all are familiar with する verbs, which are verbs that are formed by appending する to nouns. Examples include 勉強する, 愛する etc. This pattern is very convenient because it can be appended to almost anything, such as ライクする (to 'Like' a Facebook post).There is another common verbification pattern, which is the つく verbs. Examples include 嘘つく, 傷つく etc. However, unlike する which simply means "to do", つく has a lots of meanings and kanji characters. When I queried in WWWJDIC, つく has at least 8 variants, including but not limited to 付く, 就く, 点く, 突く, 着く etc. While I observe many of these verbs are made of 付く, there are some that are made of different variants like 落着く {おちつく} and 楯突く {たてつく}, and some even have multiple variants, for example うそつく can be written as both 嘘付く and 嘘吐く. How do we tell (apart from referring to a dictionary of course) which つく that made up a particular つく verb, for example むかつくThere is also a question on particles on the extended verb phrase. For example, while 傷つく is 傷をつく and 嘘つく is 嘘をつく, 気づく is actually 気がつく. What about, again, むかつく Is it むかをつく or むかがつく In a Google search, I even saw むかとつく. So, in general, how do we actually tell which particle is used in a particular verb

I'm a bit confused regarding the choice between the 加 and 増 kanji for any meaning related to "adding one thing to another".I assume that, as usual, the suru-verb combination 増加する is somewhat more formal than either of the other options.I was told that 増 was for adding more of the same thing, while 加 might be used for adding things of a different type, but examples that I have found don't seem to match with that idea. For example, my dictionary has the following at the start of an example sentence...汽車がスピードをだんだん加えていき。。。There's also 殖える, which seems to replace 増 in cases explicitly related to population (people, livestock, or grain), but it seems to be used for something like "net worth" as well.There's also 足す, which I believe has a connotation similar to 足りる in meaning "add enough to suffice".

Like a lot of foreign guys, some Japanese I picked up from imitating the women I spoke to. Certain affectations made me sound unwittingly effeminate in the early days when I had less grasp on the impression my words made.One of those habits was to use でしょう at the end of sentences, to express uncertainty, asking confirmation, or wondering aloud.Later on I was told that it was more masculine to use だろう. Even though that was years ago, I never really got comfortable with だろう. I'm not sure I'm using it right, and it feels weird saying it.I'm hoping JL&amp;U can come to the rescue here.First, is だろう really the more masculine form of でしょう It seems sometimes I do hear men using でしょう, and women using だろう. Do they mean different thingsSecond, are だろ and だろう differentLastly, what is the difference between these two statements:何かあったのだろうか。何かあったと思う。

I have found a kanji in a manga I am attempting to read, that looks like this:I have tried to find it in numerous dictionaries, and used multiple different methods. I know the third section is a radical, but the first isn't, and searching the third on it's own at WWWJDIC returns many results, but none of them are this one. Skip code has also been unfruitful. Handwriting has been challenging, because I'm not 100% certain on the order.A friend suggested that it may be a kanji that is out of use, but used because the manga author thinks it's cool. I doubt it's slang, though, due to the context of being a formal statement.The context is: 我輩はノイ＝クレザント()騎士である where the () is the character. It was written vertically.I have stated the question as "How do I look up this kanji" because I suspect I may get into this situation again.Edit: The answer I have marked as correct actually contains the answer in the comments, so I've written it up here. It is actually a Google Chrome character font problem. The character did really appear in the dictionaries, but I couldn't recognise it because it was displayed incorrectly (Chinese instead of Japanese). Chrome doesn't check all the fonts on your computer like IE or FF, so I changed the standard fonts and it worked.

Here's another habitual mistake I make. I'm looking at a sign for a restaurant with pictures of great food. So I remark to my friend:美味{おい}しいそう、ね？... intending to mean, "that looks good, don't you think" (more literally: "[that] seems delicious, huh"). I'm going to make "good" synonymous with "delicious" for 美味{おい}しい in this question, by the way, because it's more natural for me to say food is "good".My friend laughs, though, and tells me that by using そう in this case, I'm saying that I've heard or been informed that it is good. It does not mean that I am directly assessing the picture for myself in that moment.Yet, when I look up in the dictionary, one of the definitions of そう is "seems" or "looks like". There's no mention of hearsay.I've also looked at some related questions on this site, but I'm still left confused. In the answer to that question, it says "そう emphasizes evidence of the senses rather than general seeming." Well... if that's true, then shouldn't my eyes looking at the picture be the evidence of the sense I need to justify using そうFirst, what should I say if I want to say "that looks good" 「美味{おい}しいみたい」 That seems like I am saying that the presentation might be deceptive, as in "that might be good, but that's just the way the picture is, and who knows about the real thing." 「美味{おい}しいかな」 That makes it sound like I'm seeking confirmation, as in "I wonder if that's good" 「美味{おい}しいだろ」 That sounds to me like I'm asking the question "does that look good"Second, I feel like I hear Japanese around me saying 「美味{おい}しいそう」 all the time. If it involves some hearsay, then is it only used as a confirmation after someone has made a previous statement Like so:昨日{きのう}、めちゃうまいビーガン店{みせ}に行った！　("Yesterday I went to an  insanely awesome vegan restaurant!")美味{おい}しいそう！私{わたし}も行{い}きたい！　 ("That sounds good!

This is a mistake I habitually make, even though I know what the right form is.Earlier tonight, I wanted to tell my friend "Let's go together!", so I sent a mail saying:一緒{いっしょ}で行{い}こう！My friend sent back a mail :はい、一緒{いっしょ}に行{い}こう ;)... reminding me that で is incorrect, and に is the appropriate particle in this case.Which I know is right, but the reason it's stuck in my head to use で is that it makes more sense to me.に is used to indicate direction of action(), so I don't see how "going" can be directed at "together".で makes sense to me, because my understanding of で is that it means "by use of" or "by way of" or something like that.So to me it makes perfect sense to say 一緒{いっしょ}で行{い}こう because with で it means "let's go, and the way we'll go is together".Can someone help me break this habit by making some kind of logical sense of why に is right and で isn't

In a grammar textbook I have, there is this phrase:幸{さいわ}い日本{にほん}で日本語{にほんご}を勉強{べんきょう}して、かなり話{はな}せるようになりました。日本{にほん}に行{い}っただけのことはありました。The translation given is:Fortunately, I studied Japanese in Japan and now I can speak it fairly  well. I didn't go to Japan for nothing.The thing that confuses me is in that last part, where the translation is "I didn't go to Japan for nothing".It seems to me that だけのことがありました literally translates to something like "there was just that thing". だけ, to me, implies exclusion of other things.So to me, the sentence should be something like "That's all I went to Japan for", or perhaps "That's all I got from being in Japan". The way I read it has more of a negative implication than the given translation.What am I not understanding about this phrase in order to see how the given translation makes sense Or perhaps is the given translation not as good as it could be
As a foreigner in Japan, one has to get used to the fact that some Japanese will compliment you on things that are too mundane to really deserve mention. Like the fact that you can use chopsticks, eat sushi, say 「今日は」, and all that sort of thing.Most of the time, it's harmless, and a mere stepping stone to genuine conversation.But sometimes you'll meet that person who will just go on about it for a bit too long. They'll ask follow up questions, and keep the topic alive, blocking the potential to interact as more than just a gaijin novelty.To those people, I want to say, "yeah, look, can we get past that" Well... that would be the politer version (though obviously not devoid of a little frustration). Sometimes I just want to say "Get over it, will ya"I think the more or less literal translation for "get over it" would be:[乗り切って]【のりきって】First question is: Is that a suitable translation, or is it too literal in the sense of physically crossing somethingNext question: How would I, and could I, differentiate between "Get over it" (slightly stronger and a little more confrontational) and "can we get past this" (a little softer but still conveying some annoyance).Additional note 1: I'm okay with being a little confrontational on this, so please don't hold back on potentially stern suggestions for translation.IMPORTANt: This is a language question about how to express a concept, this is not a question about how to socially handle an interaction. Answers should be about how to express the idea of "get over it" in the Japanese language. Answers about how you would come up with different responses or how you handle the given examples are off topic.
If I've understood correctly, ちょうど followed by a counting word usually means something like "just x" or "exactly x" depending on the context, but I can't figure out what it means in this opening sentence of a novel:バルサが鳥影橋をわたっていたとき、皇族の行列が、ちょうど一本上流の山影橋にさしかかっていたことが、バルサの運命をかえた。I understand the overall meaning of the sentence, but the exact purpose of ちょうど一本 here eludes me.

When learning Japanese everyone's taught いる is for a living thing and ある is for non-living things. However, I recently saw the following sentence ...あと、サッカー選手でもあります。... which ends in ある / あります for a living subject, assuming were not talking about a dead soccer player!Now the following make uses of ある sense to me:〜である  〜がある  〜にあるBut in my mind these adhere to the living/dead rule learned in those first Nihongo classes all those years ago. So where does もあります fit in How should I think of this in English (equivalent phrase)
Descriptions of Japanese phonology (such as Wikipedia's) usually describe high vowels between voiceless consonants (or word-finally) as "devoiced". For example, the pronunciation of ⟨圧⟩ 'pressure' and ⟨悲観⟩ 'pessimism' are described as:/aꜜtu/ → [átsu̥]/hikaɴ/ → [çi̥kãɴ́]But it often sounds to me like the supposedly devoiced vowel is actually dropped, with the preceding consonant expanding to fill 1 mora's time. Similarly, I have seen word-final devoiced vowels dropped in written pronunciations, such as "/desu/ → [des]" rather than "→ [desu̥]". In this analysis, the pronunciations would be/aꜜtu/ → [áts] or [áts̩] or [átsː]/hikaɴ/ → [ç̩kãɴ́] or [çːkãɴ́]Which of these better describes the actual contemporary Japanese pronunciation (Further, does this vary by dialect or speech register)(Related to What are the rules regarding "mute vowels" ("u" after "s" and "i" after "sh").)
I often see adverbs used in one of three ways:1) Adverb appears in isolation in a sentence:あまり 好きじゃないんですが。2) Adverb is followed by に別々に お願いします。1970年代後半、多くの罪もない日本の一般市民が 次々に 失踪した。3) Adverb is followed by と鮮明な花火が夜空に 次々と 揚がった。Notice that in 2b), and 3), it's even the same adverb and the meaning appears identical.  So suppose for a minute we wrote sentence 3) in each of the three different ways:鮮明な花火が夜空に 次々 揚がった。鮮明な花火が夜空に 次々に 揚がった。鮮明な花火が夜空に 次々と 揚がった。Is there any difference between theseI suspect that the first one is wrong, but the second two are identical and both correct.  But I don't know what rule governs this.  And I think (although I don't have an example handy) that the first ( adv only) and second ( adv + に) patterns can also be used interchangeably in certain situations, which would suggest that maybe all 3 can be used interchangeably in some situations, but not others.Can anyone explain how this works
Do you keep a list of set phrases that you use often, or phrases that you'd use someday I do. Here's mine, a list of phrases I've collected from work emails since three years ago.Such a list, while seldom shared, can help us learn useful phrases from real world examples.If you care to share, great! Please post your list as an answer, or a link to your list if it's more than a few. Also please add a word or two about its usage context. Something along the line of:Example &gt; My list of conversation openers (childcare industry)Most used:おはようさぎ... - Morning rabbitこんばんわに... - G'night alligatorNote to future readers: those lists should tend to be void of actual context. If you're unsure about its usage, it's a good idea to post a question about it!Suggestions welcome if this question itself needs reframing.
When is it appropriate to put さ at the end of a sentence Do women say this also I think I remember seeing a female character say it in an anime.
Is there any rules that govern when to use 不 and 非 and 無 and 未 in regards to the meaning of "not" or "un-"for instance 非表示, 不満
Last summer my family hosted a Japanese exchange student for two weeks, and we've kept in touch with her a lot. Unfortunately, about 2 months ago I found out she had Leukemia. She said she'll recover...but it'll take a long time (6 months according to her)I know Japanese at an intermediate level, so it strikes me as odd I've never picked up the phrase "Get well soon". We're sending her a bunch of gifts and a card (and my family knows I'm the only one with any knowledge of Japanese), so they put it on me to write what goes inside of it.Please help me not screw this up =x She's 16 turning 17 soon if that makes a big difference.
This question has 2 parts.Why is it that ああ has so many different kanji 嗚呼; 於乎; 於戯; 嗟乎; 嗟夫; 吁; 嗟; 噫; 鳴呼 (source)and is the average japanese (16 yr old and above) able to recognize them all
Why is it that the っけ suffix / け particle (indicating that the speaker is trying to recall some information) can only be attached to a sentence when the sentence itself is a question-sentenceBecause all 10 example usages i see in WWWJDIC does that, hence the question.
This sentence was in a grammar textbook:彼{かれ}は同僚{どうりょう}にライバル意識{いしき}、ひいては殺意{さつい}すら抱いていた... it means:"He regarded his colleague as a rival, even to the point of  considering murder."My question is about the last kanji, 抱. It seems to have three readings, だ・く, いだ・く, and うだ・く, though I think the last one might be rare.So far as I can tell, they all carry exactly the same definition, which is "to hold, to embrace, to carry", which can be meant both in the physical sense of actually holding something, as well as the metaphorical sense of holding onto a feeling, like a grudge. (So I would assume the translation above, which isn't mine, took the liberty of changing "harbouring intentions of murder" into "considering murder".)Is there a way I can determine which reading is the right one Unless I'm mistaken, they all conjugate with the same okurigana, so I can't use the trailing hiragana as any kind of indicator.Is there any difference in implied meaning or usage between the readingsAlso, slight bonus question... My understanding is that the だ・く reading can be used as a slang way of saying sex (I saw it used that way in a TV show once). Is that true, what would be the nuances it carries, and is it also true for the other readingsLastly: As is always my preference, please keep answers readable for all, with either no technical linguistic terminology, or with linguistic terms in a separate section for those who want it. Thanks!
When I learnt this grammar point a while ago, my teachers told me not to use it with "から". There reasoning for this was that のだ already implies a reason or supporting information for a conclusion.Even reading through the answers for "What connotation does なんだ add", it appears のだ is contrasted with から.However, I see and hear this construction (んだから）all the time. It doesn't seem very rare at all, which leaves me confused as to why my native Japanese teachers told me that it was incorrect in the first place.I'll use the first result from Google as the example.お兄ちゃんのことがぜんぜんすきじゃないんだからねっ！！This is a title for a movie. However, how would this be different if the title had have been:お兄ちゃんのことがぜんぜんすきじゃないんだっ！！If のだ is used as a way to indicate reason, then why is から also included When would it be correct to use のだから instead of のだ
When using あまり in the sense of "too much" (as opposed to "not very"), until recently I had always seen it as あまりにもA, with A being the thing that there was too much of.  I never really tried to relate the meaning of individual particles に and も to the word あまり and try to understand how it takes on the meaning of "too much", I just accept it as a set expression.  Here is an example of this usage:あの本はあまりにも面白かったので、読むのに夢中になっていたら、いつの間にか夜が明けていた。Recently I saw it used as &lt;N&gt;のあまり and &lt;V-dict&gt;あまり with seemingly identical meaning.  Examples:母は、私を心配するあまり、体調を崩したようです。その犬が死んだ時、先生は悲しみのあまり、しばらく仕事を休んでいました。Is this the same usage of あまり  Could I simply switch to the other pattern in all 3 of the above examplesあの本は面白かったあまり、読むのに夢中になっていたら、いつの間にか夜が明けていた。母は、私をあまりにも心配して、体調を崩したようです。その犬が死んだ時、先生はあまりにも悲しみ、しばらく仕事を休んでいました。Is there any difference in nuance here, or perhaps is something flat out wrong  Also, is there any context in which あまり can be used with に or は such as あまりに or あまりは  If so, what is the meaning in this case  Maybe someone could construct an example sentence with translation using あまりに and/or あまりは, if it makes sense.
Recently I learned of a new way to express potential form.  Here's a few example sentences:今回は予測し得ないことが起きたけど、皆、落ち着いていた。自分の意見を自由に言えないなんて、普通の国ではあり得ない。The second example I put for contrast, because it illustrates one obvious difference which is that I don't think potential forms of ある and いる exist.In the first example, however, it's not so clear.  Instinctually, from looking at these and a few other examples, I think perhaps there is a sense of impossibility here that is not present in simple できる or ～られる form, but I have trouble articulating it, and it may be a red herring anyway.For example, change the first sentence to this:今回は予測できないことが起きたけど、皆、落ち着いていた。Does it have a different nuance nowCan someone elaborate on the differences between these two constructs
Just wondering If choosing a reading is as simple as whether 得る is a suffix.This is from tatoeba.org, a wiki-like sentence mine, so I'm not sure if える, the reading entered is correct.彼はとてもよく訓練された役者だけが本当に成功し得ると思っている。  He thinks that only very well trained actors can be really successful.
Specifically, in the expression 好きなんだ (I love you) why not just say 好きだ or 好きです
Every now and then I hear 待ちに待った, as in:待ちに待ったライブ a long-awaited concertI started wondering if this pattern can apply to other verbs, and it certainly seems to, if Google is any indication. I found instances of 望みに望んだ, 祈りに祈った, and even things like 飲みに飲んだ.Question A: Can I use this pattern with any verb showing intent Is there a particular nuance behind it, or does it simply mean "to [verb] and then [verb] some more"Question B: For the linguists in the room (y'all know who you are), how is the に classified in this pattern Is it the same に as in 買いに行く
There are at the very least several i-adjectives can be used as na-adjectives by dropping the final い and adding な in its place. The most common examples of this, as far as I am aware, are 大きい and 小さい, which become 大きな and 小さな, respectively. For quite a while, these were the only examples I was aware of, and so I was able to accept them as just "an exception to the rule." However, as I was just watching an anime, I came across おかしな, which I'd not heard previously.Update. Ignacio Vazquez-Abrams pointed out in a comment that 暖かい can also be used in this way (i.e. 暖かな). I guess that means I have to take back my claim that only the three above can be used as na-adjectives. I will continue to search.Update 3. It's been quite a while since I originally asked this question, and it appears that in the interim, dainichi has found two more instances of where this is possible. Specifically, やわらかい → やわらかな and 細【こま】かい → 細【こま】かな. So maybe there are some criteria to determine which adjectives can be used in this way, after all.In the interest of getting a definitive answer, I've decided to offer a bounty on this question. The best answer will address the following points fully, with sources cited where possible (academic research or dictionary entries / grammar resources are preferred):It has been suggested that the ～な usage adds a higher level of subjectivity; is confirmation of this assertion availableWe have determined a list currently of six adjectives which can be used in this way, outlined below. Are there any other i-adjectives which can be used as na-adjectives in this mannerIs there a system or set of criteria which can be used to identify adjectives which can be used in this waya. If YES, what is that system or set of criteriab. If NO, why can this set of adjectives be used in this wayIf you would like the question to be clarified further, please leave a comment and I will be more than willing to do so if possible.Currently Identified　i→na Adjectives大【おお】きい ⇒ 大【おお】きな小【ちい】さい ⇒ 小【ちい】さなおかしい ⇒ おかしな暖【あたた】かい ⇒ 暖【あたた】かなやわらかい ⇒ やわらかな細【こま】かい ⇒ 細【こま】かなRelated question: Why does Japanese have two kinds of adjectives (-i adjectives and -na adjectives)
ユーザ or ユーザー, which is more in use or is there no differenceI see both of them in use, but is there one that is more correct than the other or is at least the prevailing standarda similar word is サーバ and サーバー.
Well if I'm not wrong, usually when a word has multiple kanjis one of them is selected as the "main" or more commonly used one.But is it true that 才 and 歳 are both the "main" kanji for さい
Can someone explain the usage of a na-adjective with the を particleI cannot understand why we can sayほうれん草を嫌いな人もいる。because I'd thought that it had to be a が or の particle instead of an を.Also, why can we sayきみがなぜジャズを嫌いか私にはわからない。Shouldn't it be きみがなぜジャズが嫌いか私にはわからない(Source: tatoeba.org)
This one stumped my Japanese friend that I was having dinner with earlier tonight. We were talking about the fact that tomorrow is Monday and I had a tough work week ahead. She said ガンバレ, I paused, and asked what was the difference between that and 頑張{がんば}って . She paused, then said I should ask someone else. Like a lot of native speakers, some word choices just come naturally and she's never examined the hows and whys.I notice just now that when I type them in, my IME's first suggestion for がんばって is in kanji, and the first suggestion for がんばれ is in katakana. Is that indicative of a difference in meaning and usage, or merely convention in writingAlso, I do know that がんばって can be followed by ください, and I think がんばれ can't. So perhaps it's just a matter of the form of the verb Still, even if that's the case, I'm wondering if there are different implications for choosing one or the other.Anyone know what the difference isPlease note: In accordance with the discussion on meta regarding linguistic terminology, I'm going to request that answers be in plain English (and Japanese) so that everyone can understand. Or, at least, please know that I wouldn't mark an answer as correct if it only contained technical linguistic terms. Thanks for your understanding.
Generally, in all Japanese language classes, the rule you're taught is that です does not follow い adjectives.  Instead, い adjectives can act like stative verbs, and as such terminate a sentence by themselves.  However, I have heard this usage frequently.  I don't necessarily have a specific example in mind that I've heard, because it doesn't seem all that rare.  However, recently I got into a discussion with someone who suggested that い adjective + です is dangerous, and has the potential to be offensive and/or rude when used incorrectly so foreigners should avoid it.  One specific example given was 美しいです sounding vulgar.  They also said that い adjective + だ is flat out ungrammatical in all situations.  When I've posed this same question to other Japanese speakers, they take no issue with 美しいです and they say it sounds fine.My question is, there seems to be some disagreement.  Does anyone have a definitive answer about why such a disagreement might exist, and how I should go about knowing whether or not it's safe to use い adjective + です in normal usage  Or maybe people here also have no issue with it, and think that the original person I spoke to was perhaps mistaken.If it's not safe, then what do I do if I want to end a sentence with an い adjective politely  Follow it with ～のです perhaps
While studying for JLPT N2 I came across this expression の折に.  It appears to be almost identical to の時に.  My reference suggests that it's basically the same, but simply less polite.  What I find suspicious is that I've been studying Japanese for quite a number of years, and I have never seen or heard of this until now, and dictionaries such as アルク suggest that it is not very common.Is there a difference in meaning / nuance  Is it actually common and I've just been blind all this time  (I wonder why it's not taught in any normal textbook / Japanese course in that case).  Should I avoid itI would appreciate if anyone can shed some light onto the usage.
I think a graded anthology of haiku or tanka might make an excellent chrestomathy for learning kanji and japanese.Are there any appropriately-licensed (e.g. creative commons / public domain) haiku or tanka anthologies in electronic form that could be used as the basis for thisEDIT: (in response to sawa's comments, I've added "and tanka" to this question.
Hi all I understand that つもり means "intention" like say 夏休みにはゆっくり休むつもりです。 = I intend to rest during the summer vacation.But what does 分かっているつもりだ。 meansWell if I translate directly, it seems to be "I intend to be in the know" However the translation (not by me) was "I know that."I'm just wondering how did it work out to be that way What is the significance of that つもり in that question
According to my references, both of these are used in situations where one thing happens immediately after another.  Here are some example sentences:（火事を見た人の話）ドーンという音がして、１分たつかたたないかのうちに火が出てきました。彼は、５時のベルが鳴るか鳴らないかのうちに手を止め、工場を飛び出した。（ニュース）　先ほど、関東地方で地震がありました。詳しい情報が入り次第、お伝えいたします。すみません、もう少しお待ちください。分かり次第、お知らせしますので。In all four cases, could you simply switch to the alternate construct with no change in meaning  Are there some examples where one or the other doesn't work, or perhaps a slightly different nuance between the two
What is the conceptual difference, or difference in nuance between these two constructions when used to mean 'and'  I realize there are some syntactic differences, such as や not appearing after the final item being enumerated, but as far as general nuance is concerned, is there any significant difference  For example, here's a couple sentences:1a. 怪我やらインフルエンザやらで、試合に出られない選手が多い。1b. 怪我やインフルエンザで、試合に出られない選手が多い。2a. 今日は会議やら新人研参会やらがあって無理。明日なら大丈夫だけど。2b. 今日は会議や新人研参会があって無理。明日なら大丈夫だけど。Is there any difference in meaning in these (or perhaps other) examples of usage

A Japanese person told me that they have ブラコン。I looked it up on Wikipedia and it said something like an emotional attachment to one's brother. But they said that it meant something like someone who likes rap music. I couldn't find a definition like this. Is this what it means
It might be hard to read because of the image resolution, but on the cover of this book, on the bottom left side, it says:へんな日本語にも理由がある。Which means something like:"Even strange Japanese has a reason."The thing is, 理由 has furigana above it that says it should be read わけ.わけ is not a reading for 理由. 理由 is only read りゆう, and it means "reason".Now, I already know that sometimes furigana is used to differentiate between what is said and what is meant. For example, recently in a manga I saw the kanji 妻 with the furigana ワイフ　above it. I believe this is done when the author is telling us that the character said "wife", but the kanji 妻 is provided so if the reader doesn't know what the katakana-ized English word means, they have the kanji to help.So, in a way, when the furigana and the kanji differ, it's so that the kanji provides meaning to the furigana, as opposed to furigana's usual job of providing readability to the kanji.Okay, fine... but, why わけ for 理由 Doesn't わけ also mean "meaning", "cause", and even "conclusion based on reasoning"The difference seems so subtle to me that I can't see the point of it. Yet, given that the book is all about Japanese usage, I imagine the author is quite particular about words, so surely there's a purpose.What is that purpose(Side note: I intend to buy the book, so maybe an explanation is within its covers. But I hope this still merits some discussion.)
Today, while looking up random words in WWWJDIC, I stumbled upon an example sentence for the word いとしい as below:少女は人形をいとしげに抱き締めた。 The girl squeezed her doll affectionately.The sentence uses ~げに adjective suffix that I have never seen before. Based from the above translation, it seems to convert the adjective into adverb, just like what ~く does. Also, a quick check with Google showed that can also follow a noun, e.g. 自慢げに.What is this suffix actually and how is it different from ~く form As I mentioned in previous paragraph this is the first time I've seen it so I am not even sure is it standard Japanese or a slang or whatnot.
I see 情弱乙 being used (as an interjection) on many websites, but I can't find it in any dictionary, even online dictionaries. I guess the pronunciation is じょうじゃくおつ. What does it meanExamples:情弱乙！ガラケーｗｗｗ情弱乙ｗｗｗ情弱乙と呼ばれないために
I came across a sentence using もあれば where there wasn't a conditional. あれば got translated as sometimes:名詞から動詞が派生していることもあれば、その逆のこともある。  Sometimes a verb is derived from a noun and sometimes it is the other way around.Looking for more examples, I saw some more sentences with this "sometimes this, sometimes that" pattern. I basically understand how to construct a sentence with this pattern, but I also found some where I couldn't' tell what もあれば was doing:京都から高野山までは、3時間もあれば行ける距離です。  Kyoto is about 3 hours distance from Mt. Koya  10分もあれば支度できます。  It only takes me 10 minutes to get readyWhat is もあれば's function in the last two examples
I can't find this defined anywhere.Here's an example:タオルケットをちょちょいかけにきてくれる。I am also interested in what this whole sentence says.
絶対{ぜったい}領域{りょういき} is a slang term that refers to the visible bare skin from the bottom of a woman's skirt to the top of her thigh high stockings. Or, short pants and thigh high boots... pick your preferred style. The point is that it's the exposed part of the thigh.That's the meaning, but where did it come fromDirectly translated, it means "absolute territory". The territory part I get - it's an area on the body. But "absolute"　I find that hard to parse. Other meanings for 絶対{ぜったい} are "unconditional" or "unmistakable", but regardless of the translation choice, I find them all odd choices. Why 絶対{ぜったい}"Absolutely" sexy or "unmistakably" sexy perhapsLastly, is this term regulated to otaku types who are into anime, or is it in common use
I can see that someone got mad or someone made someone else mad. The things that make it difficult are に and the られる form of 怒る. What does this mean How do you figure out who did what in these types of sentences

Let's have some fun with particles! Create a sentence using as many particles as you can. Rules:The sentence can combine any number of clauses or ideas but it must be meaningful (i.e. no gibberish) and should be using standard Japanese (i.e. no slang).Each entry will be given a score based on how many unique usages of particles; 1 point per particle. No point is given to repeated particles unless they are used for different roles, for example using one から for denoting reason and another for denoting origin of movement give 2 points. Please count the score and include it in your entry (also recommended if you can bold/highlight the particles that you count).Compound particles (では, でも, のに etc) are considered different particles from their atomic particles as long as their roles are clearly distinct from the latter. A counter-example would be something like "X からの Y" where the からの is simply から + の particles.Sentences that simply list down all the particles do not qualify as "meaningful".One entry per answer, please.NB: Dear moderators, please make this into CW. On whether this kind of question is allowable or not, please discuss in this meta discussion. To all, let's refrain from voting up/down in here until this becomes CW, just to not disturb the rep points ;)
I always read 降る as ふる but for a particular sentence I noticed that the reading was written as くだる. Are there any tips to help figure out which reading to useExamples: たとえ雨が降ろうとサイクリングにいくぞ。  I will go cycling even if it rains. [M]  目が覚めてみると、雪が降っていた。  I awoke to find it snowing.I'm not sure if this is user-error. When I click on listen, the woman reads it using ふる, but the software wants me to use くだる. Maybe I should change the question to ask what I should say in my bug report ☺
How do we tell whether 2 hiragana should fit in 1 "mora" or 2For example, why is it that 四季 and 士気 are pronounced as "Shiki" 1 mora, whereas 式 and 指揮 are pronounced as "Shi Ki" 2 morae N.B. Links bring to a dictionary.What I meant is that according to the audio files I've linked to in the question, there is a significant difference in the "gap" between the two hiragana. Why is it that although 式 and 四季 have the same hiragana (しき), 式 has both the clear sounds of "shi" and "ki" (2 distinct "sounds") whereas in 四季 the し and き are slurred to form a single "sound"
I saw an colleague's email asking for a few days of vacation, and I was surprised by the ultra-polite level. This colleague is usually on relatively casual terms with the boss, so it was quite unexpected. Selected extracts:以下の日程で有給休暇を取得したく申請いたします。PMのXXXさんに許可をいただいております。以上、よろしくお願いいたします。Is it usual for Japanese people to add an extra level of politeness when asking for holidaysI feel I will sound hypocrite if I do the same.Japanese company, I am the only foreigner.
In two conjunctions 「ところで」 and 「ところが」 that mean "by the way / incidentally" and "however / nevertheless" respectively, what is the significance of the word 「ところ」 How does ところ + で give the nuance of "this is an extra information", while ところ + が give the nuance of "this is contrary to the fact"What is the place referred by ところ in both conjunctions
I've seen several translations of the following song lyrics from Lady Gaga's "Edge of Glory" online, and none of them look quite right.I'm on the edge, the edge, the edge, the edge, the edge, the edge, the edge,I'm on the edge of glory, and I'm hanging on a moment with you I'm on the edge with you. Here's an example果てに私が果てに果てに、果てに果てに、果てに果てに栄光の果てに私がいるのあなたといる瞬間にしがみついてる果てにあなたと私が一緒にいるのAfter thinking about it, I realized that different Japanese words for words for "edge" have implications that don't exist in English.I think that 果て with regards to "glory", implies that glory has already been achieved. The above translation would be wrong then, since "edge of glory" means the same thing as "about to achieve glory."Are my observations correct What is the correct Japanese word for "edge" in this case
This is probably a bit of a silly question, but what do you say in Japanese when you're asking for the bill in a restaurant Or is it unusual to say anything at allWhen I was in Japan I could never really catch any particular phrases and when I was at Kaitenzushi places I just stood up until the staff noticed I was ready to leave and then they counted my plates.Would it be something to the effect of 付けをください Or is it like in America where you usually don't really ask for the bill but just wait for it to come
Do Japanese writers use underline to emphasize a point, or other techniques Wikipedia mentions the use of katakana in its article on Emphasis and in its article on Katakana, but I'm not sure whether it's appropriate.Background: I’m incorporating XKCD 386 (with the text modified) into a talk given in English with Japanese subtitles. I'm doing the cartoons side by side, and I'm wondering what the equivalent of underlining "wrong" in a western cartoon would be.

What would be appropriate expressions or idioms to convey the typical English response:What's it to you(in a sense that goes somewhere between "None of your business" and "This is not your problem")The best I can think of is あなたには関係ない. I am looking for other possibly softer, more polite ways of expressing the same idea.(as an aside, if you have less polite, more direct, I am also curious)PS: Before anybody comments: I realise that any variation on this will sound too direct and potentially rude for many situations in Japan, however softly it is formulated. But the general idea is to be trenchant, in situations which might call for it... so no need to dwell on the rudeness aspect too much.Edit: tough to pick from many overlapping (quality) answers, but in the end, I think Rey's encompassed exactly the nuance(s) I was interested in. Thanks everybody for the great suggestions!
Can "みたい" mean "want to see", or does it always mean "looks like"/"seems like"  If not, how would "want to see" be expressedSpecifically, assuming it has both uses, it would seem ambiguous to me here:なんだか違う映画みたいだなあWould that be "I want to see a somewhat different movie", or "That seems like a somewhat different movie"
In another question we established that Japanese is an agglutinating language (more here), if only in its verb system.Since it is not traditional in Japanese grammar or teaching to go into this aspect of the language most of the information must be in scholarly linguistics publications somewhere.My question is what are the "slots" used in the Japanese verb This means in which specific rigid order can the various types of suffixes be built upIf the answer for Japanese is complex a pointer to a website or publication is also a good answer.(This article on another language includes a small example comparing to Japanese for those who are not used to looking at Japanese this way. It analyses the Japanese word "tabesaserareta")
I like to read children literature in foreign languages I am learning. I usually do not have troubles picking them in european language, but I would need recommendation for Japanese.I would like a bookwith a small vocabulary (and eventually a glossary)explaining tales of ancient Japan or little zen stories or a few proverbs.easy to read aloud (with an audio CD would be perfect)a series of self-contained short stories instead of a longer one.
WWWJDIC says すっと means "quickly / all of a sudden" yet it can also mean "quietly / gently / softly"So basically I was wondering how do we tell if すっと means "quickly / all of a sudden" or "quietly / gently / softly"E.g. in this sentence: カタツムリがすっと角を出した。Does it mean:1) Gently, the snail shot out its horns.2) All of a sudden, the snail shot out its horns.3) both 1) and 2)
So there are several ways to express something is "seemingly not ～":～なさそう～そうにない～そうもない～そうにもない (is this one even real)I was always taught ～なさそう in my Japanese classes, and it was not until I heard one of the other ones that I ever become confused about them.After doing a little research on this, it seems that adjectives can only take ～なさそう. ex.○ 料理がおいしくなさそう  ？／×　料理がおいしそうにないbut that verbs can take any of the forms○ 雨が　降らなさそう／降りそう（に・も・にも？）ないSo, my questions are a) is the above reasoning correct, and b) what are the differences/nuances of the latter three forms  Someone please set me straight on this; it's been bugging me for a couple years.

I'm translating a song which can be seen here. At the end of the song is this:傷つけてしまう夜もあるだろう 分かち合えない想いもあるだろうWhat is the subject of 傷つけてしまう夜もあるだろう Is the singer saying, "there may be nights where we'll end up hurting each other," or is he saying, "there may be nights where I'll end up hurting you"
My basic understanding of より to compare things or ending letters, is failing me when there's a で or での in front of it.As I write this, I'm wondering, can read でより as "with, more", "in, more"さらに低い給料でより多くの責任を引き受ける  accept more responsibilities for less moneyその地域でより快適なインターネット接続が可能になる  provide the area with a better Internet connectionより安い賃金でより長く働く  to work longer hours for less moneyみんなでより良い地球を創っていけるでしょう。  together we can create a better world.でのより is really tripping me up.

In many beginning Japanese classes, 来る【くる】 and 行く【いく】 are presented as "to come" and "to go," respectively. Dictionaries generally also define them this way. However, every once in a while in more advanced classes, teachers will mention that this is not actually the case; these words are used differently in Japanese than their English (pseudo-)counterparts.I cannot for the life of me remember the proper way to understand the differentiation between these verbs, past "come" and "go," a fact which is most embarassing.Can someone please explain how these words are different than the English "come" and "go" in their usageRelated question: Difference between -ていく and -てくる
All of the following words and kanji (and a few more obscure ones) seem to be used in Japanese, to describe a bird that is translated by "Phoenix" in English:不死鳥【ふしちょう】鳳凰【ほうおう】鳳【おおとり】/鵬【おおとり】フェニックスand even:火の鳥 (thought this one seems to be more of an attempt at a description than a word used on its own)不死鳥 is rather self-explanatory ("bird that doesn't die"), 鳳凰 is used in the name of the famous "phoenix hall" (鳳凰堂【ほうおうどう】) at the Byodoin (平等院【びょうどういん】) temple in Uji near Kyoto and, to my surprise, the katakana word does not refer only to the city, but also the bird.It seems clear that there might be some entanglement between different mythical creatures (some Western, some Asian) that share some properties (immortality, relation with fire etc)...Could anybody draw a clear taxonomy of all these birds and the relations between these Japanese names for me
The word 【くら】 can be written with any of the kanji 蔵, 倉, or 庫. However, WWWJDIC lists them all under one entry, defined as:(n) warehouse; cellar; magazine; granary; godown; depository; treasury; elevator;Is there a difference in nuance or usage between these three kanji, and if so, whatUpdate: @istrasci points out that:[When] 蔵 is used as【〜ぞう】in compounds, it's used to denote ownership or possession.Whereas compounds with 庫 seem to refer more to a physical storage facility.Does anybody know about different nuances of the word 【くら】 itself
Both 知る and わかる get used for "know", "understand", "learn", "find out", and various other concepts.

An English website wrote an apology in Japanese after it took down an image of cracked hinomaru (日の丸) — the hinomaru linked to a donation page for the disasters following the March 11 earthquakes.It read: 我々が 起こした偉大な犯罪の謝罪 (われわれが　おこした　いだいな　はんざいの　しゃざい)　I understand the meaning, but I don't really get how this sentence works.It's really tricky for me because no one explicitly apologizes, or there is no actual apologizing here. Is something like です dropped, or する If a です is dropped, I see that as saying they are the apology...is that a valid way to apologizeAnd is 偉大な犯罪 strange in this context I thought 偉大 was more along the lines magnificence rather than greatness in terms of magnitude.

Feel free to participate to the meta-discussion on whether this type of question (relying on buddhist terms) should be allowed on JLU.A while back, looking at a reproduction of some famous zen buddhist scrolls in a nearby Kyoto temple, I was somewhat surprised to see that the  quintessential notion of "void, emptiness" is represented by '空', rather than '無', to which my eminently non-scholar mind always gave a more spiritual overtone (beyond its everyday prosaic use).A typical example would be the common sentence:色即是空【しきそくぜくう】→ "form is emptiness, matter is void"Can anybody better versed in Japanese and/or buddhist terms explain to me the nuances in meaning between these two kanji/words in a religious context Are there other cases where "void, emptiness" would be translated with '無' in a buddhist contextEdit: to give a famous example of why '無' would seem a good candidate for the same concept, Yasujiro Ozu's grave in Kamakura famously bears nothing but the kanji '無', ostensibly standing for the buddhist concept of 'nothingness'.
The title of a manga I'm slowly working through is 惑星のさみだれ, but there is furigana above the two kanji that says ほし (star) instead. Why did it use both kanji, which seems to be normally read as わくせい (planet) when it could have used just 星 on it's own

One friend of mine told me when she was living in Japan, she liked to end her sentences with ん (maybe instead of の).Examples:明日学校にいくん？明日学校に行かないと思う…風邪引いたん。Actually I've never seen it! But my friend told me they used it!I just want to know if it's possible. And if Japanese would think it a little strange if I said ん instead of の.
I think that the both of them mean before, but I have seen that they are sometimes use in parent-child metaphors, but I always get confused with these. Some examples of ○○先、○○元 words would be appreciated.どうぞよろしくお願いします。
I'm trying to understand the following three lines from a song:ただ会いたくて 声も無くしそうででも会えなくて 夢さえ恨んだ日々薄れてく 記憶を手探りで 感触をただ愛したEach line is progressively difficult to understand. I can read the words but can't make sense of it. No translation I've found makes sense.In the first line it says something like "I seemed to lose even my voice from just wanting to meet you." I don't get how wanting to meet someone would cause someone to lose their voice. Is this a metaphorThe second line says something like, "But I couldn't meet you so I hated dreams." I don't see the connection. Another metaphor, or is this one of those cases where the native Japanese is able to easily fill in the blanksThe third line is the weirdest one of all.Can anyone make sense of thisThe complete song lyrics are here.

わがままはもう言わない gets translated as "won't say anything selfish anymore." However, this doesn't really make sense. If I google "say anything selfish," what I find are sites that have translated わがままはもう言わない into English. It's not a phrase that is normally used in English and the phrase itself doesn't even seem to really make sense. I don't think that English speakers really understand what わがまま is since they always translate it directly into something that is grammatically correct but doesn't really make sense.So what does わがままはもう言わない actually meanCan someone give some example sentences that exhibit わがまま
In the Japanese version of "don't drink and drive" slogan, 【乗るなら飲むな】 (also 【飲んだら乗るな】), what part of speech is the な that follows the plain verb 飲む (or 乗る in the second variation) to form the negative imperative verb form At first I thought it was a conjugation, but a conjugation modifies the verb that it attaches to, whereas 飲む and 乗る are left unmodified before the な. I am thinking maybe it is a special usage of the な particle, but I don't discount the possibility that it is entirely a different species. Also, what of its origin Did it come from abbreviation of longer clauses like 「飲む無しに(して/しろ)」 etc, or from something else

This question already has answers here:                                            What is the difference between all the weather words: 気象{きしょう}, 天気{てんき} and 天候{てんこう}                                (2 answers)                            Closed 5 years ago.What's the real difference between 天気 and 天候  In at least one of my dictionaries, 天候 just redirects to 天気.I've always thought (read: "felt") that 天候 is the general "concept" of weather, or even climate秋の天候 - "the [type of] weather in the fall"; 北海道の天候 - "the climate of Hokkaido"whereas 天気 seems to be the actual tangible weather.明日の天気は雨です - "Tomorrow (the actual weather) will be rain"; 天気予報 - "weather (not climate) forecast"これ合ってるか教えてください。EDIT:  After looking a bit more through the different definitions, it seems that 気候 is more closely related to "climate" than 天候.
In one of the Japanese classes I attended, I've been taught that while we use 「何も出来ない」to say "He cannot do anything", to say "He can do anything" we use 「何でも出来る」 instead of 「何も出来る」.Why is there a grammar rule that says 「何も」 is used before negative predicate while 「何でも」 is used before positive predicate Why do we need additional で particle for the positive predicateIs the rule still being followed, and are there any exceptions (something like exceptions to the 全然+negative rule)
I understand the grammar point "Verb (Dictionary Form) + ことはない" can mean either "There is no need" or "There is no possibility" depending on context.However, what are the differences Are there any nuances which I should be aware of Can they simply be interchanged in any circumstance"There is no need" example:わざわざここに来る必要はないvsわざわざここに来ることはない"There is no possibility" example:今日の会議を忘れる可能性はないvs今日の会議を忘れることはない

でしょう can usually be understood to mean "probably." But does it sometimes mean the same thing as ですね What other meanings can it have Can it mean "you know"
No I'm not claiming the Altaic hypothesis so try not to bring that up in answers.Still there are grammatical similarities between Japanese and Turkish such as agglutination and use of postpositions rather than prepositions. My knowledge of Japanese helped me get some basic Korean even though they are not established to be related either so I am interested in finding some detailed comparison that may help me shoehorn my Japanese knowledge to get me started in Turkish too... and for more general understanding of both languages.
Title says it all!If somebody called and left a message, when calling them back, is there a set expression for thatI generally just use "さっきにお電話頂いた...", but wondering if there is a more idiomatic way to say this.(this happens a lot more in a business situation, but I'd be interested to hear if there are suggestions for casual situations as well)
Reasons for omitting titles like 'さん' after names of entertainers, performers and public figures「記者ハンドブック 新聞用字用語集」によると、運動、芸能欄などのスポーツ選手、芸能人には敬称をつけない[出典]そうです。新聞以外のメディアや、日常会話でも上のような公人に敬称を付けないことは普通です。石川遼のような生命保険 (第一生命の商品のキャッチフレーズ)敬語が重要な一部である日本語において、敬称の省略が許されている理由・考え方は何でしょうか個人的な印象では、芸能人やスポーツ選手は日常生活の外で起こっている物語の中の登場人物で、直接性がないために尊敬や丁寧の意をあらわす必要がないからだろうか、という気がします。信頼のおける本や理論を元にした説明があるとなおよいです。答えは日本語でも英語でもかまいません。Meta note: Part of the intention behind this question is to work out how to handle bilingual content. ref: meta: Do questions have to be in English
Most particles seem to be postpositions but I'm sure I've seen say a noun followed by a location particle followed by "wa" or "ga" or possibly "wo" but when I've tried to use it I've only confused my Japanese friends.Under what circumstances can multiple particles end up next to each other and what's the most that could end up in sequence

When we have a する verb (e.g. 支{し}度{たく}する、案{あん}内{ない}する、心{しん}配{ぱい}する), is it true that we could optionally insert an を particle in between the noun and the するBecause in the example sentences here and here, we can see this usage (the usage of を particle appearing between the noun and the する).So basically am I right to say that for all する verbs, we can optionally include (or exclude) an を particle in between the noun and the するIf not, how exactly should we decide whether or not to include that を I mean I know with a lot of usage we will just know it, but are there any rules that we can apply here
In the past few years, reading light novels and the like, I have come across many different terms for ghosts, spirits, monsters, etc. in Japanese, and I'm wondering how they relate to each other. What are the differences Is there some kind of Venn diagram that illustrates this An article that describes the differences maybe Your help is appreciated.I will list all of the words that I've heard that fit into this category, in no particular order. I'm sure there are more, but these are the ones I can recall.化け物（ばけもの）/ お化け（おばけ）妖怪（ようかい）怪物（かいぶつ）/ 怪獣（かいじゅう）魑魅魍魎（ちみもうりょう） (I particularly liked this one)怪異（かいい）幽霊（ゆうれい）鬼（おに）変化（へんげ）First Update: I've grouped synonyms as suggested in the answers below, and added one more.The answers below provide quite a bit of information, but also leave quite a bit unanswered. In @Kafka Fuura's response, 「怪異」 is defined as 「化け物」 or 「変化」 -- so is it an umbrella term, or are these all actually synonymsAdditionally, 「魑魅魍魎」 are described as 怪物, but then are further defines as "various types of 化物". Does that mean that 怪物 are a subset of 化け物I guess what I was wondering is how these groups inter-relate with each other. Can anybody tell me what the taxonomy of these groups is, or at the very least provide some sort of reference which does so (even in Japanese)** One possible such reference is the novel 魍魎の匣, suggested by @Kafka Fuura, but I'd prefer something more detailed.Second Update: Since my last update, I have come across more information which is relevant to this question, specifically, The Kaii-Youkai Denshou Database.According to their introduction, 妖怪 are supernatural creatures (examples given include kappa and tengu), while 怪異 are essentially unexplained, strange phenomena. They also say earlier in the introduction that the terms もののけ, 化け物, 変化, etc. are words which were used to refer to 妖怪 and 怪異. So is it safe to say that these two are umbrella terms which encompass everything else
both have the similar English of "answer," but when do you use one over the other
ハイオク：　１４８？  レギュラ：　１３７？  軽油：　１１５？What meaning do the question marks have
I understand that 〜すれば〜するほど is used to mean "the more you do ~ the more ~". However, I don't see how this meaning is derived from this sentence pattern. I assume the ば is from the conditional form and ほど is supposed to mean "extent".人が多ければ多いほど楽しい == "The more the merrier".However if we look at this from the actual construction it seems like: "If there are more people, the extent of more is fun."This may sound weird, but I can't comprehend it in terms of Japanese, am I looking at it incorrectly Is ほど a particle in this case A noun Of course I can look at it and think in English "oh that sentence pattern means 'the more x the more y' and be on my way, but I would like to be able to understand in terms of Japanese grammar.Additionally, it appears in a similar construction:人が多いほど楽しいIn this construction, does it merely link 多い and 楽しい in a fashion that means if one is high, so it the other Is it a particle in this caseEdit:To clarify, I understand the meaning and logical use of ほど in sentences such as:彼ほど日本語がうまくない kare hodo nihongo ga umakunaiあいつを殺したいほど嫌いだ aitsu wo koroshitai hodo kirai daThese sentences make logical sense to me. "I hate him to the extent of wanting to kill him.", etc.However, when it is used in sentences such as the following, ほど seems closer to 方が and I can't see the relation to "extent".多いほど楽しい  ooi hodo tanoshii  ~= The more the better.早いほどいい hayai hodo ii ~= The sooner the better.vs多い方が楽しい ooi hou ga tanoshii早い方がいい hayai hou ga ii
I noticed that there are some adjectives that have ～がる suffix to make them into verbs. Some examples from WWWJDIC:ほしがる  こわがる  いたがる  くるしがる  さびしがる  うれしがるApparently ～たい form also can take the ～がる suffix to become ～たがる suffix:いきたがるRikaichan popup explains the ～がる as:to feel (on adj-stem to represent third party's apparent emotion); to behave as if one wereSo I thought that I could append this suffix to any adjectives to add those connotations. However, it seems that not all adjectives and ～たい have the suffix. WWWJDIC does not return any exact matches for the following words:やさしがる  (to behave as if one were nice)  きたがる  (to feel that one wants to come - Since いきたがる exists so logically きたがる should exist too)  ねむがる (to behave as if one were sleepy)My question is, as in the title, is ～がる suffix limited to specific adjectives only How do we know which adjectives can have the suffix and which adjectives can't

In the linguistics topic of language typology, Japanese is often included in lists of agglutinative (or agglutinating) languages, but when learning or reading about Japanese grammar exclusively this is rarely if ever mentioned. Other examples of agglutinative languages are Turkish, Finnish, Hungarian, and Basque.Languages always considered agglutinative usually talk about things like lots of case inflections on nouns or lots of "slots" for various infixes and affixes in the potentially long endings of both verbs and nouns. Japanese in contrast usually talks about lots of particles and lots of verb endings only.So is it true that Japanese is an agglutinative language and how should we regard this in relation to how we normally discuss Japanese grammar

What kind of negative conjugation is it
I'd like to know if I can put ～じゃん at the end of every adjective, if there are any exceptions to that usage, and if it's different from ～じゃない.Adj (na) + じゃん便利じゃん便利だったじゃん便利じゃないじゃん便利じゃなかったじゃんAdj (i) + じゃん楽しいじゃん楽しかったじゃん楽しくないじゃん楽しくなかったじゃんIs this possible Wouldn't the correct way would be 楽しくない instead of 楽しいじゃんVerb + じゃんあるじゃんやるじゃんいるじゃんくるじゃん...
Is 呪縛 usually used to refer to a good spell or a bad one (like a curse)I mean the dictionary writes the english meaning as: spell/curse but I was wondering what sort of nuance would be attached to 呪縛 Because I was watching this show and they were saying stuff like: it's not a curse (呪い), but a spell (呪縛)So well from that i grasp that.. uh the nuances of 呪い are evil spells/curses, whereas the nuances of 呪縛 are neutral spells/good spells

With many 擬音語 (ぎおんご, onomatopoeia) and 擬態語 (ぎたいご, mimetic words) there is a double form, where the word is repeated, and a form with っと at the end. For example:きらきら -&gt; きらっと (sparkling)  ぴかぴか -&gt; ぴかっと (twinkling)  ぺろぺろ -&gt; ぺろっと (slavering)  ちらちら -&gt; ちらっと (fluttering)  ごろごろ -&gt; ごろっと (rumbling)  どきどき -&gt; どきっと (suddenly)Is there one of these forms for every 擬音語/擬態語 I couldn't find some in the dictionary. How are the two forms used differently Is this っと just another grammatical form (like という) And what about the similar forms ちらり, ちらりと and ちらと or きらりと and きらり
Whenever I go to the Life supermarket near my house, they ask me at the check out:ライフカードを持っていますか？　(Do you have a Life  [members] card)I always respond with something like:いいえ、持っていません。持っていません　(motteimasenn) means I don't have it, but I think more precisely it means I am not carrying it on me. As in, I have a member's card, but not with me right now.It seems like the right way to answer, with the negative form of the verb they used in the question. And the person at the check out always seems to understand what I mean.However, I'm thinking it would be more accurate to answer:いいえ、ありません。Which means "no, [I] don't have [a members card]." I think saying ありません means that it's not just that I don't have one with me, I don't have one at all - which is the case.So, which is the more accurate way to respond 持っていません or ありません

After reading this thread: When would you use 低い【ひくい】 vs 短い【みじかい】, I'd just thought of something.I once heard that a long nose (witch / Pinocchio) is called 高い鼻 and not 長い鼻 whereas the opposite (short nose) is called 低い鼻　and never 短い鼻. but i couldn't be sure (i mean in english, a tall nose just sounds wrong)Does anyone know what's the difference between a 低い鼻 vs 短い鼻 and a 高い鼻　vs a 長い鼻
In English, the word "help" can be used for any of these cases to ask somebody for help or to give a help to someone:In a store, when a clerk (store worker) says: Can I help you, sirWith friends, when you see that your friend needs some help on math:Do you want a help with mathWhen someone is carrying heavy things:Shall I help youWhen it's me who needs some help.I want a help to make cookies.Help with household things (housework) such as cleaning, ironing:Son, please help me cleaning the dishes.To thank:Thanks for your help.  I'm happy that I could help you somehow.In what situations are the Japanese expressions "手伝う", "手を貸す", and "助ける" (or in the forms "手伝いましょうか", "手伝ってくれ", "手を貸して。", "助けてくれ。", :教えてあげる。", "教えよっか")  used
I was thinking, and I can't express the word "some" in Japanese.Examples:There were some fruits on the table. (I would say "テーブルの上に果物があった）Maybe 少しあった - but then I would translate as "there were few fruits".There are some people here I know, and some I've never seen!I still have some things to buy for that trip.some of those CDs were broken.we will have some news soon, just wait some minutes.Yoroshiku!Thanks
The small っ (tsu) is usually used before a consonant to indicate gemination, less technically known as doubled consonants, which is how they are transliterated in romaji.I have seen it at the end of some of what I call "vocal noises" where I interpreted it as possibly a glottal stop. But the other day I saw it used on an advertising poster on public transport at the end of a word. At least so it looked. What does it signify in this caseThe text in the ad is:お待たせっ!新しいタフマン参上!!
Why is it that in Japanese sentence one sees 男 or 女 with furigana that says ひと Furigana is supposed to help clarify the meaning of a kanji character, but using ひと doesn't seem to help clarify anything. So what's the point of doing that
what's the difference between ところで and ちなみに Are they always/often/seldom interchangeable
My first question is about the rules of pronunciation of the letter "H".Some people pronounce the "H" as if it were "Sh". For example, "Shijutsu" instead of "Hijutsu", or "Shiyori" instead of "Hiyori".Is there any rule about it Or is it just a matter of regional accent where some southern Japanese people pronounce the "H" as "Sh" Or maybe, the older you get, the more you accentuate the letters.
I know of four countries with a specific kanji besides Japan: China, the Netherlands, the USA and UK. The last two must be quite recent (I presume 19th century) but I wonder on the details and context of the selection.There is of course 蘭, abbreviated from 阿蘭陀　(o-ran-da/holland)  used in 蘭学, dutch learning.
I wanted to mention to a female staff member in a shop that I visit every day that I had seen their photograph in the Shibuya shop. I was going to say:渋谷店であなたの写真を見た。..but あなた seemed too intimate. If I knew their name, I could have said, for example:渋谷店で田中さんの写真を見た。..also きみ seemed too casual.渋谷店で君の写真を見た。What is the most natural way to refer to someone when you don't know their name and don't have a close relationship with them
For example, both 悲しさ and 悲しみ are glossed as “sadness” in JMdict. What's the differenceAccording to A Dictionary of Basic Japanese Grammar, 〜み “is more emotive and concrete characterization of some state”, while 〜さ “describes, in an analytical manner, the degree of state represented by an adjective”.The book uses a few examples to highlight the difference, but I can't make sense of it.
As I was studying vocabulary today, I happened to come across the titular 十干 which are as follows:[甲]{こう}　•　[乙]{おつ}　•　[丙]{へい}　•　[丁]{てい}　•　[戊]{ぼ}　•　[己]{き}　•　[庚]{こう}　•　[辛]{しん}　•　[壬]{じん}　•　[癸]{き}There's a somewhat lengthy definition near the middle of this page.I happened across this while looking up the word へい（塀 - wall), and the first entry in my プログレッシブ dictionary was 丙（へい）- showing the definition as "3rd rank" or a "grade of C (in school)".  I proceeded to find that 甲 and 乙 are also used to mean a grade of A and B respectively.My questions are:Are these used in modern Japanese for ranking things  If so, all of them, or just like the first 3  And what kinds of things are ranked this wayIs this a part of 尺貫法 or is it something completely separate[Side note: would anyone be interesting in making/helping to make a community wiki on 尺貫法  I find it strangely fascinating for some reason.]
How did the character for "leather" - [革]{かわ ／ カク} - come to also convey the meaning for "newness"  広辞苑 lists one of the definitions (under かく) as あらたまること, あらためること, and we can see this in some of its associated 熟語: 変革, 改革, 革新. Anyone know how this came to be
totemo means "very"suki means "like"daisuki means "like very much"If I really like something can I use totemo totemo daisuki desu
This question has come up on the side of at least a couple of other questions, but I don't think it's been definitively answered, so let's see if we can come up with something solid.After going through the first ten pages of Google results for both "ていてください" and "ていて下さい" (very scientific, I know), I found 43 verbs and expressions that precede these forms. The most common:待つ (まつ):                50 results見る (みる):                33楽しみにする (たのしみにする):  25覚える or 憶える (おぼえる):  19生きる (いきる):              9期待する (きたいする):         5見守る (みまもる):            4強いる (しいる):              3離れる (はなれる):            3知る (しる):                 3思う (おもう):                3待つ is somewhat expected, but there are some interesting entries here, such as 生きる and 離れる. How is 生きてください different from 生きていてください, and likewise, how is 離れてください different from 離れていてください At a minimum, let's try to answer:What is the difference in nuance between these twoWhen should you choose one over the otherBonus points if you can draw from a trusted reference.Related:What does the final て in 待ってて signifydeceze's answer for Am I coming or going 戻ってくる vs 戻っていく
If someone says それだけ、食べないでください, does it mean:Please don't eat only that [eat other things too!]or[You can eat anything you like but] only that, please don't eat it.What about それだけ、たべてください  Does it mean:Please eat only that [and don't eat anything else].or[I don't really care if you eat anything else but] only that, please eat it.
This is a bit of an ad hoc question, but still should be well within the scope of JLU, so here goes:While trying to come up with ideas for our new logo in the meta group (subliminal message: go and participate!), the idea of an inkan-like 2x2 kanji logo was bounced around:用 日法 語(read vertically)The design Derek made looks quite spiffy, but I am having some light doubt about the use of "日語" as a stand-in for "日本語" (for balance and style, using the full 3-kanji compound is not really an option). While the meaning is quite obvious, I wonder how accepted this "abbreviation" is, and whether it would look natural to a native.My question is: has anybody ever encountered 日語 used to mean 日本語 in a similar context Do you have any example to point me to that could put my worries to restAlternatively: can you think of any good two-kanji compound to say the same thing (I did think of 和語, but my dictionaries say it has a specific meaning, different from just "Japanese language").
There are three unique words that begin with こころ～:快い　（こころよい）、　試みる　（こころみる）、　志　（こころざし）What is the origin of these words in relation to "heart/spirit/mind", if any  Or is this just something coincidental  Why do only two of them have こころ in the kanji itself, but not the thirdBy their meanings, I can kind of see how they relate to "heart/spirit/mind", but why are there only three such words that became so unique (I'm discounting ones like 心がけ、心構え、etc.)
I found this phrase 「家族に突っ込まれまくった」 and I believe it means "[my] family really stuck it [to me]" but I'm not familiar with the suffix まくる.Any examples and clarifications would be appreciated.
As Derek mentioned in his postscript, both こと and の are nominalizers that can turn a verb into a noun.ピアノを弾く【ひく】。 I play the piano.ピアノを弾く【ひく】のが好き【すき】です。 I like playing the piano.ピアノを弾く【ひく】ことが好き【すき】だ。 I like playing the piano.I had always thought こと was just a more formal version of の, but it seems that's not the case:As a quick rule, の is generally used when the outer action happens at the same place or time as the inner action, while こと is generally used when the two can be considered from a removed standpoint lacking immediacy.Can someone elaborate more on the distinction between こと and のWhich version is more appropriate when the outer verb is an emotion verb such as 好き【すき】、思う【おもう】、考える【かんがえる】, etcIs こと generally more preferred in formal writing
Today I was laughing my heads off reading puns at 言いまつがい, which is a collection of user-contributed accidental puns and other mistakes.It struck me that I never experienced this kind of uncontrollable laughter with puns in English. Is it possible that the Japanese language have more room to generate possible puns, raising the number of funny punsI'd be happy to be proven wrong, but then again, I'm equally curious to know what language features of Japanese make it such a prolific pun producer.Note: Sananmuunnos, a sort of verbal play in the Finnish language, looks close to Japanese puns (だじゃれ). Wikipedia explains why Finnish has a large pool of possible spoonerisms:As Finnish is a mora-divided language, it is morae that are exchanged, not syllables. Also, Finnish inflectional and derivational morphology is extensive, thus applying a suffix from another word often produces a valid word. This leads to large number of possible spoonerisms.I don't understand all of this, but this is the kind of explanation I'm looking for.
I was wondering what the meaning of かい and き is for the Google Summer Solstice Doodle pictured here:I'm guessing it has some relation to summer, but what
How do these two differ, for example:寂しそう vs 寂しげ楽しそう vs 楽しげ言いたそう vs 言いたげ大人げ vs 大人っぽい（...？ Not sure if this one works.)
Simplest example would be when you are getting a coffee and ask for a paper cup. It seems that both 紙の and 紙で are acceptable. What are the differences
I've read that people usually change ない to ねー to make it more manly, like:したくないよ becomes したくねーんだSo basically i often heard questions ending with ない but have not heard anyone end a question with ねーHence this question: can we use ねー as a questionExample:[There's a party tomorrow]明日、行かない？ converted to 明日、行かねー？what about this: 明日、行かねーんだ？
I frequently pass by an elderly neighbor who lives in the same apartment when coming home from a dog walk. He's kind of an in-house carpenter for the building and is frequently seen around the garage. I usually just nod to him with a small murmur that sounds like こんにちは.Now this chap is not exactly as close as a family, so ただいま doesn't quite feel right. But he's more on a talking basis rather than a higher-up, which rules out ただいま戻りました. I've seen ただいまです used in the Internets but not in spoken Japanese.What's the appropriate words of greeting in this situation

Improve this question                    (I apologize if this question is off-topic on Japanese.SE or is more suitable for SuperUser).I like to write computer notes about what I learn in Japanese. From time to time, I would like to be able to include in my text a given radical, say kokoro 心, which takes several graphic forms when used as an element in a more complex kanji, for instance . I did not succeed on my system (Mac OS X 10.7) to find the glyphs for these variants exactly as I would like them (I would also be interested about how to do this on Windows 7 or Linux).I first tried the name of the kanji from which the radical is derived.　Then I tried to use the japanese name for them, such as risshinben (as in 快)　and shitagokoro (as in 志), hoping that the  hiragana or katakana input would recognize them and propose me their representation, but it did not work. So I looked into the Full Japanese Character Table, under the "by radical" tab, and found at  least a version of each of them : 忄 (CJK 5FC4) and 㣺 (CJK 38FA) with the correct kun readings. I have them now as favorites but do I need to do that for all radicals Do I need to register all of them in a user dictionary  I would imagine that I am not the only one who wants to do use them.Besides, the versions I have found are not suited for all occasions: they are centered on a standard kanji square. If I want them to appear near to a placeholder, or demonstrate their proportion to the rest of a typical kanji, I have to make complicated adjustments, depending on my use and the kind of radical.
In a recent question I asked, this example sentence was offered:映画を見る。 (I will watch a movie.)What struck me about this was that the translated version was the future tense.However, I always thought the plain form of a verb was tense-less.映画を見る。 I watch a movie.When I think about it, though, if the plain form is without tense (or at least not future tense), then it wouldn't really be used much except in answer to a question:Q: 退屈しているときには、通常に何をしている？ (What do you  usually do when you're bored)A: 映画を見る。(I watch a movie.)Maybe I just have it all wrong.Is the plain form usually assumed to be future tense Or at least an expression of intent
I always thought that a verb ending in the て form along with the いる suffix was the English equivelent of the "ing" form of a verb.Thus:see = 見{み}る, seeing = 見{み}ているdo = する, doing = しているHowever, according to the Wikipedia entry on gerunds, a gerund in Japanese is when you add the particle の.Say whatTo be honest, I'm not actually that interested in grammatical technicalities, such as what label is applied to what verb form.What I am very interested in, though, is usage.So what, precisely, is the difference in meaning and implication between:見{み}ている見{み}ているの見{み}るの(This question is a spin off from "What is the difference between は and のは")
The many ways to say “and” in Japanese thread showed me that ～し, ～し can be used give reasons for something.この部屋は綺麗だし広いし間取りもいいから人気がある。This room is clean, wide and also good partition, so most of the people like it.  ねむいし仕事があるし (I'm sleepy, and I have work to do, and...[I really don't want to] [so I can't do what you're asking])Seems kind of like ｘし、 ｙし　[だ]から　ｚ.Can it be used the other way around: ｚから、 ｘし、 ｙし.　For example, 今は休暇だから本を読んでるし、泳げるようになってるし、リラックスしてる。And how about for just serial actions, for example in reply to something like 今日は何をしてる？By the way, I don't remember seeing ～し in any textbooks so far, is it something you'd only use with friends
I am looking for a way to express the equivalent of "statistically speaking, ..." (followed by a quote from a paper, or something like that), or pretty much any other grammatical construction that works well for the subject of quoting statistics or papers.I know the word 統計, but that always results in very cumbersome (and probably wrong) sentences, such as:統計の論文を読んだ、  統計の見方から、I am sure Japanese people will understand what I try to express, but it's hardly correct.While I honestly care about the answer and do not know it, I have also made this question for meta-discussion: Who is our target audience
Is the title ～[殿]{どの} used in modern day Japanese  If so, which people can you use it with I've only really seen it come across in referring to [大]{だい}[名]{みょう} (feudal lords). Also it is applicable to use as a translation of "sir" of people who have been knighted by the queen of England
As a studies of Japanese I've come across two distinct ways to group verbs for purposes of remembering how to conjugate them.う動詞 / る動詞Group1 / Group 2Pacerier mentioned a verb1 and verb5, can someone explain to me how the verbs are divided for this systemAlso, how do Japanese people learn the different conjugations patterns What system for verb classification do they usethis question may boarder on off-topic, but i think as a Japanese learner, I'd like to be able to ask verb related questions to a Japanese person, but if i say う動詞, unless they are familiar with non-foreigners learning Japanese, they don't know what I'm talking about.
I read once somewhere that the word 'sake' (酒, Japanese rice wine) comes from sha-ke (鮭, salmon). Can someone explain what this connection is Any thoughts on why most Japanese people * don't know the origin of the word sake are also appreciated.*Most Japanese people who I know ... @Tsuyoshi Ito may know more.
I've read that both the ～てしまう and ～きる (18th meaning of 切る at http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/cgi-bin/wwwjdic.cgi1MUE%E5%88%87%E3%82%8B) forms are used to signify something has been finished/done/completed.If so, what exactly is the difference between the two conjugations (how do we decide when to use which)example:1) もう荷造りしてしまった。2) もう荷造りしきった。

Improve this question                    Just for fun, I'm curious about how native speakers do mental translation from Gregorian calendar year (e.g 2011) to Japanese era name 年号 (e.g. 平成２３年), and vice versa. Do you have special and preferably fun ways like mnemonics or children songs (something like the ABC song) to help you do the translation on-the-flyp/s: Due to subjectiveness of this question, I'm totally fine if this is made into community wiki.
In this Question about computer science jargon, most answers to date are electronic resources and that makes sense.But I would like to know if there are printed japanese/english or japanese/german dictionary which gives careful consideration to scientific, technological and philosophical (analytical, epistemology) meanings of kanjis without being too difficult to peruse for a non-native learner. I would not be able to comfortably use a japanese-only reference.It does not need to be strictly a dictionary. I am interested in printed books about scientific japanese writing for instance, or specialized documents with a glossary for that specialty. I remember among other things seing a japanese colleague with a nice book about german philosophical concepts and their kanji approximation and translation. I presume there are other such books in areas such as biology, cognitive sciences, physics, history of science.
I understand that 擬音語 (ぎおんご) imitate sounds, like どきどき imitates a heartbeat. So, if these onomatopoeia don't have roots I wouldn't be at all surprised.But where do 擬態語 (ぎたいご) come from Do いらいら (to be irritated), きらきら (to glitter), すっきり (to be refreshed/relieved) have root wordsIt was said on this Japanese.SE question that ぴかぴか came from 光 (ぴかり), is this generally the case or an exception
According to dictionaries, the WA 和 in 昭和 has both the meaning of peace, harmonious and Japan, japanese (although mostly as the first kanji of a compound, such as in 和語).  So I wonder how Japanese of those times perceived the announcement and the phrase.Did it carry immediately a meaning of (luminous) Peace for Japan, or was the national or identity element not present for a native speaker
The following sentence means "seeing all the different foreign people was interesting."This, according to my Japanese friends is incorrect:色々な外国人を見ているは面白かった。... and this is correct:色々な外国人を見ているのは面白かった。To me, the difference is so subtle that I can't really get a feel for how the presence of の really changes it.Can someone provide an explanation that clarifies what makes の important in this situationUpdate: I'm actually still confused by this.Couldn't the first example mean "Looking at the various foreigners was interesting", and the second example mean "That I was looking at the various foreigners was interesting"
I'm a little unclear on the use a verb stem, followed by に and another verb.Take these two examples:特別なビザをもらって行った特別なビザをもらいに行ったI think the first means "I went with a special visa", but it might be simply grammatically incorrect.The second, I think means "I went to get a special visa". I'm pretty sure it's grammatically correct as I got it from a native speaker.I have a lot of bad habits when speaking Japanese, and I think one of them is that I often mess up and use the first form when I should use the second.So I just want to be clear. Is the first example simply incorrect grammar (and therefor meaningless), or does it mean what I thinkAlso, do I have the translation on the second example correctThis might be related to the difference between に and で as in this question.
There's this rather unpleasant sign on a restaurant that says:中国人＆帰化人、残留孤児、中国系混血人児、絶対入店禁止、純血日本男児のみ。Putting aside the racist content, from a linguistic point of view, the one word that throws me is 人児. It's not in Yahoo, Denshi Jisho,  or Goo dictionaries.I know in general that it means people and children, but I'm unclear on exactly how to read and define it.What is the right reading ひとこ、ひとじ、じんこ、じんじ And does it mean "young people", or "adults and kids", or "adults or children", or something elseLastly, is it actually a compound, or is it just the two individual kanji with their individual meanings that are beside each other like a list (as in "adults, children")
Why is the correct counter for rabbits 羽（わ）, the counter that is used for birds.  I figured it is because they jump, cause fly and jump are the same verb in Japanese, but then frogs are 匹.
I know that -たち and -ら pluralize the nouns they come after (or indicate a group that the noun is part of), but most of the time the plural in Japanese is implicit.  When is it appropriate or necessary to use -たち or -ら(Bonus question: is there any difference except formality between -たち and -ら)
In particular which one is closer to the idea of "ability to reason over things" as a quality of someone in particularWhat I believe is that 知識 on the other hand is closer to "knowledge" and "understanding"　and 眼識　is more about "discrimination, insight", but as an intellectual operation, not a property attached to someone, like 認識.
I see that those two compounds mean husband and wife, as a married couple. But is there a difference in usage or context
I've noticed (through much frustration) that many 自～／他～ pairs have "opposite" forms; particularly with the ~u and ~eru types.  For example, 焼く・焼ける are opposite from 開く・開ける.焼く　（他）　－　パンを焼く ("Bake bread")焼ける　（自）－　パンがちょうどよく焼けた ("The bread was baked just right")開く　（自）　－　ドアがひとりでに開いた！怖いでしょう！ ("The door opened by itself!  Isn't that creepy")開ける　（他）－　彼女のためにドアを開けてあげる ("I open doors for my girlfriend")Is there any logical reason that some pairs like these have "opposite" forms  Or is it just to piss off the people trying to learn them
I observed in drama and anime (being outside Japan, those are my only ways of keeping in touch with spoken 日本語) that elder people sometimes say お出で to younger people when they want to say something like "Come here". But there are a few things I think are strange with that word/phrase:The word seems to originate from お出でになる which is お + verb stem + になる humble form, which from the kanji used means that お出でになる is the humble form of 出る, I think. So, does that mean that if a person says お出で to another person, the first person is using a humble form upon the second person, which seems to be rude Is the humbleness nuance within お出でになる still retained in お出でSince the pronunciation of お出で is お - い - で, does that mean the 出 kanji is pronounced as い Why isn't the お + verb stem + になる of 出る simply お出になる Is this another ateji

The fermented rice alcohol called "sake" in English is usually referred to as 日本酒【にほんしゅ】 in Japanese, while 酒【さけ】 merely means "alcohol" in general.Yet, all dictionaries list both "alcohol" and "fermented rice alcohol/sake/nihonshu" as translations for the word 酒. Lately, I have noticed 酒 used a few times in movies to mean "nihonshu" specifically (e.g. with one character ordering a beer, and another ordering "sake").I imagine the use of 酒 for "sake" was the standard in ancient times (and only evolved after the introduction of other popular alcoholic beverages), but can anybody tell me if there is any modern context where it is still commonly used In such a case, would it be more or less formalEdit: Yuji's answer below also made me realise that the use of the polite form (お酒) might play a role in differentiating the two senses ()

When describing intransitive actions that are commencing, I often end up saying dumb things like 沸き始まる (わきはじまる) instead of 沸き始める (わきはじめる) - starting to boil.

The gag expression 掘った芋いじるな (hotta imo ijiruna) sounds to japanese ears uncannily like "What time is it now" I'm guessing this is Showa era humour, since English probably sounded more foreign then than now.Does anyone know the origin of this saying, and anything about how popular it was (or wasn't)For bonus points: do you know of any other gag expressions like this I only know one other: アメリカではバス降りたい時は何と言いますか？ 。。。揚げ豆腐(あげどうふ) = I get off.
For example, from the song Fare Well by L'Arc~en~Ciel:あなたは いつまでも この僕のこと 愛してくれたのかなand countless examples from manga, like:だが このオレは 死なん...こんどは このオレが きさまを 滅ぼすこのオレに 勝てるわけがないMy guess is that it この + first-person-pronoun is just emphasis, but is there anything more here

The Japanese hiragana and katakana syllabaries can mostly be described as phonetic. But there are two exceptions, the two pairs of syllables modified to be voiced with the dakuten diacritic which turns them into homophones:す (su) → ず (zu); つ (tsu) → づ (zu)　し (shi) → じ (ji); ち (chi) → ぢ (ji)The same goes for katakana:ス (su) → ズ (zu); ツ (tsu) → ヅ (zu)シ (shi) → ジ (ji); チ (chi) → ヂ (zi)So are these pairs always pronounced the same or are there sometimes subtle differences The former of each pair seems to be the more common, are the latter in each pair much used How does one choose which to use when spelling words in kana What about for spelling foreign words or names in kana

One thing I have noticed among my Japanese coworkers is that it seems that they overuse the verb "confirm" when translating 確認する:テストを確認する ("confirm the tests")彼と確認して欲しい ("[I want you to] confirm this with him")確認方法 ("method of confirmation")ご確認の程よろしくお願いします。 ("Please confirm this.")Or also advice like: "You should improve you confirmation skills".I am not a native English speaker though, I think that "check" would sound more natural.As in "check the tests", "please check with him", "how to check" etc...Can somebody confirm this
I'm vaguely aware that the usage of furigana is based on the intended target audience. The younger or less likely literate the target audience the more furigana are employed. But is there a system to decide which words receive furigana and which don't In intermediate novels I find it not unusual to find furigana on words that were printed without just a few pages earlier. Is this done because somebody decided that that word/reading is less likely to be known in that context, or is it pretty "tekitō"
Is there a difference in usage between these words演算 (えんざん)算出  (さんしゅつ)計算 (けいさん)
Both 完了 and 終了 seem to have the connotation of finished/complete, but what is the difference, if any, in usage
Both 問い合わせ and 依頼　can mean to ask, but my co-workers are using both words in the application we are working on as if they are two different words.  I have a suspicion one is transitive and one is intransitive in their usage, but not entirely sure.Edit: From the comments an enquiry and a request are both asking for information. That is where i was getting confused.
開ける, 明ける and 空ける are all read as あける.From their kanji, it is obvious that 開ける has to do more with opening (a door etc), 明ける with dawning and 空ける with emptying...However, JMDict gives the exact same senses for all three of them (in fact, lists them as the same word):開ける(P); 空ける(P); 明ける(P) 【あける】 (v1,vt) ① (esp. 開ける) to open (a door, etc.); to unwrap (e.g. parcel, package); ② (esp. 開ける) to open (for business, etc.); ③ (esp. 空ける) to empty; to clear out; to make space; to make room; (v1,vi) ④ (esp. 明ける) to dawn; to grow light; ⑤ (esp. 明ける) to end; (P)OK, not quite the same senses for all (each sense is given a "preferred" kanji), but still seems to claim that there might be cases where one kanji spelling could be used instead of another.Is this an error in JMDict (and should all three have separate definitions), or can anybody think of cases where the above spellings are used instead of one anotherEdit: to clarify, my question could be summed up as:Does your dictionary disagree with mineif not:Can you give me one situation example where any two of the above spellings could be used interchangeably (with or without minor differences in nuance)
Today I saw onigiri claiming to contain "しゃけ" (shake). When I asked my friend what that was, she said it was the same as "さけ" (sake), "salmon".So are these two just different readings of a kanji, regional differences, used by different generations, etc How did the two pronunciations come about Which should I use
For the longest time I've been hearing the word ダイヤ and just always assumed it meant "Diamond", but found recently it all means "train schedule".  My question is, what word/language did this word originally come from
I thought the character "を" (wo) was only used for the particle whose only job was to indicate the direct object of a verb.But today I saw it at the end of an exclamation on a sign I think on a shop:西部に活力を!!So what job is を doing here
A friend just wrote this as a comment on a photo of mine on Facebook.Is it an actual word or is it what I call a "vocal noise"By "vocal noise" I mean those things which convey some meaning but they're not really lexical and can't be used like regular words. Examples in English include "shhh", "zzz", and "tsk tsk".
A little while ago I was in a shop, and about 5 minutes after I left, they phoned me to tell me I had left my USB stick there. I said I would head back and pick it up.I used 戻{もど}って行{い}く to mean "I'll go back", but I wonder if 戻{もど}ってくる would have been better, as in "I'll come back".Japanese has always tripped me up a bit in terms of which point of view one refers to when describing direction. Am I coming to where they are, or going from where I am Or are both okayNow that I think about it, English can be flexible on this as well, so perhaps there aren't strict rules. Maybe I'm over thinking it...In any case, does anyone have any pointers which can help determine when one comes to where the other person is, or when one goes from where the speaker is
This question already has answers here:                                            Closed 9 years ago.Possible Duplicate:Significance of the kanji 「茶」 in the set phrase 「滅茶滅茶 / 目茶目茶」 {めちゃめちゃ} So, in Kansai they use めっちゃ, and in Kanto 超.

How do you pronounce the Japanese "r" Is it more like an "l" or something inbetween Would there be any picture or video explaining it correctly, please link it!
if お腹が空いた means "I'm hungry",then what would be the past tense of お腹が空いた since (i think) it's already in the past tense
As a gyudon addict I have noticed that the names of the three major national restaurant chains all end in "ya" but they used two different characters:"吉野家" (Yoshinoya)"松屋" (Matsuya)"すき家" (Sukiya)Other shops and restaurants I've noticed just use the hiragana instead:"や" (ya)So is there a subtle difference where one is more like restaurant and the other is more like shop/store And is the hiragana a handy way to be ambiguous or would people reading such a sign immediately know whether "や" stood for "屋" or "家" based on their language intuitionWhile I'm at it, is this yet another character for "ya" used in the same contexts"店"
I'm having trouble putting this question into words, especially short enough to use as the question title, basically I'm confused about what the term "keigo" applies to:Is it just the addition of honorific, humble, polite, respectful elements to what otherwise might be called a "non keigo" utteranceOr is it a term which covers the whole process or set of rules governing when to apply and not apply such elementsSo is it possible to contrast vanilla plain Japanese to keigo JapaneseWhere is the line drawn When a single honorific, humble, polite, or respectful element is added to an utterance does it become a keigo utteranceTo make an utterance totally non keigo do I have to go so far as to remove the o- prefix from mizuIs keigo a continuum or an optional extraEDIT to clarify the difference between this and my previous keigo question:The previous question was to find out if "keigo" was a technical/linguistic/grammatical term or just a general term. Now that I know it's a technical term I'm trying to pin down with this question what it means and when it should and shouldn't be used.
I know the general meaning of using お疲れ様です／でした to express gratitude for some work, but I'm a bit fuzzy about appropriate times to use it.I know it is a common saying when leaving for the day, and I've also seen it in email when replying to someone who has just done some task, but are there other situations where this would be appropriate (or inappropriate)  Is there any kind of time element implied (would it sound strange in the morning)Also, when is it appropriate to just use お疲れさん instead of お疲れ様
If my manager says something that I know to be factually incorrect, how can I point that out without sounding disrespectful  (Is ~違います appropriate in this context or is that too strong)Is this a situation where I would use speech that is more formal than usual  For example, would I switch to a form of keigo for this even if I normally have a more informal relationship
I recently used a following sentence in my homework:今日までに　私は　二百まいしゃしんを　とりました。Now, in my homework I actually used 今日まで, without に, and I got it corrected. What's the difference between 今日まで and 今日までに
After showing a project to a Japanese coworker, he answered me the following: 感動した！、小泉元総理風I found this amusing, but I couldn't get the Mr.Koizumi reference. Is there a story behind this
These two phrases seem to have very similar usage and I'm unable to determine the difference between them.The examples I have are:彼は服装からしてだらしない。きっと他の面も同じだろう。kare ha fukusou karashite darashinai. kitto hoka no men mo onaji darou.症状からすると、心臓の病気かもしれません。shoujyou kara suru to, shinzou no byouki kamo shiremasen.However, both of these phrases seem to translate to the English word "from" or "based on". I've asked a few Japanese friends about the difference, but they were unable to explain it eloquently.Is it possible to switch からすると and からして in the preceding examples Will it still be grammatically correct.(Additionally, からして seems to have the meaning of "for a start" as in ひらがなからして読めない or "For a start, I can't even read hiragana." But this usage seems to be completely separate to the "from" or "based on" usage.)
I was wondering about this one recently. "Fuck" in English is famous for being applicable in a wide, wide range of circumstances (none of them formal).What word in Japanese covers a wide spectrum of possible meanings and uses like "fuck" does. Does not have to be a rude/vulgar term.Any suggestionsEDIT: half of you seem to have missed the point of my question. I don't need a translation for "fuck", I want a word as versatile. Maji is pretty good but I would've thought there'd be more contenders. Admittedly it's a vague question, but one for my izakaya zatsugaku collection.
It seems there are three words for the same Japanese food item, a kind of "sushi in a long roll":"巻寿司" (makizushi)"海苔巻き" (norimaki)"巻物" (makimono)Are they all identical / synonyms Do they refer to subtly different things Are they used in different regions Are they used by different generations of Japanese[Sidenote: At the risk of side-tracking another food question, there only seems to be one word for these in Korean: "김밥" (gimbap).]

The title should be pretty self-explanatory. What meanings does each convey And in what kinds of circumstances would one be used instead of the otherFor example, what are the differences between these two sentences図書館に本がある。図書館には本がある。
When you first begin to learn Japanese you are taught that Japanese has no stress and each syllable should be pronounced equally.You also learn that certain vowels are not pronounced, or only pronounced very slightly, such as the "u" in "desu" and the "i" in "deshita".But it seems that sometimes these vowels are pronounced if they occur in the first syllable of a word such as "sugoi", "subarashii", "shiro", "shimbun".Is this a kind of exception to both rules or is it just something a foreigner might think they hear which is not really there
The term "onigiri" covers all kinds of rice balls, with or without filling, and with or without nori seaweed around it.Is there a specific term that only covers the one class of onigiri available in supermarkets and konbinis that is triangular in shape, has a filling, and is wrapped in a special way that keeps the nori separate from the rice until it is opened so that it stays crisp(Side note: In Korean I don't know of a generic term for onigiri but there is a term for this specific kind: "삼각김밥" [samgak gimbap].)
I know that you can use ご～いただく toward "clients" (which is something I've never really understood; maybe better as a question of its own) such as ご来店いただき、まことにありがとうございます ("Thank you (customer) for coming to our store").Following this logic, I know you can express "can" with ご～いただけます.  However, the normal keigo pattern ご～になる would then (also) morph into ご～になれます.  I've heard both in practical situations, but I'm very confused as to the nuances of when to use which.For example, I'm currently translating a software help file, which is directed toward the end user.  If I want to say, "you can see X", I'm not sure if I should say ご覧いただけます or ご覧になれます.タスケテ！
What function does は provide in statements such as 本ではない or 本だとは思わない I notice the は after と is often left out, at least if a Google search for 思わない is any indication, but there still seems to be a general trend of sticking は into negatives where I presume they wouldn't be used in positive sentences (one hears です and である, but not ではある). What's going on here
How are fiction books such as novels sorted on the shelves at Japanese bookshops Kana order seems to play a small part but not the whole part.(I'm not asking about nonfiction books since those are ordered by category and are much easier to find)
I'm looking for a cheap secondhand character dictionary in Japan but:I don't know if there is one or more kind of these, and I don't know what they are called.Two I saw had these on their spines, but I don't know if they are titles or types of dictionary:漢辞海漢字典Tsuyoshi Ito suggests this term in a comment:漢和辞典Is there more than one kind of character dictionary What are the various kinds called (Please supply romaji or at least kana too)I do not need to know about general Japanese or translating dictionaries, just the ones that focus on kanji.
After reading the 2 threads: How to use へ (-e), に (-ni), まで (made) and の方 (no-hō) with destination and direction and When going somewhere, is there any difference between e (へ) and ni (に)I would like to ask how would a native ask the question "Where are you going later"1) 後どこへ行くか？2) 後どこまで？3) Context: john talking to mary 30 minutes before school ends.
i was wondering what may be the difference in nuance between 右へ曲がる and 右に曲がる Example: Take a right turn and you'll see the library.1) 右へ曲がると、図書館がある。2) 右に曲がると、図書館がある。As for [noun-location] with the verb 行く, the へ should be used when we want to emphasis the direction,  and the に particle is used when we want to emphasis the location (Source: When going somewhere, is there any difference between e (へ) and ni (に))Does this work the same way for 右[へ・に]曲がる (Since 右 is the direction itself and not a location)Or is it true that we can treat 右 and 左 as locations themselves and we can say 右へ行く　and 左へ行くIn fact if we say "Turn to the right (standing on the spot) and you will see the painting." there isn't even any direction nor location at all is it
WWWJDIC lists 差す as an intransitive verb, but in all of the example sentences I've seen it looks more like a transitive verb.So my question is, is 差す a transitive or intransitive verb
When I had the chance to go on a Jungle Cruise at Tokyo Disneyland, I noticed the skipper talked with sprinkles of prolonged vowels and uncommon rising and falling intonation patterns.Is this "dialect" original, or was it borrowed from existing profession/regionEdit: you can check video recordings of the ride on Youtube:By a male captainBy Captain Sato: Part 1, Part 2By a female captain

Mainly inspired by this question on what seems to be the misuse of a standard idiom by a Japanese employee, I was reminded of being told about バイト敬{けい}語{ご} ("manual keigo") in the past: a slightly dumbed-down sonkeigo crash course handed to new kombini recruits, that covers the basics but often results in widespread misuse of proper keigo forms at the hands of young Japanese unused to this level of speech.I know there were a couple very specific examples of classic mistakes (generally: confusions between sonkeigo and kenjôgo). Wikipedia (en) lists a few disputed forms (「おつぎのお客{きゃく}様{さま}」,「〜になります」...) present in the manuals themselves... I'd be interested to hear if anybody has other examples of egregious misuse and why they are not correct.
On the talk page of the Wikipedia article on "Japanese adjectives", user Dougalg suggested nearly two years ago:I know these are falling out of use, but still exist. If anyone can give an explanation of the taru adjectives, I'm sure that would be helpful to many peopleBut nobody took up his suggestion in the article which leaves me to wonder what it is that he was talking about. Can somebody shed some light on this "taru forms" please
Japanese has two kinds of adjectives known by several terms but the ones I know are i-adjectives and na-adjectives - whyI recall that Japanese adjectives are much more like verbs than in English and most European languages (where they are more closely related to nouns), but does this apply to both types of Japanese adjectives or only one typeI seem to remember that the two kinds are totally different to one another - is this true and if so how did each originate For instance do we know if Okinawan/Rkyukyuan languages also have two types of adjectives What about the Korean language, which is the language next most often claimed to be related to Japanese (though far from universally accepted).
I've noticed that some of my Japanese friends with fluent but imperfect English often say "too adjective" when a native English speaker would say just "very adjective".(I am asking about "too" in the sense "too big", not as in "me too")Does this reveal that English makes a distinguish that Japanese doesn't make or one which Japanese speakers would find too subtleHow would I unambiguously express each in Japanese
In my wanderings around Japan giving my kana knowledge some practice I've noticed both the words "ガール" (gāru) and "ガールズ" (gāruzu) in use at least in signage. Obviously they are borrowed from English "girl" and "girls" in turn, but is either or both of them now considered to be Japanese words, or are they merely seen as English written in katakanaIf they are now considered to be Japanese words, how do their usages differ from the native Japanese words for "girl"And if both are now considered Japanese can "ガールズ" be considered a plural of "ガール", especially since Japanese doesn't normally have a grammatical concept of plurality
Statistics seem to show that (for young males, anyway) 俺{おれ} is beginning to be used more often than 僕{ぼく} to refer to oneself. I have read that 俺 is somewhat rude.There are certain situations, of course, where you would obviously not want to use it (e.g. when speaking with your boss), but when speaking in an informal setting, does it still have a "rude" connotationHow would you feel if you are speaking to your friend and he's using 俺 all the time instead of 僕
When dining at Yoshinoya I never know how to ask for the size meal I want.Their sizes are 並, 大, and 特.I only know that "大" means big, but it also has two readings so I have no idea whether to ask for "dai" or "ooki". And since the word/character I know for "small" is not included, I assume they are using a similar gimmick to that seen in Western chains where there is no small but only "regular", "medium", "large"... sometimes up to the infamous "venti" (-:Then again maybe there are various ways of writing "small".So are these standard words or gimmicky like "venti", what do they mean literally, how do I know which reading to use for each, how would I say them in an order Are these same sizes used just about everywhere in Japanese restaurants or are there some other terms I should also know
A few years ago I was told by a Japanese friend "社会の窓" (shakai no mado).It was explained after some giggling that this is what is said to a man who has inadvertently left his fly open, and that it means literally "society's window".So why use "society's window" for this situation Is it actually an additional sense added to a more straightforward older one Or does it provide some insight into Japanese culture why such wording would be used
My boss is a native Japanese speaker.In English, when I have a question or an issue to bring up, I can ask "Do you have a minute" to see if it is an appropriate time to interrupt them.  In Japanese, when I tried the literal translation 一分【いっぷん】がありますか？ I was told I sounded like an Instant Ramen commercial.I've heard another Japanese student use ちょっといいですか？ but they were also told that's not real Japanese.I know the word 暇【ひま】but this doesn't seem like an appropriate context to use it, since my boss isn't free, I'm just interrupting him.How do I politely ask him for his time

I'm (trying) to read a Japanese spy novel at the moment.  It could just be the author's style, but I see lots of sentences end in 〜気配がする。The more I read, the more I wonder - is there any difference between this and 気がする一人で公園のベンチで本を読んだら、隣にだれか座ってきた気配がする。一人で公園のベンチで本を読んだら、隣にだれか座ってきた気がする。The above example is mine, but it was the context of the book (I am too lazy to go find the page now).A cursory look in the dictionary tells me that 気配 is more like "sense" whereas the latter may be more like "feeling" - anyone care to help
Yay, yet another first-person-pronoun question!I know that 自分 is commonly used as a personal pronoun in indirect speech, e.g.:マイクは、自分はなんと不注意なのだろうと言った。→ Mike said that he was very careless.スミスさんは自分はニューヨークの生まれだと言った。→ Mr Smith said, "I was born in New York."as well as a reflexive pronoun (for speaker or listener/third party):自分を信じて！→ Trust yourself!and as possessive, to emphasise the possession:掘っ建て小屋でもいいから自分の家が欲しい。→ I want my own house, even if it's a shack.All these make perfect sense and share the same underlying meaning of myself/yourself/oneself (with emphasis on the self). But I have also encountered (in fact even caught myself saying) 自分 in places where 私/僕/あたし/etc could have been used, with only a very weak emphasis on "myself" (e.g. not answering a "did he or did you" question):自分はスポーツが嫌い。→ I hate sports. ()My question is, is this use as a general gender-neutral 私 substitute correct (in cases where there is no particular need to assert oneself against others) And if so, what would be its speech level (e.g. could it be used in a formal context)
I've noticed the following sets of words that seem to have a very obvious pattern, and, of course, their meanings are very closely related:これ、　それ、　あれ、　どれこの、　その、　あの、　どのここ、　そこ、　あそこ、　どこWhat are the origins of these sets of words I'm asking them all together because I'm thinking that their origin is interrelated.
I have occasionally heard and read instances, where a person has referred to themselves as これ. My Japanese dictionary also lists "Me, I." as a definition of これ. Now, this obviously isn't used as frequently as 私, 僕, etc., so it makes me wonder: When can it be used to refer to one's self and Does it have any extra or particular meaning as suchThanks! :)
Is it true that the prefix 超 to mean “very” is seldom used in written works (like novels, not counting direct speech), and is usually only used when talking
is it true that なら is merely a short form of ならば and as such, both are totally interchangeable without affecting the nuance of the sentenceAlso, a second question is is ならば more "formal" than "なら"
I remember reading that there is a dialect in which older men refer to themselves as あたし. It didn't have a feminine connotation, it may have even been a bit rough.I think I read it on Wikipedia, but being as I can't find it now, I wonder if it was a prank edit. I'm also pretty sure it was a Honshu dialect.
Way back when, I remember being taught that when you want to say a really polite "thank you", sentences such as these are basically the same:文章を訂正していただきましてありがとうございます。文章を訂正してくださいましてありがとうございます。But are they really Does it make a difference if a) I specifically asked for corrections, or b) the corrections were voluntarily offeredFurthermore, if these were truly the same, why is it you always hear the first of this following pair, but rarely the second本日ご来店いただきまして、まことにありがとうございます。本日ご来店（して）くださいまして、まことにありがとうございます。Unless you switch things up a bit:本日ご来店いただいたお客様、まことにありがとうございます。本日ご来店（して）くださったお客様、まことにありがとうございます。What is the nuance buried in this pair In what "thank you" situations can one be used and not the other
My friend and I are learning Japanese. For a time, all we knew was 私, but after we learned more words, she started to use あたし when referring to herself, and I began using 僕.

Today I heard the phrase なんてことしてくれた, as in:君！なんてことしてくれたんだ！  which I learned means "Look what you've done". I thought くれる was only used when someone does something nice for you.

why is it that some 形容動詞 accepts の after it while some only accepts な after it Examples: の only: 普通、大勢な or の: 初心、特別、特殊 Is there a way for us to tell if a 形容動詞 needs a の or な particle after it.. or is it just by brute force memoryBtw my second question is that if a 形容動詞 accepts both の and な after it, is it true that usually we will use the な, even though の is grammatically correct too
Last night I had dinner in a ramen restaurant in northern Japan and was surprised to read the katakana "ライス" (raisu) on the menu. This is obviously the English word "rice" borrowed. But what kind of rice or method of preparation might it refer to given that Japanese already has "kome", "gohan", and "meshi"

I picked up a bad habit of using ～たら (a form of conditional) when I mean ～てから (once something happens, something else will happen) from a friend many years back while learning Japanese.In the years since, I learned the difference and felt bad when I still used たら out of habit. But, I was just thinking, since there are spoken short forms of various ～て forms (～ておく　→　～とく、～ている → ～てる) and I can't help but wonder if this is another case like that.In short, is ～たら　one of the spoken contractions of ～てから
What is the difference between the Japanese term "敬語" (keigo) and the English term "politeness" (Specifically regarding language)I assumed politeness is more general covering things like "please" and "thank you" and that "敬語" (keigo) specifically referred to those aspects of Japanese grammar that deal with politeness in a technical way that has no equivalent in English.But upon reading a bit and using this site a bit I'm not sure anymore. What are the overlaps and differences in meanings(I considered asking this as a meta question concerning the keigo and politeness tags but I decided it's of much broader interest.)
Is there an authoritative source that explains where the different kanji come from and what the radicals mean I think it's hard to tell from most of the textbooks/other sources whether a shown kanji's origin is correct or if it's made up. Does it even make sense to talk about the origins of some kanji in terms of its constituent radicals if that kanji is a simplified version of a traditional kanji

When do we use たくさん and when do we use 多い I found both modifiers are used within similar sentences, for example:人が多かったです  人がたくさんいましたI had this impression that 多い is used with countable nouns (i.e. similar to "many") while たくさん can be used with both countable and uncountable, but seems like it is used with "お金":ふだんの生活で使うお金が多いからか――ということですAt first, I thought maybe in Japanese language "お金" is considered as countable, unlike the word "money" in English, but again I realized I was wrong when I found:きょうは水が多いですねNow I'm thinking that maybe the concepts of countable vs uncountable in Japanese are not as significant as in English. It seems to me that both たくさん and 多い may be used interchangeably.Am I right Or are there actually places where only one of them can be used but not the otherEDIT:Additional question: how are they related to potentially antonyms 少し and 少ない Is 少し antonym of たくさん while 少ない is antonym of 多い, or vice versa, or it does not matter either way
This is a word I learned by reading and not by studying or in conversation with Japanese.After learning the kana years ago I had occasion to fly with JAL and the pre-meal snack was a little packet of various savoury crunch things like nuts and what I assume were a kind of rice cracker. Perhaps some included nori. On the pack in hiragana as I recall was written "おつまみ". To what specifically does this refer I'm often surprised that my Japanophile friends don't know what I'm talking about when I use this word.
In answer to my question on the difference between "gyūdon" and "gyūmeshi" I learned that "meshi" just means cooked rice. But I thought "gohan" meant cooked rice, so please, what is the differenceI do already know that "go-" is an honorific prefix and I think I've been told that "gohan" can sometimes be used as a general word for food. But is that all there is to it
I'm a big fan of the Japanese fast food gyudon (cooked thinly sliced beef strips on top of a bowl of boiled white rice) and its variants such as butadon (the same but with pork).But why do some chain restaurants call it "gyudon" and others "gyumeshi" Are both spelled the sameAlso at my local Japanese restaurant at home in Australia they seem to sell this dish but never understand me when I ask for gyudon. Does it have other names or are there simply dishes which seem alike to ignorant foreigners like me
I often hear Japanese using a different method for saying a number like "248" as によんぱ — especially for highways and license plates.  While this one is easy to understand, there are others that I don't quite understand.Could someone provide a list of the different pronunciations of each number  "2525" being ニコニコ is probably a good example of what I'm talking about.  1:い  2:に  3:  4:よん  5:こ  6:  7:  8:は、ぱ  9:
The other day I posted a picture of some food on Facebook, and I noticed that all of my Japanese friends were saying 「おいしそう」. I made a good guess to what it meant, but I wasn't certain what exactly they were saying. I've seen this stem+そう with other i-adjectives too, such as 楽しそう, but none of this is covered in any of my Japanese books. What exactly is this Is it slang Can it be used with na-adjectives or nouns too If so how Thanks! :)
What are the common 謙譲語 verbs that start with 「拝」  I know these ones:見る　→　拝見する (to see), 拝観する (to view something -- limited usage)聴く　→　拝聴する読む　→　拝読する会う　→　拝謁する (although I've never heard this used, and know that 目にかかる is more common)借りる　→　拝借するAre there any others that commonly used  Actually, I've used 拝読 before but was later told that no one really uses it, and お読みする was more common.
A little while back I was working my way through the Book "Japanese Sentence Patterns for Effective Communication" When I got to page 156 it explains the topic of the section which is "The te form of a verb, followed by ください, expresses a polite request or command...." It then gives some examples and asks you to solve a few problems. One of the sentences to translate was "Please carry this chair to the conference room"I worked out the problem like so会議室にこのいすを運んでください。however the answer the book gives isこのいすを会議室に運んでください。This seemed very strange because the conference room is a direct object of the chair. I am also aware that を can mean the space through which something is going, but again that usage  seems incorrect since we are talking about a destination.Can anybody explain this usage of the を particle and if my answer makes any more or less sense than the book answer If I had never seen this sentence before Im sure I could make out what it means, but the way it uses the を particle is tripping me up. Thanks!
EDICT gives almost the same translation for these two expressions:出来る限り; できる限り 【​できるかぎり】 (n) as ... as one canできるだけ 《出来るだけ》 (exp) (uk) as much as one can; as much as possible; if at all possible;Even the example sentences are almost the same:私はできる限りあなたの援助をします。 I'll help you as far as I can.できるだけ多くの本を読みなさい。 Read as many books as you canWhat is the difference between the two expressions
I'm curious if there is any difference in nuance between these two sentences:彼は少なくとも週に一度車を洗う。彼は週に少なくとも一度車を洗う。I'm aware that grammatically speaking both are 100% right, but this question is not targeted at this issue.
After I've say watched a film with some friends (or read a fable or something) and learned something from it, i want to say "It [the teachings of this fable/film] serves as a good reminder for me". I'm wondering is there a phrase in japanese which conveys this meaningIf not could I say this: 僕にとって良いリマインダとして提供してる。 Or will it sound awkward (like a non-native speaker)If so what are the alternatives
When we want to say "Hey, hurry up! you'll be late!", which would be more appropriate :遅刻するぞ！遅くなるぞ！any other suggestions？
The phrase "Unable to see the forest for the trees" implies one is too entangled in a situation to understand what is transpiring from a larger context, and thus, unable to determine the correct course of action.I'd like to know whether a native Japanese hearer: 1. told this phrase in Japanese would interpret it to have the same meaning 2. would accept the word 森 to mean a very large amount of information
In Aikido, different dojos seem to latch on to using either dori or tori when describing grabbing attacks. For instance one dojo might say:Katate DoriAnother would say:Katate ToriEach dojo will profess that their way of saying / spelling it is the more traditional and correct. Is there a difference between these two similar terms, and if so which one is more correct for denoting a grab
I've had a teacher flatly tell me that とっても is incorrect, but I do see it written here and there and I'm pretty sure I hear it as well. Is it just so informal relative to とても that I should never use it in a classroom or on schoolwork

Your methodology for translating this kind of term would also interest me :-)
What is the reason/meaning for cashiers to use ちょうど when accepting money500円ちょうどいただきます。This I understand, since 500 Yen are a "round" amount. "Exactly 500 Yen."812円ちょうどいただきます。If I'm supposed to pay exactly 812 Yen, I understand this, too. "Exactly 812 Yen, [as required]."What I don't understand is the usage when it's neither the amount required nor a round number. Say I'm asked to pay 612 Yen and I'm giving 1,112 Yen to get a 500 Yen coin in return. The cashier will still often say1,112円ちょうどいただきます。Is it just the habit of saying ちょうどいただきます, or is there a different meaning behind this ちょうど than "exactly"
In Japanese classes, I was taught that 全然 can only be used with negative-meaning words/phrases/clauses, for example:全然出来ません  全然だめですHowever, I've observed that, especially in spoken Japanese, some positive na-adjectives are allowed to follow 全然 adverb, for example:全然平気です  全然大丈夫ですOr even:全然OKですAre there any reasons why these na-adjectives do not have to follow the 全然+negative rule Given any other na-adjective with positive meaning, how to decide whether or not I can use it with the 全然 adverb (e.g. 全然きれい)p/s: I am fully aware that we have to look at the full sentence to determine whether the word/phrase/clause that follows 全然 is positive or negative, for example: {大丈夫じゃない} has negative meaning so {全然大丈夫じゃない} is OK. But I hear {全然大丈夫です} a lot in anime/drama, hence this question.
The following sentence occurs in The Legend of Zelda:ナンカ　コウテ　クレヤ(This would be なんか買うてくれや！ and was famously translated as "Buy somethin', will ya!".) From the 買うて, it's obvious he's speaking Kansai-ben, and I suspect that this usage of や is Kansai-ben as well. (I know that や is used instead of だ in Kansai-ben, but this is obviously a different usage.) But what does it mean Does it indicate some sort of insistence
According to A Guide to Remembering Japanese Characters, 森 (38) is woods and 林 (75) is forest.But some material I've found online related to Japan seems to indicate 森 is the more correct Japanese word for forest.Is the book correct or do native Japanese speakers use 森 for forest, and not 林Edit: To give a little more context I originally avoided in the question to avoid appearing commercial but now I see will help make answers more specific, one of these words is already used to brand a product. If it's the incorrect word I'll need to change the product name.I hope that helps, and I apologize if being vague hampers you giving what you feel is an appropriate response.
One thing I notice is that {～もあり} can follow an adverb, such as:良くもあり、悪くもありOther than that, when do we use {～もあり、～もあり} clause pattern instead of {～もあって、～もあって} Is using {～もあり} considered more stylish than {～もあって}自転車もあって、バイクもあってvs自転車もあり、バイクもあり   Disclaimer: my own examples so they might not even make sense ..
In some older learning material I came across, they use 「電話をかける」 for "to make a telephone call". When/why did this come to be replaced by 「電話する」 in popular usage
I'm not sure if this is actual keigo, or just a polite form of adjectives.  Anyway, there are several that we're all familiar with that are still used today.はやい　→　おはようございますありがたい　→　ありがとうございますめでたい　→　おめでとうございますThere are a couple of others I've seen in textbooks at some point as well:たのしい　→　たのしゅうございますおいしい　→　おいしゅうございます.I know that I've seen different rules for how to form these depending on the ending.  We can see that the first three end in 〜ai that it becomes 〜ou gozaimasu, and the two 〜shii ones become 〜shuu gozaimasu.However, I don't know the hard rules about how to form them based on their endings.  Furthermore, I'm even more confused about when to add the starting お (はやい adds it, but ありがたい doesn't).I know these forms aren't used much these days (except "set" phrases like the first three), but it's a piece of knowledge that has eluded me over the years.
I know one implies the thing I'm comparing actually is the thing I'm comparing it to, and the other doesn't.Can someone suggest an easy example or trick for remembering which is which
I'm pretty new to Japanese, and I've been trying to learn hiragana and katakana. I know that in hiragana, wo (を) is used only for as an object particle, and it is always pronounced like o (お).This made me wonder what the katakana form (ヲ) would be used for, since o (オ) would be used for anything with an "o" sound. Even if a direct object is written in katakana, the o that follows would still be in hiragana, correct
How did it come about historically that っ preceding a sound would geminate it Is it really a little つ or are they just near homomorphs
Apparently there are so many ways to write {かっこいい}.Hiragana/katakana only:  かっこいい  カッコいい  カッコイイ  EDICT:  格好いい  かっこ好い  Other possible variants:  格好良いかっこ良い  カッコ良い  格好好い恰好いい (notice that a different initial kanji is used)...In general, which is the most commonly used variant Are there also specific places where one variant is preferred over the others (including the common one)
As time goes on in our age of increasing reliance on computerized kanji input, this question may become increasingly irrelevant, but when I'm writing a sentence with (gasp!) pen and paper, I have always struggled to remember where the dividing line between kanji and okurigana lies with each character. Is there any way (aside from brute-force memorization, which I'm attempting at the moment) to learn and reliably recall okurigana Are there any patterns I can rely on
Superficially, I get the sense that あの is for something far away from both speaker and listener, and その is for something closer to the listener than speaker. However, I seem to get in trouble when dealing with time and past events, so I'm wondering if someone can provide a more thorough explanation of the difference
Using my computer, I type a lot of numbers in Japanese text, and I am not sure when to use half-width or full-width.Are there rulesRight now I only use half-width, is it fineOff-topic: Here is a picture of a book showing a happy mix of half-width and full-width.
Both {まじる} and {まざる} with both initial kanji characters 交 and 混 are intransitive verbs that are translated into this by rikaichan:to be mixed; to be blended with; to associate with; to mingle with; to join  (まじる has an extra meaning "to interest" though)What is the difference between the まじる and まざる readings, in term of nuances and usage Are they interchangeableEDIT:To further investigate the two variants, I conducted Google searches using +込む form, and here are the results:交ざり込むAbout 40,900 results交じ込むAbout 5,330,000 results交じり込むAbout 861,000 results混ざり込むAbout 1,230,000 results混じ込むAbout 74,900 results混じり込むAbout 1,050,000 resultsSomeone please tell me how to interpret those results.

As a near native speaker of Japanese, I find it annoying to be called 外人 since it seems to imply that I "know nothing about Japan" (outsider). I much prefer 外国人.In modern usage, how do native speakers regard the differences between 外人, 外国人 and 外人さん Also are there any newer more "PC" uses of the word coming into use (akin to not calling North American natives 'Indians')
Are there certain rules for knowing what role a radical plays in a kanji I've heard sometimes a radical tells us about how to read the kanji, and sometimes it tells us the meaning of the kanji.

Can someone explain the differences between v-ていく and v-てくる for me. I know that they both express some kind of ongoing action (like a place getting crowded). For example, what's the difference between 込んでいく and 込んでくる, or is it even possible to use both of these. Also, do you generally use kanji to write theseMost of the examples I can think of use v-てくる, like 雨がやんできた, or 空が明るくなってきた. How does the meaning change if I use いく insteadEdit: changed て行く／て来る to the more proper ていく／てくる.

While having fun looking up random words in my dictionary software, I found out that the phrase "めちゃめちゃ", which is often used in colloquial sentences like "めちゃめちゃかわいい" has two kanji variants:滅茶滅茶  目茶目茶For the first variant, 滅茶滅茶, I can imagine the significance of 滅, which implies "destruction", but why with "tea" The second variant is even absurd (or can I use "mecha-mecha" as a pun here :P), because it's from "eye" and "tea".Does the kanji character "茶" has any significance in the phrase, or are they just ateji
Sometimes I hear Japanese people say ういた in conversation when describing something (usually someone) unpleasant.  I asked my coworker once "what is this word", but I got a very poor explanation (not her fault, it just seems very much like a "sense" thing).The only impression I have of it is a word that describes someone (or their actions) that everyone else is thinking, "uhm, OK" in sort of a dumbfounded way.

I'm aware of some words in Japanese that have the same reading but different meaning depending on the pitch of each syllable. The canonical example is はし (hashi), which can mean either chopsticks (HAshi) or bridge (hashi or haSHI).However, most Japanese language books I have come across ignore the concept of pitch completely, and vocabulary lists never tell you the pitch you should use.How important is it to speak with the correct pitch Can I be understood without knowing the pitch sequence for each word

Just curious about this one.  I'm never sure what to say when I ask for chopsticks in Japanese.  I know that "by-the-book", you can count them with ～そろい　（揃い)　or ～ぜん　（膳）.  So I always say 「お箸を　一揃い（ひとそろい）／一膳（いちぜん）　お願いします。」 to ask for a pair.  But as with other things I say in Japanese, I'm afraid that this sounds too "textbookish".So I'm just wondering how native speakers ask for chopsticks (if they ever need to).  Do they use these counters, or the basic ひとつ／ふたつ／．．． counters, or something completely different  I hate sounding too textbookish.

Most -eru and -aru pairs of verbs that I know are transitive/intransitive counterparts of each others. For example, 見つかる is the intransitive counterpart for the transitive 見つける, and 変わる is the intransitive counterpart for the transitive 変える.But there is one special pair of -eru and -aru that I know for sure is not transitive/intransitive. They are actually both transitives:預ける {あずける}  預かる {あずかる}Furthermore, the beautiful part of this pair is they are complementing each other by having each one of them covering the opposite sides of the action of 預ける / 預かる:子猫のチーを預けました。  I entrusted (someone) to take care of Chii the kitten.子猫のチーを預かりました。  (Someone) entrusted me to take care of Chii the kitten.Are there any other pairs of -eru/-aru verbs that have the similar relation with each other Is there special class of verbs for this kind of verb pairs Or is 預ける / 預かる the only pairp/s: I'm not sure how to write -eru in hiragana; 〜える looks weird because it seems to only covers verbs that literally end with える like かえる etc.
I noticed that even though Japanese language has kanji characters for numbers (e.g. 十、百、千、万　etc), there are many places where Arabic numerals are used instead, for example, prices for shop items are written as １００円 instead of 一百円.I am curious about:When did Arabic numerals start replacing Japanese numerals for writing numbers for normal daily uses (e.g. price tags, signboards, phone numbers etc)Other than writing small numbers like in dates (e.g. 十月九日), are there any places where large numbers are predominantly written using Japanese numerals (e.g. 六万五千七百二十四)For places that use Arabic numerals, when there are large yet trivial numbers, for example "three hundred millions", do you still write it as 300000000, or switch back to 三億 (since it saves space)

At university our most learned lecturer in Japanese once mentioned there were non-phonetic usages of hiragana at the end of kanji verbs and adjectives pre WWII. Apparently books printed prewar used this writing system, meaning old prints are illegible to modern Japanese speakers!This was said to be similar to English spelling in that kana were pronounced differently to normal sounds based on their position at the end of the word.Does anyone know of this spelling system Can you explain how it workedMy izakaya zatsugaku won't be complete without this and I've wondered about this for years!

This is my understanding but please correct me if some of my details are wrong:In 1946 the Japanese language underwent a reform and standardization processA set of 1850 kanji were made official and others more or less obsoletedA smaller subset of these kanji were simplified, the new forms becoming known as shinjitai and the previous forms as kyujitaiBut some words which used characters made obsolete had their spellings changed to use similar looking characters, my favourite being:"濠洲" (ごうしゅう, Gōshū), an ateji for "Australia" became "豪州"Does this replacement of characters have a name They are not shinjitai since they already existed and they are not in shinjitai tables.Does this only happen with ateji or also with regular wordsDoes it only happen when the replacement characters have a same reading as the replaced charactersIf not, does this add to the confusion of which readings apply to which characters
I noticed that 「もう」 can mean both "already" and "additional", such as the following sentence:もう二本飲みましたよ。Can mean either one of:I already drank two glasses.I drank additional two glasses.How can I differentiate between the two meanings
Feet are 足, and legs are also 足.Is there a word or method with which I can easily talk about one and not the other And if not, why is there no word for feet in the Japanese languageCaveat: I know that one can just use フィート but that feels so very not Japanese...
What is the proper response when someone tells you, for example, that their mother has died  Relatedly, what should you do to express your sympathy  Do you send a card flowers bake a casserole
Can anyone explain the difference between the words 創{そう}立{りつ}, 設{せつ}立{りつ} and 樹{じゅ}立{りつ}  They all basically mean "to set up / to found", and from what I've researched, it's all very 微{び}妙{みょう} to me.
I asked a female Japanese friend to translate a sentence for me and it ends in "nano" which I took to be either an alternative question particle to -ne or -ka; or possibly two particles I don't know which could come together.But just now I looked it up in wwwjdict and it tells me it's a "feminine copula". So does this mean "なの" (nano) is a synonym of "です" (desu) that only female speakers use Assuming it's not very formal, what should I use instead as a nounAlso does this mean it's a verb and if so what kind of conjugation or other forms does it haveEDITSince this has turned out to be quite subtle and even controversial, here is my sentence:(Original English: Why must life be so difficult)Japanese translation: なんで[人生]{じんせい}はそんなに[大変]{たいへん}なの？
I guess we could use the native Japanese numbers, 一つ, 二つ, 三つ...but we'd run into a problem at or after ten (not sure how とお works — same for はたち).Is there a general counter word that we can fallback on For example, if something is mechanical I'd probably fallback on 台 (だい), if it's flat 枚 (まい). For more general objects like 11 motorcycle helmets, or 15 packs of cigarettes, or 24 clothes hangers, could I fallback on something
To my knowledge there are three words which can be used in thanking and they seem to be usable together in some combinations:どうも (d­ōmo)どうもありがとう (dōmo arigatō)ありがとう (arigatō)ありがとうございます (arigatō gozaimasu)どうもありがとうございます (dōmo arigatō gozaimasu)Are there nuances of each of these words I know "dōmo" alone is informal and I assume the longer the combination the more formal or respectful.Are there rules as to how they can and can't be combined (Did I include any wrong combinations)
I would like to know if there is a shift in nuance in questions such as these:誰が参加したんですか。 vs. 誰が参加しましたか。いつ着いたんですか。 vs. いつ着きましたか。I wish to limit discussion to only non-yes/no questions (so questions asking Who When Where Why and so on). I have read a paper (PDF) which states that adding ～のか indicates that the asker's feelings of wanting to know the answer are stronger, and that it puts more of a burden of responding on the askee. Can anyone confirm or contradict this
I know that "わさび" 'wasabi' can also be written using kanji as "山葵" and that these two characters mean respectively "mountain" and "hollyhock", but hollyhock doesn't seem at first glance to be related.So are the hollyhock and wasabi plants related or are the kanji some kind of ateji which would explain why the hiragana spelling is more common. Or is the origin of the word something more subtle or mysterious
Can you give an example of when 帰る should be used instead of 戻る, and vice versa The reason I ask is that I sometimes get corrected when using the two, such as in:×　そのとき私は日本から戻ってきて、大学に戻って入りました。 (ignore the other problems with this ☺)  ○　そのとき私は日本から帰ってきて、大学に戻りました。
I heard this phrase a few times but I still can't grasp its meaning. Does it mean, "as much as you would like"
Thanking and apologizing in several forms is essential in a Japanese working environment. I currently have the following list that I have picked up from mails amongst my Japanese coworkers but I'm curious what could be other examples to do this...Thanks for pointing out my mistakes.ご指導を頂き、ありがとうございました。丁寧にご指導を頂き、ありがとうございました。丁寧にご指導を頂きまして有難うごいざいましたThanks for the feedback!添削ありがとうございます. とても助かります.意味を間違っておりました。教えていただきありがとうございます。どうぞよろしくお願いします。
Furthermore, what is its different in meaning between the both When I was in training as a fresh graduate at a Japanese company, they told me to use いつもお世話になっております all the time and so I did. But after being a assigned to a department they told me to stop doing so because it sounded too weird within the team. Does it also has something to do with status
Does the -ou / -you / -mashou (the "let's X") form have a negative counterpart For example, how do I say "let's not X" for the following:行こう食べよう寝ましょうAs far as I can remember, the Japanese courses I took in college did not teach me the negative of this form. Does it even exist If it does not exist, how do you say "let's not X" in Japanese
I noticed in songs, there are lyric lines that push the demonstrative adjective (*) この, その etc to the middle of sentences by switching it with an adjective/verb that describe the subsequent nouns. For example:この小さな 街{まち}で becomes 小さなこの街であの 戻{もど}れない日々 becomes 戻れないあの日々Is there any difference between the two sentence structures Or is it just to make the latter sound more poetic(*) Thanks repecmps for providing the correct English term there
This is an extension of the question: Using なるほど (naruhodo) and やっぱり (yappari) in the same situationFrom what I understood from the answers to the question above, なるほど and やっぱり imply the speaker's suspicion that he/she somehow and to some extent knows about the situation before getting the affirmation from the other party.However, what would the speaker say if it is revealed that the situation is opposite to what he/she was suspecting I know he/she can say "なに" (with a surprised face etc) but that is too strong an interjection, unlike the softer なるほど or やっぱり. I guess in English it might be something like "oh dear me". "なに" sounds more like "OMG!" to me.
In English, we just have one word for the conjunction and which works just fine for many categories, but in Japanese, there are separate words:と joins nouns together in a closed listや joins nouns together in an open listそして does it do something like joining clauses or run-on sentencesて joins adjectivesたり joins verbsも which I naively thought of as only meaning "too/also". し joins adjectives and verbsWhen can each be used and how should the language learner keep their usages straight and not confuse them
It's happened several times: I'll be chattering away with a friend in Japanese, and they'll sneeze, and without even thinking about it I'll revert back to English to say "bless you."  Is there a set phrase in Japanese I can use after someone sneezes
In my Japanese class we were taught that one does not need to thank a cashier when they check you out or a server when they bring you your meal, but I always feel awkward remaining silent.  Was my sensei wrong  Specifically:What is the usual exchange between customer and cashier when paying for an itemWhat is the usual exchange when a waiter brings you your foodWhen leaving a restaurant, is it appropriate to say ごちそうさまでした 美味しかったです ありがとうございました
I was told in class by a Japanese teacher that なるほど can not be used when talking with people above, but in the same lesson we listened to a CD (training material) where a student was saying なるほど to his teacher.Here at work I often hear my Japanese colleagues saying なるほど when talking with customers (consulting). Can I do the sameEDIT: A Japanese friend just told me she would never write it to a customer, even by email, but it is perfectly acceptable over the phone as an 相槌 (sound given during a conversation to indicate comprehension).
Here's an example sentence from 北斗の拳 which uses a fair amount of furigana throughout.xxxに残された命は三日...Which includes furigana for のこ, いのち, and, bafflingly, even the か of 日, but none for 三. While I already know that 三日 is みっか, there are plenty of other words with numbers that are beyond me. I'm sure I'm not the only student frustrated by this practice. What's the reasoning, if any, for this
According to Denshi Jisho, いい and よい share the same kanji, and that both roughly mean "good". Why are there two different pronunciations despite the similarity, and what are some ways to figure out which one to use
I noticed in an anime I watched, one of the characters said something like below:さっき食べたじゃない。  And what I think the meaning is: Didn't you just eat a few while agoFrom what I have learned in Japanese classes, 「じゃない」, which is the shortened form of 「ではない」, must follow a noun word/phrase/clause. But in the spoken sentence above the 「じゃない」 follows a 「～た」 form of a verb. Is that sentence grammatically correct Is this one of the many examples where colloquial language may skip a few grammar rules here and thereI think the sentence would be grammatically correct if there is　「ん」 in between the two phrases: 「さっき食べたんじゃない」. Did I actually mishear
To my knowledge there are three words which can be used in thanking and they seem to be usable together in some combinations:どうも (d­ōmo)どうもありがとう (dōmo arigatō)ありがとう (arigatō)ありがとうございます (arigatō gozaimasu)どうもありがとうございます (dōmo arigatō gozaimasu)Are there nuances of each of these words I know "dōmo" alone is informal and I assume the longer the combination the more formal or respectful.Are there rules as to how they can and can't be combined (Did I include any wrong combinations)
I see phrases like 200人ぐらい, 半々ぐらい, and 何分くらい, which seem to indicate that くらい and ぐらい are synonymous, if not interchangeable. Is there any kind of rule for deciding which to use, or is it a stylistic preference
I know, since they are of different word classes, なるほど (naruhodo) and やっぱり (yappari) may not be used interchangeably within the same sentence, but can they be used within the same situation insteadDoes it make sense if the same person says the following two statements one after anotherやっぱりそうだったねえ。なるほど。Or maybe the other way aroundなるほど。やっぱりそうだったねえ。Or are they mutually exclusiveEDIT:After reading answer from Derek, and after pondering on it for some time, I realized that what I actually wanted to ask also includes the following:Are there any situations where we can use なるほど but not やっぱり, or vice versaSorry for the confusion.
While it is generally safe to use -さん when taking to someone and the use of -先生 is appropriate for use in a school environment when talking to a teacher, would the use of -先生 carry over outside of the school environment if encounter the person under different circumstancesFor example, while the use of the honorifics is pretty obvious in a school environment, suppose the teacher of one of the classes starts to learn a new martial art where one of their students holds a higher rank within the art, how would this affect the use of honorifics
When are なんて and なんか used as emphasis in casual speech Are they used when you're surprised, angry or can it be both What sort of feeling does it convey to the listener compared to a normal sentence without it.For example, in the following 3 sentences I'm not entirely sure what the "なんて” and ”なんか” are expressing.こんな[所]{ところ}におばけなんていねーよ。There are no ghosts in a place like this.[彼女]{かのじょ}が[結婚]{けっこん}したなんてちっとも[知]{し}らなかった。I had no idea she got married.[私]{わたし}なんか3[枚]{まい}のレポートも[書]{か}けない。I cannot even write a 3 page report.
I know that we say にっぽん instead of にほん when we want to inject a little national pride into the word, but I've never had a good understanding of the difference in meaning/nuance/usage between やはり and やっぱり. I would guess that there is some variation in some combination of politeness, formality, familiarity etc, but I haven't had enough experiences with them to pin down where they sit on that graph.
When I was studying this, my 先生 kind of brushed over the point, and then years later, I realize that they are different, but I don't know exactly how.The only thing I understand is that ので is more polite.  I suppose that's because ので isn't actually "because" like から, but more a nominalized statement (の) followed by (で), making it more indirect (and we all know that indirect means more polite in Japanese).Anyone have any more information on the pair
As in the question title, what is the difference between the two sentences below一{いち}時{じ}間{かん}ほどかかります。  ichijikan hodo kakarimasu.   一時間ぐらいかかります。  ichijikan gurai kakarimasu.How do we choose to use one over the other
I recently confused 励{はげ}ます for the ~ます form of 禿{は}げる.Although this actually lead to a rather amusing conversation, I'm wondering if there are other examples of this to watch out for
Just to avoid repeatedly saying いただきました too much, can I occasionally switch it with 下さりました or 下さいました
My brother got on a scholarship to go to university in Japan, he was given a year an half language training and then had to apply to Japanese universities.I suggested he study in Osaka as I'd visited there and knew some people he could hang about with but he was advised not to study too far away from Tokyo as people would look down on him if he gained a regional accent.Is this actually the case I appreciate that they might make fun of locals with a regional accent but is would this apply to foreigners too
In some situations everybody around me use 重い, and when I went to the bicycle shop everyone was only using 重たい.Both mean heavy, but what is the difference in meaning or context between themCan something be 重い but not 重たい Or 重たい but not 重い
The Japanese language has a lot of patterns for "if" clauses. What are the differences among the following patterns and how do we choose to use one over the others:行くと行ったら行くなら行けば行くんだったら行くのなら行くとしたら行くことになったら行くならばp/s: Please add any other additional "if" patterns
I've been told during my Japanese classes, and I've also observed in anime and Japanese dramas &amp; movies, that sometimes when talking Japanese people tend to stop halfway and omit the end of sentence especially when the sentence has some negative connotation (e.g refusal etc). For example:鈴木: これをもっと安くしませんかねえ。  田中: それはちょっと。。 Suzuki: kore wo motto yasuku shimasen ka nee.  Tanaka: sore ha chotto ..Another example:鈴木: ブラウンさんの日本語はなかなか上手ですねえ。  ブラウン: いや、私はまだまだ。。  Suzuki: buraun-san no nihongo ha naka naka jouzu desu nee.  Brown: iya, watashi ha mada mada ..So is there a cultural reason for this behavior What is term for it And how should non-Japanese interpret or react if our questions or invitations are replied with such responsesMeta note: I notice myself that the last question is a bit subjective. Should we or should we not allow this kind of subjective questions in Japanese SE
What is the difference in usage between 行ったから and 行ってから and 行くから Is there a sense of sequence implied in one and not the otherIn the following examples where would i be buying the book and where would i be saying this  Like in I bought the book after i arrived in america.アメリカに行くから本を買うアメリカに行ってから本を買うアメリカに行ったから本を買う
When thanking someone, what is the rule for using ありがとうございます vs. ありがとうございました  My sensei taught us to use ありがとうございました when the action you're thanking someone for occurred in the past, but I've heard ありがとうございます used plenty of times right after the action occurred.  Does it have to do with how far in the past the action happened
As far as I know, 「[同じ]{おなじ}」  is not a 形容詞{けいようし} (-i adjective) so how does it become 「[同じく]{おなじく}」 Or does 「同じく」 not come from 「同じ」Also, are there any other non i-adjectives that have -ku counterparts (regardless of the answer for above)
As far as I know only three words (or particles) have irregular, non-phonetic spelling in Japanese:"は" - The topic particle is pronounced "wa" but the kana is otherwise pronounced "ha""へ" - The movement towards particle is pronounced "e" but the kana is otherwise pronounced "h""を" - The kana is only used for the object particle as far as I know and in the kana table takes the position of "wo" but pronunciation seems to hover somewhere between "o" and "wo"So did the sounds of these particles change since the spelling was set down Or were the spellings intentionally chosen for some reason Are there any other irregular kana spellings I omitted(P.S. I found the question Why is は pronounced as わ when used as a topic particle while working on this question but since mine is broader I decided to go ahead anyway, plus it might give an opportunity to test our duplicate marking strategies here)EDITSome of the comments to Lukman's answer below suggests that these might not seem like irregular sounds or kana to native speakers. I was surprised that people interpreted this question to be about romaji rather than being about kana and particles as I intended it.So a further question: Are these particles and their kana and pronunciations seen as irregular by native Japanese speakers Or just to learners of Japanese And what do Japanese and non-Japanese linguists think
In Nate Glenn's answer to bdonlan's qestion "Why were ゐ and ゑ eliminated" he states:"Wi" and "we" are still in some dialects, but standard Japanese does not have those sounds.My question is which dialects are they which preserve these sounds Plus I wonder if these dialects are on occasion still written with these obsolete kana
There is a song with title {hajimete no asa} and another song with title {hajime no hi}. There is also a manga title {hajimete no aku}, and not to forget the popular boxing manga {hajime no ippo}.So what is the difference between 「はじめてのX」 {hajimete no X} and 「はじめのX」 {hajime no X} How do we choose to use one over the other
This comment can be seen very often on Japanese message boards.
These two dialects will sound very similar to an untrained ear. Can anyone highlight the main differences between these two dialects
I know that romaji is the conversion from those to the roman alphabet, but what are the differences or characteristics between katakana, kanji, and hiraganaAre they used on a different context Is one of them more formal than the others Do they have something in common
Romaji is somewhat of a conversion from kanji and kana to the Roman alphabet.What are the disadvantages of learning only or mostly romaji aside from being unable to read/write in kanji I don't think there are many advantages.
The particle は is pronounced similarly to わ (unlike the rest of the ハ行 kana) when used as a particle; why is this What historical shifts went on to cause this irregularity
The ヶ in e.g. 一ヶ月 is a bit of an odd character - it looks a lot like a small version of the katakana ケ, but is it derived from that katakana originally Or is it a normal kanji Or is it something else entirely
I'll be visiting Yamagata City soon and would like to ask:as an armchair linguist what features of the local dialect to look out forwhat are some common words, phrases, pronunciation differences that I could try to effect to make a nice impression on the locals
What's the difference between ね and な as tag questionsFor example:そうですねvsそうだなIs there any difference in level of politeness  Does one sound more masculine than the otherEdit:The examples above are pretty vague (or even just plain wrong in terms of actually being tag questions).  The more concrete example from Amanda S better illustrates my question:パーティは明日だな (The party is tomorrow, right)vsあの子はたけしですね (That child is Takeshi, right)
Both "ようこそ" (y­ōkoso) and "いらっしゃいませ" (irasshaimase) seem to mean "welcome" but what are the precise circumstances under which each should be used"いらっしゃいませ" (irasshaimase) is uttered in unison by all the staff whenever you walk into a restaurant or shop"ようこそ" (y­ōkoso) was used in a recent "Welcome to Japan" advertising campaignBut this is just based on my very limited experience so I'm obviously missing lots of subtleties and insights.
Given the close proximity and long history of interaction of various kinds within East Asia, the great influence of Chinese in both Japanese and Korean, and the similar structures of Japanese and Korean, are there any old words known to have come into Japanese from Korean, and if so, are there any which are written in kanjiWe know that modern Korean loanwords are written in katakana such as "キムチ" (kimuchi) from "김치" (kimchi) and "ビビンバ" (bibinba) from "비빔밥" (bibimbap), but surely there must be some words taken much longer ago - what are some of them and how are they written
I think I know the answer to this, but it still creeps up in my mind all the time; something I'd like to research more.  I want to know technical differences as well as common usage.When do you use the passive form of a transitive verb versus just using the intransitive verb  For example, 教【おし】えられる versus  教【おそ】わる.Amaze me with your answers!
Two numbers in Japanese have two pronunciation alternatives.四 / 4 can be pronounced either "よん" (yon) or "し" (shi)七 / 7 can be pronounced either "しち" (shichi) or "なな" (nana)I know that "し" (shi) can be avoided because it has the same pronunciation as "死" which means "death" but how strong is the taboo and how does it relate to factors such as formality and politeness when choosing which form to use Is it just a matter of superstition or should speakers be more sensitive"しち" (shichi) vs "なな" (nana) seems to be less discussed since it doesn't involve taboo or superstition as far as I know but again what about formality and politeness etc
Here's a question for you experts.  I've actually asked this to my Japanese friends, but I want to see how you guys answer too.Explain the differences in the following verbs and which one(s) appear more commonly in everyday speech:[掴]{つか}む[捕]{と}る[捕]{と}らえる[捕]{と}らえられる - passive[捕]{つか}まえる[捕]{つか}まえられる - passive[捕]{と}らわれる[捕]{つか}まる - see update belowUpdate - 2012/05/08:  Looking back at this question after all this time, I knew there was a reason I was including the passive verbs (4 and 6 above).  It's because I left a verb out of my original set:  [捕]{つか}まる.  So then the question with the passives is, what's the difference between 捕まる, 捕らえられる, and 捕まえられるBased on @Derek Schaab's answer below, it seems that 捕らえられる would mostly apply to animals/things that "are caught".  But which would be the most correct/natural way to say "The criminal was finally caught"犯人がやっと(捕まった・捕らえられた・捕まえられた）
There are at least four verbs that mean "to do" in Japanese: する, なさる, いたす, and やる. What is the purpose of each, and when is it appropriate to use them
There are several situations in which one of these words (phrases) should be used but there's not usually a 1:1 mapping between any two languages.Get somebody's permission. English: "excuse me", "I beg your pardon"; Spanish: "disculpe"Getting past somebody or through a crowd. English: "excuse me"; Spanish: "con permiso"Apologising: English: "I'm sorry"; Spanish: "lo siento", "perdón"In Japanese, which of "すみません" (sumimasen) or "ごめんなさい" (gomen'nasai) works for each situation (And did I leave out any situations or phrases)
The phrase 心の冷たい人 (which is given by Japanese-English dictionary on OS X) looks wrong to me, but given that it's an example in a respected dictionary and confirmed by tens of thousands of Google hits, I have to assume it's correct. It's a lot less clumsy than how I'd naïvely write it, 冷たい心がある人, but its word order still doesn't line up with anything else I've seen. Is this just an idiomatic saying that I should just accept as correct, or is this a pattern that shows up a lot
How do you handle learning new verbs that have both transitive and intransitive forms  Is it best to immediately memorize both forms
Given that there has been discussion by the Japanese government to use the Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT) as one of the measures by which permanent residences or citizenship might be granted, how good of a measure of it of actual real world Japanese skill Does passing the level N1 test mean that you are on par with a native speaker or does it just show that you have advanced knowledge of the language
Recently a friend of mine threw the term 意味くじピーマン (imi kuji pi-man) into a story she was telling, and it totally threw me off. At first I thought, because I wasn't sure how to parse the くじ part, it meant something like "meaningful peppers."Then a friend said it meant "no meaning at all", but that definition seemed to be a little mundane given how colourful the expression is. Surely it has more nuanceI looked it up, but wasn't able to find a straight forward definition. And even if it does mean "no meaning at all", how do you get that from:意味 = いみ, meaningくじく = crush or breakピーマン = pepper...
I've seen this symbol in various places, such as 「日々」, 「色々」, and 「人々」. What is it, and how does it affect the meaning and pronunciation of the word

Improve this question                    How to write hiragana and katakana in Windows (XP/Vista/7) My current locale is Swedish and I have a hard time writing hiragana and katakana characters.Usually I have a txt-file open in notepad and copy the individual characters, but that is (obviously) not efficient.The same also applies for kanji.
I've seen it used in many places, and sometimes it feels like a connection between words.For example in 「鳥の詩」 (tori no uta), it looks as if the の is connecting 鳥 (tori) and 詩 (uta), and I would like to know what it represents, in this case at least.
It is common to ask the difference between just "へ" (-e) and "に" (-ni) but it seems to get even more complicated when you also mix in "まで" (made) and even "の方" (no-hō).When Japanese people ask me where I'm going they always ask "どこまで" (doko made)" rather than "どこへ" (doko e) or "どこに" (doko ni) that I expected.I know "まで" (made) can mean "until" but when I ask the difference with "に" (ni) and "へ" (e) I'm told "へ" (e) means "to" and "に" (ni) means "in the direction of" but if this is the case then how do they differ from "の方" (no-ho) which I already learned previously meant "in the direction of"
Saying "now" is easy, with 今, but in my experience that doesn't express so much "right now, this instant" as it does "currently". I am looking for structure that translates these examples well:I have just now been thinking about that.At that exact moment, X happened.Edit: I also know that I have heard a grammatical structure for "I was in the middle of something (watching TV) and then I was interrupted by X (the phone ringing / an earthquake)". Anyone knows what I mean
「ゆう」 is neither the kun'yomi nor on'yomi of 「昨」 and 「べ」 is not a pronunciation of 「夜」 either. The same can be said about the pronunciation 「きょう」 for 「今日」.So how come the pronunciations of the two words are like those If they are special, what was the origin of such pronunciationsEDIT:To respond to Mark Hosang answer on ゆうべ, from my dictionary software:p/s: yup, the "sakuya" pronunciation is also there :)
When asking for something I seem to hear sentences end in both ください (kudasai) and お願いします (onegaishimasu). Is there a difference and how do I know when to use which
As the equivalent of Enlgish "Oh really" / "Yes really." as lone utterances I seem to hear both "本当" (hontō) and "本当に" (hontō-ni) in Japanese - is there a differenceIt seems that hontō is a noun and -ni changes it into an adverb but that this doesn't really matter for the purpose of such simple utterances. Am I thinking along the right lines
I'm accustomed to saying together with using the ~ to issho ni fragment, but I've been noticing that some people I talk to phrase this using ~ totomo ni instead.i.e.彼女と一緒に日本へ来た。Kanojo to issho ni Nihon e kita.and 彼女とともに日本へきた。Kanojo totomo ni Nihon e kita.seem to be fundamentally equivalent.Are there any nuances that the two have that dictates when and where they should be used Probably very slight meaning deviations Or are they essentially perfect equivalents of each other when it comes to saying together with (and yeah, I'm aware that ~ totomo ni has other meanings aside from that)
I have been taught that they are used when receiving something (or a favor) from someone. But how exactly do they differ I've searched the web for an answer andOne site suggests that くれます is impolite, もらいます is normal and いただきます is polite.Another site says that くれます is just normal, and いただきます is very polite. I was wondering which one to use in which situations. Or should I just stick to いただきます to be safe Are there any scenarios where it would be inappropriate
My teacher who practices haiku told me that in haiku they still use the traditional names for months. I was wondering which other words are still used in haiku.
What is the difference between the "わ" sentence ender used by women in general and the one that is used by both Males and females in the Kansai area I've asked my Japanese co-workers about it specifically and they said that there is a difference to them, but unfortunately, like most native speakers of a language, couldn't concretely explain what that difference is.One comment was that women can say "~わね" where this cannot be said by men in the Kansai area.
There is a clause pattern 「XければXほどY」. For example, 「近【ちか】ければ近【ちか】いほど便【べん】利【り】」 which means something like "the nearer it is, the more convenient it will be". Can I shorten the clause to 「近【ちか】いほど便【べん】利【り】」 Will it have the same meaningBut I have a feeling when I use 「XほどY」 when X and Y are opposite to each other, it will give the meaning of "X yet Y" in English. For example, 「近【ちか】いほど届【とど】かない」 would give the meaning of "close yet unreachable", in a poetic sense. Am I right

And a newspaper is just as hard.I know around 600-800 kanji, and I can pass the level 2 listening JLPT, though I'm not quite there for reading and grammar (I can barely pass level 3 on those), but I feel like I've been spinning my wheels and not getting anywhere for a long time now.What are good techniques for learning to read in Japanese Especially for self-taught students of Japanese.What are techniques to push through the vast wasteland that is "intermediate"
If you visit ニコニコ動画 or any Japanese message boards often you are bound to see comments like ニコ厨 or 東方厨. Does anyone have good idea how did this originate and what do they mean
-ず and -ぬ are two alternatives to the negative form -ない / -ません. But I noticed that depending on the word, it's either -ず or -ぬ, although it seems like some words can take both suffixes. Some examples I have encountered:-ず知らず (lyric in song "touch" by Younha)わからず (lyric in song "aisuru mono" by Angela Aki)せず (song title: "yudan sezu ni ikou")なれず (lyric in song "mirae he" by Kiroro)-ぬ気づかぬ (lyric in song "arigatou" by Kokia)届かぬ (song title: "todokanu omoi")ならぬ (lyric in song "shunrai" by Yellow Generation)both -ず and -ぬとらず / とらぬできず / できぬSo are there rules for choosing between -ず and -ぬ
I always get this two whenever I make a mistake. I think that more or less they are similar but kind of have the feeling that 突っ込まれる has a bit stronger meaning than 指摘される, is this correctFor example, He pointed out my mistakes (rough translation, I'd think) 彼に指摘された。 彼に突っ込まれた。
A slight expansion of the existing thread What is the difference between 「はずがない」 and 「わけがない」, but what is the difference or use cases for when to use はずがない, わけがない, しょうがない
Last week I saw the word 閾値 and when looking it up in Gjiten I see two pronunciations, both marked as "popular":閾値 (いきち) (n) threshold (amount, dose, etc.); (P); 閾値 (しきいち) (n) threshold (amount, dose, etc.); (P); Which one should I useIn the context of professional discussion with colleagues and clients, if that matters.

Due to the fact that many phrases in anime are not used in normal Japanese conversation, can you learn real Japanese from anime/manga)
In English it seems that cold is just always cold just as warm and hot regardless of whether the word describes a person's experience or the actual physical state of an object. In Japanese however there seems to be a strange case where when describing a cold weather versus a cold drink you would use the words [寒]{さむ}い or [冷]{つめ}たい respectively, which both seem to translate to the word cold in English. This difference has always been confusing to me and I can't seem to develop a rule-of-thumb to follow in order to choose the right word for the right situation.I've heard it described by some native Japanese speakers that 寒い should be used for things that you cannot touch. My assumption is that by "cannot touch" this is referring to things in a more abstract concept such as weather or the day and not things that are simply out of reach physically such as a distant planet, however I haven't been able to confirm the last case.Another point that I think is interesting is that the words warm and hot in English do not seem to have the same Japanese word counterparts where one is more direct translation and the other means "to the touch" but instead warm and hot in Japanese appear to be simply あたたかい and あつい respectively. Am I missing something, perhaps there are other word analogies for these other adjectives of which I'm just unaware.As requested here are a few examples that demonstrate my confusion as far as proper usage of these two words.空気は寒い when speaking of feeling of the air when stepping out of the house.水は冷たい when wading through some cold water.私はさむい when describing one's physical feeling caused by any of the above.
Why are the stroke orders for 右 and 左 different右 starts with the vertical stroke, and 左 starts with the horizontal one.
Some song lyrics in the official lyric book that accompanies the CD is sung as another word. Usually, the way it is sung is given as a furigana on the kanji:Written: 君が希望に変わってゆく　　　　　　　　(pardon the quality I took it using iPhone)Sung: きみがゆめにかわってゆく(ひとりじゃない by DEEN)Written: 未来を今描こうSung: あすをいまえがこう(Pray by Every Little Thing)I wonder why write the word "希望" in the first place. Why not just print word "ゆめ" since you won’t hear the word "きぼう" in the song anyway Is there a cultural/artistic reason for it
I have been hearing 死ねばいいのに twice last week, including once in a context where a bit of formality was required.What does it mean Is it as violent as it sounds to meI am not looking for a word-by-word translation. I think it has to be taken as a whole expression, a kind of idiom.EDIT: I just found this usage example on HATENA::KEYWORD:あいつ「練習なんでドタキャンしたんだよ」って聞いたら、「彼女がデートしようって突然言うからさぁ」だって。ははは。まったくあいつらしいや。死ねばいいのに。
I'm a beginner and am learning from CD (Pimsleur). There are two native speakers going through the dialogue. One, the man, pronounces が as I would expect - 'ga'. The other (female) pronounces it as 'nga'.How common is the latter Which should I used Is the usage split along gender, age or geographic lines
I recently came across the expression 前提に:feature1はfeature2と同じく各コンテンツに分類用の識別子を埋め込む機能ですが、統制を重視したユースケースを前提に設計されているため柔軟さに欠けます。  'feature1, just like feature2, is a way to embed classification into content, but it is designed for rigidity-focussed use cases, losing in flexibility.'I think it means "to require", but I am very unsure, could someone confirm/infirm this
ご[馳走様]{ちそうさま}でした is the greeting that people say after being offered a meal while ご馳走 by itself means “a feast”.I looked up this word in the dictionary to learn more about the kanji characters. It turned out that both 馳 and 走 have the meaning of “run”, or more specifically 馳 is “to gallop” and 走 is “to run”.So how come two “run” kanji characters give the meaning of “a feast” Would anyone explain the etymology of the wordP.S. ご is just a prefix you add to a noun to make it sound more polite.
I know the following two sentences give implication that "not expecting me to understand (it)" but I have a feeling that they give different nuances that I just can't put my finger on:それは分{わ}かるわけがないでしょう。  sore wa wakaru wake ga nai deshou.それは分{わ}かるはずがないでしょう。  sore wa wakaru hazu ga nai deshou.Would someone explain what is the difference of the two sentences, and also how to choose between using はず and わけ
「神{かみ}のみぞ知{し}るセカイ」 is the title of a manga/anime series but I'm not asking about the anime. I'm just curious about the 「ぞ」 part in the title.I know there is a ぞ particle that is similar to よ, such that 行{い}くぞ is similar to 行くよ. But I have never encountered よ nor ぞ in the middle of a sentence/clause before, so this made me curious.Which part of speech is that ぞ What connotation does it bring and how do we use it in a sentencep/s: I know the ぞ is not a part of のみぞ because when I entered のみぞ in my Japanese dictionary software it only returned のみ = “only" so I deduced that the ぞ is a separate word.
かしら is generally considered to be a question particle for use by females; are there any situations or dialects in which it is usable by males I'm aware that historically, it was used by both male and female speakers; I'm mostly concerned about modern usage.Edit: I'm quite aware that, normally, it sounds quite odd. I'm more concerned about whether there are exceptional situations or dialects where male かしら usage is common enough not to sound odd.
Recently I came across this sentence in a computing-related technical document:some software と連携させ、 some feature のカスタマイズを作成します。I get the meaning (after having integrated some product, we will customize some feature), but my question is:In this sentence, does させ come from the verb 刺す or just する
